https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/odlocitev-2022-tretje-soocenje-na-pop-tv.html,"'We cannot regulate lobbying tentacles in healthcare, we can only cut them off'","At this third confrontation, representatives of eight parties, which according to the latest Mediana opinion polls show the best and have the opportunity to break into parliament, shared their views on health policy. They talked about their candidates for Minister of Health, about plans to eliminate corruption in health care, solve waiting times and staffing problems. We asked representatives of the party's youth how to help young people who are experiencing worsening mental distress due to the epidemic.","The health department is one of the most demanding, it can even be crucial in the success of the new government, so all coalition parties must agree on it, on who will lead it. We already had 20 ministers of health, only three of them lasted the entire term, and on average they were in office for less than a year and a half.
At today's confrontation of Decisions 2022, representatives of the parties that according to the latest Mediana opinion polls show the best and have the opportunity to break into parliament, presented their views on the health care system in Slovenia and health issues that go beyond the last corona crisis.
The show hosted 16 party representatives, namely Robert Golob and Lucija Tacer (Freedom Movement), Jelko Godec and Andrej Hoivik (SDS), Dejan Židan and Luka Goršek (SD), Miha Kordiš and Arnej Jakob Zakrajšek (Left), Jani Möderndorfer and Jakob Kužnik (LMŠ), Janez Cigler Kralja and Katja Berk Bevc (NSi), Alenko Bratušek and Rebeka Ostrovršnik (SAB) and Tino Bregant and Kajo Galič (Connect Slovenia).
Who would you choose as Minister of Health?
At the presentation of the candidates of the Freedom Movement, the party's candidate, orthopedist Danijel Bešič Loredan, announced that he will be the new Minister of Health if Robert Golob is the new Prime Minister. Asked whether he had been promised this position in advance, Golob replied: ""Healthcare is the key department at the moment. Our team is led by orthopedist Danijel Besic Loredan, who will also be our candidate for health minister."" He added that Bešič Loredan is known to the public for pointing out corruption. “He is one of the few brave doctors who can change the system for the better,” he explained.
""If I had to choose for myself, today I would choose someone who, in addition to the health care system, also knows public finances and the economy,"" said Alenka Bratušek, pointing out that money is also a big health problem. Dejan Židan believes that the ideal Minister of Health is a person who will primarily have the interests of patients.
Jani Möderndorfer has replaced four parties since becoming a member of parliament, three of whom have been in government. He sharply criticized LMŠ Minister Sam Fakin, saying that it was unusual for someone to be elected Minister of Health who had done nothing at the helm of the health fund for nine years. He was an SMC MP at the time. Now, however, he has moved right into the party, which he says appoints bad ministers. ""The Minister of Health must be good with the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance,"" Möderndorfer replied.
Jelka Godec said that they would talk to coalition parties about who would be the minister. ""Predictions about who will be the minister are out of place. Whoever calls himself in advance is not a good minister for me,"" she said. Regarding informing people via Twitter in the late hours, she said the reason was that government meetings also took place late into the night. “The key to me is that people have been informed,” she said.
Tina Bregant is a candidate for Minister of Health of the Let's Connect Slovenia movement. In the POP TV studio, she claimed that she had not agreed in advance with anyone on the function. “The health minister needs to be someone who knows patients and the health care system,” she believes. She added that this is a person who will need the support of the entire government and citizens. “Our health is so overwhelmed that one man alone will not be able to save him,” she remarked.
To the accusations that she was a guest on a TV show when she should have been in self-isolation due to contact with an infected person, thus violating anti-crown measures, she explained that this was not true. ""I was working from home at the time, but I was neither in isolation nor in quarantine.""
What about corruption in healthcare?
There is a growing distrust of health care due to systemic corruption. For the first time in the history of independent Slovenia, three doctors have been sentenced to prison for corruption.
As a member of the SMC, Golob's candidate for deputy Janja Sluga defended Minister Zdravko Počivalšek at his interpellation. Golob, who says he is economically independent and immune to corruption, says he has zero tolerance for corruption. “We have checked to see if any of our candidates have violated the principle of personal integrity and according to our information no one has,” he said.
In order to avoid corruption, the SAB proposes that healthcare procurement be carried out in one place. ""Across Slovenia, we would order for all public institutions in one place,"" she suggested.
In our show 24UR ZVEČER, we revealed photos of Prime Minister Janša from 2016, how he hangs out with Božo Dimnik on the private yacht Andrej Marčič. Marcic, meanwhile, has earned more than 100m euros in public money since 2003 - mostly from the Oncology Institute, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Defense. ""Such transactions, where such gentlemen are present, need to be further investigated, and the bodies investigating them must be independent. This is a bit harder to expect from the current composition, but that will change on April 24,"" Zidan warned.
Golob also commented on Godčeva's work and said that he was sorry for her. ""She was one of the biggest fighters against corruption when she was in opposition in parliament. Today, unfortunately, she is in a position where she has to be quiet and defend the actions of those who vacationed in Mauritius, without being able to explain how they got the money , ""he pointed out. Godčeva told him not to feel sorry for her, as she was not defending anyone. According to her, the SDS has implemented everything it wrote in the coalition agreement.
Kordiš pointed out that lobbying tentacles in healthcare cannot be regulated because they have become politically too powerful. ""We can only cut them off. How? By setting up a public agency to procure medical devices directly from manufacturers and for the country as a whole,"" he said.
Židan and Godčeva got involved in a verbal duel. ""The problem is when the right comes up with a potentially good solution in this term - such as comparing prices with Austria, Germany. Then they add their allowance - here it was 10 percent. Why should ultrasound in Slovenia cost 10 percent more than in Austria , Germany and Finland? "" asked Zidan. Godčeva told him that it now costs 50 percent more. Židan replied: ""Did you reserve 10 percent?""
Bregant, meanwhile, is convinced that an effective anti-corruption system in healthcare is informatization.
One of the major problems is waiting times. How would customers deal with them?
The spectators of the confrontation could hear the story of Aljaž Škrjanc, a rheumatology patient. It took as many as seven years for him to be diagnosed because no one believed that such a young man could have a severe form of rheumatism. Of course, early diagnosis is crucial, but queues make it impossible.
""Data on how few interventions have been performed and how much money is left shows that we have a big problem with health records. The solution NSi sees is in digitization,"" Cigler King said. Regarding queues, he added that the problem was not money, but management, which should be improved and regulated. ""A system needs to be put in place to allow doctors in the public system to do their job. If they want to work extra then I don't know why they would limit it,"" he said.
Informatization helps with waiting times, Bregant pointed out. She presented the Cancer Registry, which is an example of effective informatization, and stressed that the example of good practice of the Oncology Institute should be transferred to other hospitals in the country.
Židan believes that someone who works in a public hospital cannot work in the afternoon in a private institution. ""The queues began to lengthen markedly when they were allowed to work from the public system in the private afternoon. That's when the financial reason was established,"" he said, adding that we increased the number of doctors from 2,700 to 4,100. ""What happened to the amount of work done? Until we make it clear that you have to do your work in your hospital, if you can do more, we pay you more, but you can't transfer work to a private individual and earn money there,"" he said. The party's program states that amphibians should not be banned but restricted.
Bratušek, meanwhile, emphasized the setting of norms. ""A study done by Mr. Fakin at an orthopedic clinic shows that one doctor works three times more than another. Norms need to be set to determine how much a doctor has to work in eight hours,"" she explained. Golob believed that the primary part, family doctors, should be relieved through informatization. ""If they are relieved of administrative work, they will find it easier to do their job,"" he said.
""We allow the public health system to be an economic activity. We cannot make profits on people and their diseases. It is simply degenerate, no normal society has that,"" Möderndorfer said.
""I would expect the government, especially in crisis situations, to take priority in clearing the data and getting people to the specialists they need. But this has not happened,"" Kordis said, stressing that the Left had pointed this out. but they were ignored, ""because the government had above all an interest in feeding its friends among private doctors.""
Solving problems with medical staff
The number of vaccinated per day has fallen sharply since the death of 20-year-old Katja. Despite calls from the profession to stop vaccinating Janssen, the state ordered the vaccine on the same day. Godčeva replied that the EMA had not yet said at the time that this vaccine should not be given. ""The vaccine was recognized at the time. It was not yet known that same day, the commission later found that the death was due to vaccination and the minister immediately banned vaccination with Janssen. ""NSi did not oppose this at the time, but was silent. judge which vaccine is appropriate and which is not.He noted that the vaccine has been effective in DSOs as mortality has been dramatically reduced.
Bratušek said that the SAB is in favor of keeping vaccination voluntary and that many things went wrong in this epidemic. ""Too many dead in the first wave - the elderly, retirees in DSOs. That, in our estimation, could have been prevented.""
SAB does not have a new Infectious Diseases Clinic among its priorities, but a regional hospital in Ljubljana. Who would work in it with such a shortage of staff as we have in Slovenia? ""This cannot be solved overnight, some enrollment at the Faculty of Medicine has already increased. Those who would use the regional hospital are now users of services in the clinical center, so they would divide - the most difficult forms would be left in the clinical center and the regional hospital in Ljubljana. it needs it like all other regions, but unfortunately it doesn't, ""she said.
""An even worse crisis than with primary care staff is in the area of ​​nurses and paramedics,"" Kordis said, adding that we have 10 percent of amphibian doctors who are actively creating queues. ""This amphibian practice should be banned."" Möderndorfer believed that doctors did not go abroad, but to private individuals.
Bregant added that most doctors are missing at the primary level. Golob pointed out that young doctors with a working life of up to 10 years are the ones we need to recognize and retain, as they have borne the brunt of this epidemic. Židan, however, said that the SD would significantly increase the salaries of family doctors because they are deprived.
What do the offspring of the customers say?
In the final part of the show, representatives of the party's youth came to the studio and talked about the mental distress of young people. As a result of the epidemic, these are still ongoing, even more so: they are deepening because many do not get adequate help.
In the youth of the Left, they say that the answer lies only in a radical change in the system in which we live. Arne Jakob Zakrajšek (Left) pointed out that the problems that young people have experienced are not isolated problems, but stem from what we are like as a society. “Many young people have to work while studying to be able to have a roof over their heads,” he said, noting that many young people have been pushed into even greater distress by the measures. ""The measures have resulted in a loss of income and evictions from dormitories, leaving some homeless,"" he said.
The vice-president of the Slovenian Democratic Youth, Andrej Hoivik, said that distance learning for young people was a difficult ordeal. He said schools would not be closed as socialization is extremely important. He pointed out that we had a lot of sporting success during the epidemic. “Young people felt that if they train and get active, they can overcome these hardships as well,” he said. He then looked at the camera and addressed the young people: ""Don't be depressed, be active. Join us in the Slovenian Democratic Youth and I think that this depression will soon go away.""
""In the Connect Slovenia movement, we will focus on intergenerational connections at the local level, where children and young people will have a safe environment, social inclusion and be able to turn to their loved ones in case of problems,"" said Kaja Galič, head of the Slovene People's Youth. customers. She added that they will place the greatest emphasis on prevention.
""Prevention is key to preventing hardships,"" said Katja Berk Bevc, president of Mlada Slovenije, who also emphasized the importance of the family. ""If we strengthen families, we will find it easier to overcome crises in the future. At the moment, we definitely need the most curative in the field of mental distress,"" she said, explaining that the money should be used for psycho-social assistance.
The Young Forum proposes to curb mental distress through a system of systematic review. ""Every 16-year-old would visit a psychologist or psychiatrist, which would put an end to mental distress in a timely manner,"" said the forum's president Luka Goršek. He added that the next government, whatever it may be, will have to provide more capacity for hospitalizations in Slovenia. He also emphasized the issue of alcoholism, which he said also leads to violence. “Women and young people are usually affected,” he said, calling for preventive action to prevent more severe mental distress among young people.
""First we need to shorten the queues and we will do this most directly by investing in specializations in psychology, as we have too few psychologists,"" said Lucija Tacer, president of the youth movement at the Freedom Movement. At the same time, he is aware that such a measure will not have an immediate effect, so they also want to strengthen assistance in the education system, especially by increasing the number of counselors in compulsory education.
""Clinical psychologists and psychiatrists are not the only profile that deals with mental distress,"" said Jakob Kužnik (LMŠ) and stressed the importance of the legal regulation of psychotherapy. ""Before psychological distress grows into a psychological problem or a problem, we must ensure immediate treatment. How to do it? We are already arranging the field of psychotherapy so that it will be of high quality and accessible through the public system,"" he said.
""The destigmatization of mental health is also important. Many young people do not dare to seek help because they are afraid of what their surroundings will think,"" said Rebeka Ostrovršnik from the Alenka Bratušek Party.
The veracity and credibility of the statements of the party representatives were verified during the confrontation, and the results were published in the Facts section.
We invited these clients on the basis of research conducted for our media house by the Mediana Institute.

What pensions will those working today have? Will it be possible to live or just survive in old age?"" explains the show's editor Kristina Hacin.
The team is therefore preparing for two confrontations; one will be on April 12th and the other on April 19th. ""A lot has been said in recent years. And a lot will be said this last month. Our task is to make it easier for you to decide. To remind you of something and, above all, to find out what future political parties promise us and how much of it this is the reality and how much is a promise, ""says leader Gregor Trebušak. Co-leader Nuša Lesar nods: ""Whether you are interested in politics or not, it has a significant impact on our lives. In order to decide which people will hold the canvas and scissors of our lives for the next four years, we help you illuminate their intentions. . ""

From April 11, one of the party presidents will be a guest in the studio every day, and his life and work will be presented in a different way, which will be taken care of by journalist Aleksander Pozvek. ""Candidates will be encouraged to show themselves in a completely human light. We will also put them on a field that is not familiar to them. they wouldn't burn. """
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/davki-epidemije-odpadle-operacije-slabsa-dostopnost-do-zdravnikov-in-zapoznele-diagnoze.html,"Epidemic taxes: Delayed surgeries, reduced availability of doctors and delayed diagnoses","Access to health care has declined significantly during the epidemic. Cancellations of examinations and procedures, over-ordering, a million fewer visits of sick patients to personal physicians and just under a million fewer referrals issued in two years are already reflected in the deteriorating health of many patients. There are fewer diagnoses or these are set later when the prospects for successful treatment are worse. In addition, today 15,000 more patients are waiting for health services for an unacceptably long time than two years ago.","Measures to prevent the spread of the virus and the redeployment of medical staff to human wards have contributed to the fact that many interventions or. operations that were not vital, dropped out during the epidemic or have been moved.
In the evening, the third pre-election confrontation will take place on POP TV, this time on the topic of healthcare. The positions and opinions of eight representatives of the parties that are ranked the best according to the latest Mediana research and have the opportunity to enter the National Assembly will be discussed.
Official data on how many surgeries and procedures were dropped during this time are not available - we asked the Ministry of Health, the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) and the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia (ZZZS) - so we selected 30 orthopedic , cardiac and other operations or. interventions and compare how many have been performed in recent years.
The number of selected orthopedic surgeries in 2020 decreased by a quarter compared to the year. If in 2019 more than 18,000 selected nine orthopedic surgeries were performed in the country, such as spine surgery, hip endoprosthesis, knee and foot surgery, in 2020 there are almost 4,000 fewer. In 2020, more than a fifth less selected heart surgeries and procedures were performed, and almost a quarter less, for example, hernia surgeries.
As a result, patients wait longer for surgeries and procedures. While before the epidemic they waited with an emergency referral very quickly - meaning they should be treated within 14 days - for an average of 27 days for orthopedic ankle or foot surgery, today, according to the NIJZ, they wait more than four months.
Also, for example, adults today have to wait almost two years on tonsil surgery under general anesthesia (referral regularly), less than a year before the epidemic. Waiting for knee and hip replacement, heart surgery, etc. has been lengthened.
Call for shortening queues - for 85 percent of patients the new date was not appropriate
The Ministry of Health overcame the long queues, which were even longer during the epidemic, with a tender that would - as promised - bring about 20,000 patients to the procedure or diagnostic procedure faster, who waited longer than last July. is permissible. The result? Instead of 20,000, 1,318 services were provided. Today, however, almost 55,000 patients have been waiting for procedures and certain diagnostic examinations, such as ultrasound of the heart, for an unacceptably long time.
There are two reasons why the tender did not succeed: poor preparation and poor timing of the tender. Namely, it turned out that the waiting lists on which the tender was based were inadequate or unrefined. As many as 39 percent of the people on it have already done the service, 29 percent did not want a new appointment with another contractor, and seven percent did not choose another contractor because their current date of the service was relatively close. A tenth, however, had appointments with new contractors. For 85 percent of professional patients, therefore, the new term offered was not appropriate, which meant that providers waited for patients who did not receive them.
In addition, the ministry published a tender in July, contractors were able to apply until the end of August, and implementation began in October. This coincided with a new epidemic wave, which halted the tender in mid-November. If the ministry had published the call a few months earlier, it could have started when the epidemiological situation in the country calms down. The ministry further explains that only the ordering of patients for health services within the tender was stopped in November. However, if the providers had open appointments and had patients already booked, they were able to perform the service.
In the last two years, the Health Inspectorate has carried out 462 inspections of waiting lists in health care and imposed a total of 366 measures, of which 208 administrative measures and 158 misdemeanor measures. Most of the time, they performed inspections only on the basis of an application, and since March this year, they have been conducting regular inspections again.
And although the Ministry of Health announced at the end of October last year that it would publish a new tender for shortening queues by the end of November, based on realistic consolidated waiting lists, it has not yet been published. As they say, the tender is being prepared, and the exact timeline of the announcement is not yet known.
As part of the call for shortening queues, health services are covered from funds that remained in the accounts of supplementary health insurance companies in 2020 and 2021 due to a less completed program in hospitals. According to the latest data, these funds amounted to around 60 million euros, and last year's reports from insurance companies are not yet available. So far, 827,000 euros have been spent on this. Insurance companies guarantee that unspent funds will be used for health care, regardless of whether they will be used by the end of the year in accordance with the law.
So how much have queues been shortened due to the public tender? Nothing. They have even lengthened, mainly due to the limited provision of services during the epidemic. The Ministry of Health predicts that the queues will be extended until the end of this year, as well as next year.
A good million fewer visits from patients to family doctors per year
During the epidemic, however, it was not only the availability of operations that decreased; patients found it much more difficult to find their personal physician. For example, ZZZS data show that personal physicians and family physicians performed more than 1.2 million fewer examinations of sick patients in their dispensaries in 2020 than in the previous year, and last year this number further decreased.
The number of preventive examinations has also decreased, while the number of remote consultations has increased by almost 900 percent from 2019 to 2020, and by another 400 percent from 2020 to 2021.
In 2020, the number of gynecologist visits also decreased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 50,000 visits - but the situation improved last year and is almost reaching the pre-epidemic year.
During this time, doctors also issued significantly fewer referrals for specialist treatment or surgery. While 4.2 million referrals were issued in 2019, 3.4 million were issued a year later, almost 760,000 fewer referrals. And although more patients were referred last year, the level from three years ago has not yet been reached.

At the same time, it is not a negligible fact that around 130,000 people in the public health network do not have a selected personal doctor, without a selected gynecologist, about a quarter or 200,000 women and girls over the age of 13. A quarter of the population is also without a dentist of their choice. This cannot be entirely attributed to the lack of doctors, as - at least according to the list published on the HIIS website - almost 300 personal doctors and 170 gynecologists are still accepting new patients, and many patients are being admitted by many dentists within the public network.
Consequences: Less cancer and heart complications? No, it will only be discovered and treated later
Less access to GPs, less referrals and, last but not least, fear of infection, which has delayed patients' visits, are already reflected in fewer diagnoses, which are often made later than before the epidemic.
In the first wave of the 2020 epidemic, the number of referrals for oncology treatment in the country dropped significantly, fewer referrals were issued and fewer diagnoses were made. The most pronounced decline was in April 2020, when as many as a third fewer cancer diagnoses were made than usual. Although the situation improved in the following epidemic waves, about 10 percent less cancer was still detected at the time of the epidemic. The numbers vary according to the type of cancer, with particularly large declines in the number of new cases in skin cancer, prostate cancer and blood cancer.
Oncology in Slovenia was one of the exceptions among health care activities, as it had to be carried out smoothly, regardless of various restrictive measures. Nevertheless, various broader societal changes have indirectly affected the use and accessibility of health services. During the first wave of the epidemic, only the DORA, ZORA and Svit cancer screening programs were suspended. They were not stopped in the aftermath of the epidemic, they only adjusted their implementation.
""But there are no fewer cancer patients, we will only find them later,"" warns Vesna Zadnik, head of epidemiology and cancer registry at the Ljubljana Oncology Institute. Doctors at the Ljubljana Oncology Institute are already observing in clinical practice that patients with cancer in higher stages who have a worse prognosis are coming to treatment. But the long-term impact of the epidemic on the burden of cancer, such as patient survival or the distribution of stages at diagnosis, can only be realistically evaluated in the long term, when it remains to be seen how quickly they can catch up.
Initially, the fear of infection and then the reduced availability of personal physicians are the main reasons why the health of many cardiovascular patients has deteriorated, says Zlatko Fras, expert director of the internal clinic of the University Medical Center (UKC) Ljubljana. During the entire epidemic, the internal clinic treated about a tenth less patients than usual. The biggest dropout was in the first wave, when a third fewer patients were also recorded, as people simply delayed seeking help for fear of infection. ""It wasn't a time when people wouldn't get sick, but they didn't come to the doctor for acute treatment."" But later, these chronic patients came to internist first aid due to severe deterioration as they waited too long at home. At the internal medicine emergency room, the number of visits increased by as much as 20 percent.
And treating more serious complications is significantly more difficult and time-consuming than treating a milder health condition, Fras warns. In the continuation of the epidemic, the health status of many patients was also affected by the reduced availability of personal physicians. The patients thus remained at home despite the complications, and when they were completely weakened, they were rushed to the hospital. ""Although I have no empirical evidence to support this, the mortality of these patients due to reduced access to health care is likely to have increased and their life expectancy to be shortened."" In the long run, therefore, the epidemic will worsen the health of many cardiac patients, both due to reduced access to health services and the impact of covida-19 on these patients.
Nearly 90,000 patients today are waiting an unacceptably long time for an examination or surgery
If we believe the data on the number of people waiting at the NIJZ - they themselves point out that the data may differ from the real situation, as hospitals or. healthcare providers do not report up-to-date data on waiting times to the central system - today 5,000 more people are waiting for healthcare than before the epidemic, despite a total of almost 930,000 fewer referrals issued in two years.
However, in the last two years, the number of those waiting unacceptably long has increased by a fifth. While at the beginning of February 2020, just under 74,000 patients waited an unacceptably long time for the first examination and services, today almost 90,000 are already waiting.
The number of those who wait unacceptably long has doubled, but they should be treated very quickly due to their health condition, ie within 14 days. Today, almost 13,000 people in the country are inadmissibly waiting for a referral check-up very quickly, a good 38,500 with a referral fast and more than 38,300 with a referral regularly.
In 2020, 58,000 fewer treatments were performed in hospitals than in 2019, and patients spent a total of 400,000 fewer days in hospitals than the year before. The epidemic also affected the implementation of health care programs last year, but less than the year before.
The wait for the first examination by a specialist has also been extended. Meanwhile, before the epidemic, for example, patients waited an average of 40.6 days for their first cardiac examination, but had a referral with a degree of urgency very quickly, which should allow them to be examined within 14 days; They are waiting for the first examination at a neurologist today with a referral very quickly for almost three months, the length of the wait has doubled compared to two years earlier. Even worse, she was taken away by patients with a referral on a regular basis. The average examination for a rheumatologist is less than two years, and for a neurologist nine months."

He and his colleagues noted that only in the field of children and adolescents did the situation worsen - in the field of anxiety, depression and eating disorders, they also recorded an increase of about 40%, and the presence of suicidal thoughts in adolescents increased sharply.
The pressure on patients was so severe that they had to drastically reduce bed rest, which of course means harm to the patient, and patients found it harder to reach a specialist outside the hospital, which sent many straight into the arms of gurus - inadequately educated, self-proclaimed therapists. services are mostly offered through social networks.
At the end of the month, almost immediately before the elections, the government then adopted an action plan for 2022 and 2023 to implement the resolution on the national mental health program 2018-2028.
It focuses on the mental health of children and adolescents aged 14 to 25 - Health Minister Janez Poklukar explained that 50 percent of mental disorders and distress occur in children under 14 and 75 percent under 25.
Funds in the amount of 31 million euros have been earmarked for the action plan, but staffing is an even bigger problem than the money itself.
The field of mental health is so far from orderly in our country. We therefore asked the political parties how to solve the biggest dilemmas in the field of mental health, in what time period they would regulate the field of psychological care providers, how and in what time to provide adequate staff for mental health centers, as well as how to address the challenge. the harmful effects of modern technology on the mental health of young people?
Many cite mental health centers as a solution, but it is worth noting that they are facing severe staff shortages.
Freedom Movement: The area of ​​psychological care providers needs to be prioritized
The Freedom Movement says mental disorders are one of the major public health problems. ""Priority must be given to the optimal implementation of the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program, which is valid for the period up to 2028.""
They also announce that, in accordance with their general guidelines regarding the implementation of the decisions of the Constitutional Court, they will immediately amend the Mental Health Act accordingly.
""We will establish professional supervision of mental health service providers. We will ensure better supervision of psychotherapeutic service providers and consider stricter licensing conditions following the example of other Western countries, such as Austria, France or Germany. Psychotherapeutic and psychosocial counseling activities should be professionalized accordingly. with the medical paradigm and taking into account the concept of integrative medicine, ""they promise and say that the field of psychological care providers needs to be prioritized, as the epidemic in this area leaves the most negative consequences, with special emphasis on children and adolescents.
""We will organize a network of mental health centers where the general population will have easier access to psychiatric specialists, clinical psychologists, licensed psychotherapists and psychosocial counselors. The goal of the network is to significantly reduce inequalities in regional access to mental health care, especially for vulnerable groups such as children and adolescents. and the elderly, ”they promise. Many such centers are already operating, but the problem is staffing, experts warn.
""Among the opportunities, we also see the involvement of specialists in psychiatry and clinical psychology to solve mental disorders in adolescents and young adults,"" the Svoboda Movement is considering solutions. ""We will train additional medical staff and raise awareness among young people about the importance of mental health. We will introduce psychological counseling for psychology students in colleges under the appropriate supervision of mentors,"" they added.
""It is necessary to provide systematic funding for specializations in clinical psychology and provide funding for at least 30 specialists a year. To this end, we will eliminate queues at psychologists, clinical psychologists and child psychiatrists as soon as possible and provide additional specializations for these professions,"" they promise.
What about the harmful effects of modern technology? ""They need to be neutralized through quality programs and a wide-ranging public network of mental health services and services, which is national capital and as such must undoubtedly be strengthened.""
Left: The issue of mental health is not exclusively related to the health system, but it is also a question of what kind of society we want to live in
""According to all data, the situation in the field of mental health was catastrophic even before the coronavirus epidemic,"" the Left warns. Studies by the National Institute of Public Health found that the existing public health network was not in line with the actual mental health needs of children and adolescents before the epidemic: ""Between the seven years between 2008 and 2015, Children and adolescents due to mental and behavioral disorders at the secondary level increased by a horrific 71 percent. Epidemic and restrictive measures only worsened the situation. . ""
""A concrete plan in this area needs to be drawn up on the basis of the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program adopted in 2018, which has not been done so far or has been done to a limited extent. for mental health did not start operating until July 2021, three years after the adoption of the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program? ""
According to the Left, the field of mental health needs to be comprehensively regulated within the public system: ""The accessibility of public providers needs to be increased and more attention paid to prevention programs and activities. it is clear that special efforts need to be made in the call for applications and to offer incentives for this type of employment. ""
They also see at least part of the solution in prevention: ""As in health in general, prevention is crucial in mental health. The Left program offers clear and decisive answers in this regard. Precarious employment relationships, unresolved housing issues, working beyond working hours and the fact that employees are available practically all the time has a strong impact on people's mental health. Thus, the issue of mental health is not only linked to the health system, but also to the kind of society we want to live in. ""
As they point out, they are aware of the harmful effects of modern technology: technology should serve the needs of people, not show wealth and other differences among the youngest, and that the formation of personality and the growth of the individual is linked to the pressures they experience on private social networks aimed solely at making a profit. recognize the impact of different types of platforms on the mental health of children and adolescents and, more broadly, on public (mental) health and regulate their activities in accordance with the public interest. ""
LMŠ: Establishment of a mental health service or directorate within the Ministry of Health The LMŠ warns that the negative effects of the epidemic on mental health will remain after it has passed: ""Data and statistics from the United Nations and the World Economic Forum show more than 200 people have died from the virus due to various forms of mental disorders (pre-existing mental patients are not included in the statistics). additional burdens on the mental health care system, which was already severely malnourished in Slovenia before the outbreak. ""
According to them, in order to improve the situation in the field of mental health care for the population, a series of urgent measures in the field of economic, social, educational and health policy must be implemented, but they must act in a coordinated manner. According to them, the needs in the field of mental health should be considered a priority, all the more so due to the crisis situation, and systemic financing of mental health should be provided, and the field of mental health care for Health, to ensure the functioning of the Government Council for Mental Health in the optimal professional and decision-making composition.
NSi: Raising parental awareness is important
NSi highlights the work of the current government in this area: ""In 2018, the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program 2018-2028 or the Peace Program was adopted, and a proposal for an action plan for 2022 and 2023 is currently in the final stages. In 2021, the establishment of mental health centers for children and adolescents, which operate at the primary level of health care, has been accelerated to 16, and four are still in full swing. In this term of office, we have started to address this at an accelerated pace and provide funding for an additional 30 specializations of clinical psychologists. ""
However, they believe that prevention programs or psychosocial support programs, parenting programs and programs that deal with particularly vulnerable children and families are very important to strengthen their resilience: ""Programs must be available in schools, health care facilities and local communities Working with families is crucial, as almost half of the mental illnesses or disorders present in adulthood first appear before the age of fourteen. ""
In the field of modern technologies, it is important to raise awareness of parents: ""To be aware of their pitfalls and dangers, and work with children in schools in a way that on the one hand learn useful and safe uses of technology, and on the other teachers they are also aware of the dangers. ""
Let's connect Slovenia: Support in a familiar environment is crucial
Let's connect Slovenia emphasizes the construction of social inclusion systems at the local level, through which we would increase the sense of security and inclusion, they say: ""We believe that in prevention and prevention of consequences, support at home or in a familiar environment is crucial.""
""We also support the good practices of pilot projects of comprehensive mental care at home, which has been taking place in Primorska in recent years, as it shows excellent results,"" they state. ""Our goal in the next term is to establish a system that will transfer this comprehensive field approach to the whole of Slovenia. Namely, many mental distresses remain unanswered due to the distance of people from the centers and care.""
Modern technologies are a part of our lives, but they are becoming an increasing factor influencing the mental health of young people, he said: ""It is crucial that we deal with prevention, which means spending time in connection with modern technology and the like. ""
SAB: Children would hand in their mobile devices before the start of the lesson and take it back after the end of the lesson
""At SAB, we believe that there is an urgent need to strengthen mental health activities by promoting positive factors as a prevention against factors that negatively affect mental health. An individual's lifestyle has changed dramatically in recent years, becoming faster and more stressful. The amount of stress in the last two years has also been strongly influenced by the epidemic and its consequences - both in the health field and elsewhere - in the workplace, schools, ""the SAB estimates.
As one of the solutions to this problem, they see awareness of the importance of mental health in the workplace and schools - detabuzing the problem of mental health - as well as organizing free workshops (both prevention and treatment) and psychological counseling for individuals: "" patients have previously been in line for counseling. Mental health is inextricably linked to physical health and, consequently, to the well-being, functioning and productivity of the individual. ""
They also estimate that modern technology has strongly influenced the lives of adolescents and children, especially during the epidemic, when they were practically constantly in front of electronic devices: ""In the SAB, we believe that and high schools could have a positive effect on their well-being. Children would hand over their mobile devices before the start of class and take it back after school. ""
SD: Expanding the basket of compulsory health insurance rights
""While more than five million people have died in the world due to the covida-19 epidemic, every seventh person suffers from mental distress,"" the SD notes. Due to severe staff malnutrition and unacceptably long queues, many in the field of mental health are announcing the following measures in our country:
- Regulation of mental health legislation
""This includes the amendment of the Mental Health Act, which is deficient and outdated, as well as the drafting of two new laws: the Psychotherapy Act and the Psychological Activity Act. Legislation regulation is a necessary basis for addressing accessibility, staff malnutrition and quality of care.""
- Make professional assistance accessible to all
""Establishment of additional mental health centers throughout Slovenia (for children and adolescents as well as for adults), which will be geographically evenly distributed according to the needs of the population.""
- Expanding the basket of compulsory health insurance rights
""In the field of mental health, we want to ensure more rights under health insurance by placing psychotherapy in the set of rights, which is crucial for the effective and long-term treatment of certain mental distresses and disorders.""
- Upgrading the personnel network
""Based on the in-depth analysis of population needs and the Action Plan 2022-2023 of the National Mental Health Program 2018-2028, quotas will be prepared to increase the number of specializations in psychiatry, child psychiatry and clinical psychology. In addition, we will strive to provide treatment, in particular in the field of mental health of the elderly, children and adolescents. ""
- Strengthening preventive and promotional activities
""Preventive measures can prevent the development or deepening of mental distress and disorders and thus raise the quality of life of people in the long run. Therefore, it is important that the field of mental health is included in education at all levels of the education system. in the field of raising mental health literacy and supporting activities aimed at reducing the stigma of mental health. ""
They promise that if they are among the parties that will make up the government, they and their coalition partners will address the preparation of a concrete plan immediately upon the new government and prepare the necessary legislation in the field of mental health in the first half. ""However, as resolving the staff shortage is a long process, due to the long duration of specializations, we will announce at least 30 additional specializations in clinical psychology as a priority when the new government takes office.""
When it comes to the negative effects of technology on the mental health of young people, they suggest the following solutions:
- Implementation of parent education for the healthy use of digital screens of children and adolescents
- Educating children and young people about the healthy use of digital screens and strengthening the development of healthy habits (eg sleep hygiene, physical activity, socializing with friends without the use of digital screens)
- Promoting the healthy use of digital displays
- Strengthening sources of help for people facing problematic use of digital screens or even addiction

The SDS highlights the government's achievements in the field of mental health
The SDS also points out that in December 2017 the National Assembly adopted the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program 2018-2028, the basic goal of which is to transfer the focus of mental disorders from the secondary to the primary health level to the domestic environment: ""The first ten centers for mental health of children and adolescents, three centers for diagnostics and emergency treatment of children and adolescents have been established (at the Pediatric Clinic of the University Medical Center Ljubljana, the Department of Child Psychiatry at the University Medical Center Maribor and the University Psychiatric Clinic Ljubljana). The Government of Janez Janša provided funds for an additional ten beds for children and adolescents at the Center for Mental Health of the University Psychiatric Clinic in Ljubljana. € 1.5 million annually.These teams are zago for the Piran, Domžale, Maribor and Sevnica health centers. ""
However, as they point out, they are aware that the shortage of staff in this area is one of the major problems and challenges: "" Thus, this year the budget of the Republic of Slovenia provides funds for 10 specializations in clinical psychology, and in the next two years an additional 20. The Ministry of Health has also prepared an action plan for the national mental health program for the period 2021-2023. Awareness of the serious situation in the field of mental health signed a decision on the appointment of a working group on mental health on 1 April 2022. The group includes 23 experts (from doctors, the Ombudsman and the judiciary to NGOs). On 31 March 2022, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Action Plan for 2022 and 2023 for the implementation of the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program 2018-2028. Special attention is paid to young people and includes goals for reducing suicide and alcohol-related mental disorders, tasks for strengthening knowledge and competencies in the field of mental health, for the implementation of social and family support programs and goals for activities and programs to establish support environment in educational, institutions, institutions and local communities.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/zelimo-se-pogovarjati-z-vsemi-strankami-ki-bodo-v-parlamentu-niso-pa-v-danasnji-vladi.html,'We want to talk to all the parties that will be in parliament but not in today's government',"The president of the Svoboda Movement, Robert Golob, is convinced that his party will win the elections and nominate a candidate for the government, which he says will most likely be his own. He completely rejects the legacy of the current government. So how does he explain that he took two deputies into his ranks to help appoint her? What will be his ethical standards in politics, how would he navigate with coalition partners and how will he address challenges such as healthcare, the public sector wage system and the creation of higher value-added jobs?","You are not a complete newcomer to the Slovenian political scene, but you are still perceived as a new face who appeared during this election. The last few elections have taken place in our country with the appearance of a new face. What will be different this time?
I think that the appearance of new faces can also be a reaction of people to the fact that they are not satisfied with the existing party offer. But why do I believe that we can offer freshness that will not be short-lived, but will lead to radical and structural changes in this country? Because we are trying to capture a sufficiently wide range of different people who actually have experience from different social subsystems. I myself have experience not only from the economy, but also from knowledge of state and local politics. At the same time, we are not contaminated, marked by past decisions of state policy. That is to say, we are coming people who know how politics works, but we have not yet tested ourselves in it and we are not prisoners of past mistakes. And it seems to me that being able to come with an unburdened view is the best guarantee that we will actually try to introduce new things. We will not, as you say, be a new face, above all we will be a new politician.
But your client was formed in express time. Is it possible to get to know your candidates so well in such a short time that you can vouch for them?
We humans change our whole lives. Even some you know surprise you after ten years. We tried to get to know the candidates as well as possible, we introduced a system where we had three candidates for each candidate position. We weren’t looking for one, but we had three, which we decided on not only based on which one made the best impression and which one wasn’t unmarked in the past, but also based on how they can work together. So we were looking for a wide enough set, diverse people who form a functioning whole. Of course. If we had another month, two or three, we could get even better results, but on the other hand, it is necessary to draw the line once and make a decision. So I'm satisfied.
But I am even more pleased with what you will see after the election, that is, with the executive team. For in this process, we have not only dealt with the selection of candidates for parliament. In fact, we once again have so many people willing to take on the executive function.
Miro Cerar spoke similarly in 2014, but then we saw what was happening to his client, what followed the violent rise. He stepped down two years ago, saying it was no longer his client. Do you have such fears?
I come from the economy. And when I involuntarily left the economy after fifteen years, I said it was still my business. Gen-I is still my business after fifteen years - I feel like it’s mine at heart - I’m not its owner and never will be. And that may be the difference. Gen-I grew from four employees in 2002 to 600 employees. When you know how to build a team and identify with it, something like this cannot happen to you.
However, you accepted, for example, Janja Sluga and Jurij Lep, who helped to form the current government. Why did you decide to do this, what is the message of this?
They were not the only ones to set up this government, but they were the first to say no to this government. And that was the key criterion. I understand that a person also makes a mistake in life. He who knows how to admit a mistake as soon as possible, accept responsibility for it and then take the other side and start correcting it, has great value in my eyes as a human being. Namely, many people prefer not to admit a mistake, just so that it doesn't turn out, than if they made it. And these are, in fact, the people who keep this government alive today. Not those who admitted the mistake, but those who still persist in it. They are even trying to get into politics again, under new names and disguises.
But because of that, Ivan Gale supposedly gave up on you. Are you sorry about that?
That ""supposedly"" is just in place. Mr. Gale had an open door to our party, he could choose anything and make any request. He made no demands, but decided as he did, without explaining why. Explaining that it was the fault of MP Janja Sluga, he started giving later when you started asking him why he did not join us. When I asked him this myself, I didn’t get an answer.
Where did Igor Zorčič get lost in this story?
See the STA example. There is an important distinction as to who fought against the government of Janez Janša and then resigned. And here is the distinction between the two. I wouldn't go deeper, but you always have to draw a line somewhere and we drew it between Janja Sluga and Igor Zorčič.
In the case of STA?
For example.
Was it part of the calculation that you came to confrontations with two deputies on RTV?
Ofcourse not. It just so happened now. By the way, other Members also offered themselves to us. We could have five or more Members today. However, we did not want to break up any of the KUL parties and we did not want to receive the deputies who ended up today in the party you have already mentioned, in the company of Ivan Galet. I want to say that we were selective. We rejected those that we judged did not fit our team the best. That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with them, but we’ve put together a team that we count on to be cohesive and not each of them individually pulling to their side.
So who exactly did you reject?
I hinted, but not about names. When politics becomes nominal, and this is unfortunately too common in Slovenia, then it is no longer politics, but interpersonal relations, reckonings and resentments. I think politics is more than that we all have to go through these personal stories and deal with what is good for the country and the people, not with individuals by name and surname.
Recent polls suggest that the LMŠ and SAB parties will fight to enter parliament. Are you worried about that? If one of the KUL parties drops out of parliament, will coalition negotiations probably be more difficult?
We are all fighting to enter parliament, not just them. But I certainly very much want to be able to form a stable and strong government after the elections. It is in our interest that as many KUL parties as possible, ie from the center-left, come to parliament. This is our common interest. Voters, however, decide as they choose, we can’t influence that much. Some who may vote for us may have voted for one of the KUL parties in the past. Many will decide on the last day. I do know, however, that most of our voters are those who may have been undecided in the past, or were voters of parties that are no longer really on the scene today. Therefore, I am convinced that it is the Freedom Movement that will enable the center-left government to be stable and strong. For if Freedom had not emerged, these voices would probably have remained at home or scattered across the spectrum, and we would again have a relationship similar to the one we have in Parliament today. Somehow half-and-half between the ruling party and the opposition.
I reckon that by attracting the undecided, who have been saturated with the policies of both, we will be able to form a stable government. I really believe in that.
So 60 seats or more?
Of course, if we look at the polls, it shows that the government itself would have a comfortable majority, somewhere between 53 and 56 MPs. Why am I talking about 60 myself? Because I want us to be able to at least programmatically form coalitions, perhaps project coalitions for individual cases, which will have a larger majority than the government itself. But who says it just has to be a relationship, whether you’re in or not? Let us remember the 1990s and the governments of Janez Drnovšek, who had very different statuses - project cooperation, program cooperation, associate members of the coalition. We have already seen all this in Slovenia and with respectful dialogue this is possible. But when we put ours-yours, which is the situation today, then it is only whether you are in government or not, but to govern in different ways and the interest of the people is that when we seek a broader consensus for a project, such as election system that we will then seek some broader support. Not just because we have to, but because it’s right.
So the KUL coalition is not the only one that is interesting to you. How interesting is it to you at all? You recently said that you will also be talking to clients specifically. Which one is closest to you and how far will you reach the right political pole in these conversations?
We have no agreement with KUL. We have refused to enter KUL and we are not talking about it. We see them as those who are closest to us in terms of values ​​and program orientations. We will certainly diverge somewhere else, but there are also differences between them. However, we want to talk to all the parties that will be in parliament but not in today's government. But who says that no new party will break through? People will decide who will be in parliament.
We may one day find some program or project collaboration with those in government, but time will tell.
I think it is crucial that the government draws a clear line and says - we have nothing to do with the legacy of the current government, no continuity and we will break it. Therefore, no one in today’s government can be in ours. What will he do? He will try to retain the privileges he has created for himself. It doesn't matter what it's called. Whether NSi, which does not staff, their staff is everywhere, or Specifically, which is honest, I do not know how many investigations… In short, it does not matter which of them promises to come to the next government and offer for it. They will not be in the next government, as this would allow our government to accept the legacy of this government, which we reject in its entirety.
So you do not exclude project cooperation with the parties of the current government?
Let’s say we have a project of an electoral system. Isn't it logical that the government will offer cooperation to parties that will not be in the government? We know in advance who will reject this. Nothing wrong, we won't miss them. But we know who is the one who is being offered today as a connecting link on projects.
So New Slovenia?
The one who will decide that way. Maybe the Slovenian National Party.
If we go back to KUL… There are speculations about the mandate. How do you see this embarrassment?
I don't see any embarrassment. Of course, the Freedom Movement will get the most votes, and of course the Freedom Movement will give a mandate, and I will most likely do it myself.
According to opinion polls, people today are very clearly determined. If there will be such relationships, then there will be no embarrassment for anyone.
What about post-election cooperation with some parties, such as the Left. You have the modernization of the Slovenian Army in your program, the Left predicts that this is the topic that will be the hardest nut to crack in any coalition negotiations. Are you ready for that and how much does Levica have to worry about being dropped from the talks because of her views?
I do not believe that the coalition would fall apart because of such things. After this experience we have in the last two years, when we are about to slip from autocracy to dictatorship, I think we have all learned, especially the current opposition, that some things need to be looked at more broadly, including choosing a lesser evil. . In this particular case, however, I do not see a point where the coalition would fall apart. Because I myself do not believe that increasing the cost of buying armored vehicles or aircraft is the right thing to do. The point is not in military spending, but in security spending. The army is not meant for itself. In some part, missions abroad, and primarily the security of our country. At this time, however, you are no longer building security through armored vehicles, which also do not benefit the Russians in Ukraine much. What is important for security are completely different systems. We have civil protection and rescue as an important part and cyber security as an even more important part. Then we have specialized weapons, such as drones. We have the best light aircraft manufacturer in the world, but we do not know how to connect this knowledge with the military industry. I want to say that Slovenia can offer a lot in the field of security, if we take the security issue as an investment in starting a specialized economy, which will also have its market niche within NATO, which is even desirable today, then we will kill three flies at once. the Left will also agree, because we will not endanger people with these weapons, on the contrary, we will increase security and create value for the country, and consequently we will have more money for social services.
Why did you decide to run in the same constituency as Luka Mesec?
Because according to our analyzes, there are three districts in Ljubljana where we can get the most votes, and we stuck to that. We had a choice of center and Šiška. In the end, I opted for two counties. Not to maximize my personal percentage, but the number of votes that the Freedom Movement will receive. Otherwise, there would be someone in every county.
There are only four presidents of KUL…
I told you we don't have an agreement with KUL. We didn’t put much effort into avoiding each other.
What about Zoran Janković? He came to support you at the convention, then we heard that you have nothing to do with Positive Slovenia. Can we understand this as if you understood that his support could harm you, especially outside Ljubljana?
Mayor Janković has done a lot for Ljubljana, no one can take that away from him. It is true, however, that when I appeared on the scene in November, he offered to take over Positive Slovenia. I didn’t want that and I don’t regret it because we wanted to put things anew. We didn’t want to be a part of the past, we wanted a new story with new perspectives. This is the political part.
Even later, when he himself asked if he could express his support for us, I said that as an individual and a mayor, he could always express his support. When we had the convention, we, as the mayor of the city where we had the convention, invited him in line with political etiquette and gave him the opportunity to publicly explain his support. We give the same opportunity to anyone who is willing to publicly support us. Anyone who will publicly support us without having a desire to return the favor in the background is welcome. However, we reject silent support from the background, which is always associated with counter-services. That he supported us in public seems to me to be the only real way we will not dream of uncles from the background. We want to have those who support us publicly known.
Let us remember the Congress of Positive Slovenia about a decade ago, when you said because of the events with the CCP that the Queen, Janković, must also be sacrificed. After that, the pharmacist affair happened. How did you meet again?
We didn't. That is exactly what I am talking about. I believe that Mayor Janković has recognized in our party an element that can have a positive impact on the political landscape in Slovenia. That's how I perceive it. It is true, however, that our history has had its ups and downs. But we always had an honest relationship and when I disagreed, I said it, even in public. There were two congresses and I shared my views on both. At the first congress, I suggested that, given that he and Janša were suspected of corruption risks, if we wanted to get rid of Janša's government, which was short-lived at the time, we had to decide whether we were willing to sacrifice our king, not the queen. When we decided at the next congress whether we would support the government of Alenka Bratušek, I supported the government.
We also once heard that you are a jumper on the chessboard because you like to jump uncontrollably left and right. Is this still the case? How should voters understand this?
That was ten years ago, when I wanted to say very clearly that I was independent within Positive Slovenia and that I was able to use moves that are in fact the least conventional. The straight jumper moves the least straight and the least conventional. This part of not thinking linearly still applies to me. And that’s exactly why I believe we can start solving most problems in a different way.
Today we are prisoners of history for the last 15, 20 years, when most governments take a very straightforward approach to all problems - from health, pensions, youth… We want to change this view, say, so it has been so far, but now we will start looking for new ways they will be innovative.
As one of the fundamental values, you emphasize respect, and you have written that you will establish cultural dialogue and normal, respectful and inclusive communication at all levels of society. How will you achieve this in a politically heated scene? The rift between right and left is extremely deep.
It needs to start elsewhere. I believe that the political scene is divided today. However, at the same time, I see that a respectful dialogue between parties that do not participate in government - and even with some of them is possible - is quite normal.
We talk respectfully with KUL, as well as with civil society. And if we are able to talk respectfully with ordinary people, this is the right foundation.
Before the elections, it is fashionable to emphasize how to connect with everyone. This is pure bluff. This is not respect, but lying. He who explains to you today that he would connect with everyone, of course on his own terms, is lying. We have clearly set the line for who we believe will stick to when they say something and will seek solutions in a respectful dialogue.
It is crucial, however, that we establish a respectful dialogue between people, because this division is spreading among people, and that is what is harmful. Not between clients, the problem is the division between people, between neighbors, co-workers, and we really want to fix this slowly, but above all with results and hard work.
Marjan Šarec met with Janez Janša four years before the elections. Are you? Would you?
It never crossed my mind!
When was the last time you talked?
I have seen Janez Janša once in the last ten years, last autumn at an event on the energy future. There were 40 of us and I imagined what Gen-I could contribute to Slovenia's energy future.
What about after the election? Will you talk?
I hope that we will meet in confrontations before the elections. And that's that.
The outgoing government has faced a number of scandals, but the ministers who were at the center of these developments have remained. But what would be your tolerance for mistakes, slips and irregularities? What does ethics in politics mean to you?
I will return to what we have already talked about. That everyone has the right that when he recognizes a mistake and sincerely apologizes, he gets another chance. But it depends on the mistake. Not all mistakes are the same. There is a line for mistakes as well. You can call it ethics or the rule of law. So there are mistakes that can be corrected, I believe that you do not progress without mistakes. But there are mistakes that are so big and important that it is necessary to say goodbye.
I have been dealing with all this for the last 15 years in the economy. I learned from my colleagues from my mistakes, and I said goodbye to some of them. I have no problem with that. A quick farewell when someone doesn’t belong on the team by values ​​is most effective. I can’t work with people with whom we fundamentally disagree that what we do is fair and right. I believe you will tell me that this is naive in politics. Okay, but we'll be a little naive at first. But it is through this that we will be able to introduce new standards. We will start with a culture of dialogue and I believe that through this we will be able to establish an ethic of action.
One more thing, I have never received a euro bribe in my life, I have zero tolerance for that.
But how much money will you spend on the election campaign, which is an expensive project. Who finances it?
Different. The funds we have in our account were selected exclusively through donations from individuals with first and last names. I myself was among the donors.
How much of that money will it be?
I didn’t look at the bill, but if I knew it was going to be a question, I would tell the exact figure. However, we estimate that the campaign will cost around 400,000 euros. The good news, not just for us, is that most bills always fall due after elections. And given that the polls show us very well, we can also time the use of funds according to the expected result. I have no worries from that point of view.
Aleš Hojs has revealed that they are expecting your income tax return on RTV. You will send it, why not? Did you have any income other than Gen-I?
No, I had no income. However, I was surprised when the Minister of the Interior first pointed out that he was looking forward to my income tax returns. At first I thought they were looking forward to it at the Police, where I would probably really send her again. However, when I found out that the RTV editorial board started requesting this information on the basis of his intervention, and then Minister Hojs said again that 'they' - in the first person plural - were expecting it, I thought it was horrible. How can the Minister of Police, together with the RTV editorial board, expect the personal data of a political competitor? And he talks about it in public. It is a police state. And therefore: for the sake of democracy and the rule of law, it does not occur to me to send my personal data to these police collaborators on RTV or the Minister of Police. However, I have nothing to hide and when the time comes, if necessary, I will publish it. However, I don't think it will be necessary, there is nothing that we haven't already published in several places, including your portal. But I don’t mean to play by their notes.
Gen-I will, as circulated in some media, respond to hints about paying journalists in recent years. How will he respond?
In fact, this is another story when, on the one hand, we are dealing with several televisions that receive money for their work from an unknown source from abroad, and they think that is fine. Television has leased ads on behalf of our client on Google. New 24TV. Then one of their satellites, whom I will not name for not advertising it, spins an alleged story about the financing of one of the independent portals, which is a big thorn in the side of the government and its president. I believe that Gen-I will respond in accordance with the legal deadline and legal obligations. What I know and can tell you on this topic is that neither the Freedom Movement nor Gen-I had anything to do with the mentioned portal this year. No contract or deal, no money spilled.
But what will be your contribution to media independence if you come to power? Will you be able to resist the temptation of the authorities to subjugate them?
Absolutely. Here our contribution will be greatest. I believe that the collective is as strong and as good as it accepts responsibilities and is empowered. Empowering the collective is the best way for the collective to fulfill its mission. There is no other way. In public television, this means empowering their collective. The program scheme, the program council - this must come from within, not from outside, and in the Freedom Movement we will not only support this, but we will insist that other coalition parties accept it as well. That they will be able to resist temptation.
You have announced that you will be giving away the Gen-I award for last year to some NGOs…
I've already done that.
But who are the recipients?
No one has received it yet, because the award is formally decided by the assembly by approving the annual report. It’s always the end of June and that’s when it will be officially known if the prize will be and how high it will be. And because I do not want anyone to speculate or influence this, I gave up this award in advance, in January, at the notary, whatever it may be. The amount will be transferred to humanitarian organizations.
Which one?
Nine. However, I will not talk about them until it is known what the amount is. I’d rather surprise them when they get it than embarrass them now unnecessarily. But you don’t have to speculate in political waters. Time will tell. None of them, however, know he is on the list.
You wrote two program documents, one election and one long-term. Some other parties already had an election program when your party was just starting its political path. Are these two documents something you are proud of? What is it in them that will bring Slovenia to a new level?
No country document is going anywhere. The document is just a guide. If I am proud of anything, I am proud of the people, including the people who prepared these two documents. Why two? The first is long-term, it talks about the vision of 2030 and what kind of society we want to become. In this document, we talk about being an open society, a free society and a socially just society that will be in solidarity with each other. But the election document is alive. External circumstances in the world are changing rapidly and to stand in time and say, this is my program that I will stick to for five years as I learned in business, it does not exist. You need to have a living document that brings you closer to the ideals you set for the next 10 years. The ideals are known, we are proud of them. However, we have a living document with which the team will manage the next steps on how we will achieve these goals.
There are three urgent points in the election document. The first is healthcare. We are not running away from this. This is not the point of one minister, but of a large team to be presented before the election, and also of the Prime Minister. The second point is climate action, which is also not a matter for one ministry, this point is also crucial if we want a community that will not destroy the planet, but will preserve it for its children. The third is solidarity between the generations. We're getting older. There will be more and more of us in retirement, there will be less and less natural increase of those who will meet our pension requirements according to the flow system. Therefore, it is first necessary to take care of young people so that they will feel respected and will be able to create a home in Slovenia. So that they will not flee abroad, but vice versa, that they will come to us from abroad. Then we will know that we will be able to take care of a safe and dignified old age. If we don’t take care of the young first, there will be nothing.
Unfortunately, the fact that we have full employment today, but we have not raised productivity and added value, will not help fill this gap. Low value-added jobs do not fill the gap, at most they increase it. The only way out of the vicious spiral is to raise added value. Those of us who come from the economy know this. Gen-I has 250,000 euros of added value per employee, while in Slovenia we have 40,000. Most jobs are between 20,000 and 30,000. With those jobs, we will never move into a 2030 vision that is globally competitive and socially just because we will not generate enough money.
Danijel Bešič Loredan is supposed to be the candidate for your Minister of Health, but who else will be in your medical team?
You have a confrontation on healthcare on your television on Monday, and I will say even more then, and the team will be presented at a roundtable on healthcare on 19 April.
How do you assess the work of the current Minister Janez Poklukar? Maybe you talked to him about collaborating?
No. We have not talked to anyone from this government about cooperation, we do not have that intention. I will not go into the assessment of him personally, but I will say something else. We were justifiably proud of our health. When you go abroad, to the US, you see how good healthcare we once had. However, over time, with covid, this has accelerated further, losing its reputation, power and accessibility. If we do not make radical changes and reverse the trend, we will be left without public health. Maybe it's someone's interest, mine certainly isn't. It’s mine to have strong public health, not to walk more every year.
Minister Poklukar announced that he would leave the proposal of the vaccination program for 2022 to his successor. Slovenia remained below 60 percent in vaccination. You say you are not in favor of compulsory vaccination. But would you support compulsory vaccination in individual groups? And how would you prepare for a possible new wave of new coronavirus?
Ever since the war in Ukraine started and the Prime Minister has been wandering around the eastern parts, covid-19 has miraculously disappeared from Slovenia. This is in its own right, as the situation in society has relaxed considerably. For if there was one reason we did not have high vaccinations, it is precisely this psychosis in the society that this government has established. There are analyzes that clearly show that anywhere in the world, the percentage of vaccinations is influenced by trust in government. If we have low vaccination coverage, it means complete distrust of government. What did the government do first when covid-19 was launched - in addition to masks and lost trucks? They beheaded the NIJZ. On the one hand, we have the incompetence of the government, and they have beheaded the supreme professional institution in this field, and they have given Jelko Kacin an explanation and confidence-building. The result is here. No opposition can do as much harm among the people as an incompetent government can.
However, it seems to me that we are all very lucky that the omicron strain has emerged. I hope the virus stays less deadly for the host. However, it is transmitted very quickly and none of the existing measures protect against infection. Not vaccinating with existing vaccines, nor wearing masks, at least not in the way ordinary people wear them. Therefore, to say that mandatory vaccination in the omicron strain would be useful, according to the assurances of the profession, premature, unprofessional… I do not believe in that either. If we compare ultra-vaccinated Israel and Denmark and low-vaccinated Slovenia, we see that data on infection first jumped in these two countries. Vaccination in Denmark did not prevent infections. I was vaccinated myself. However, I know of cases of people who have been vaccinated three times and have been infected with omicron twice already. Mandatory vaccination, therefore, as long as we are dealing with these strains, certainly not. If a new strain, a new disease, emerges, the profession will decide then.
The right hand of the Prime Minister is the Minister of Finance. Who would be yours?
We will reveal this after the election. We agreed not to talk about it.
So you already have it?
Yes.
In the public sector, expectations of the new government are very high. Also in financial terms. How will you navigate the relationship with them? What is your attitude towards the single pay system. And on the other hand - how to ensure higher wages and better conditions in the economy?
Why would a higher salary be something that comes naturally? I believe we all deserve higher wages. But we need to create higher value, government action must be primarily focused on creating higher value. Then it will be enough for everyone. Today, however, it is impossible to talk about the goal of higher wages in the public sector. However, a huge amount of injustice can be observed in the public sector within the existing system. And because of these injustices, we will soon establish what this government is not: social dialogue. We will respectfully meet with all the unions and discuss whether they want a single public pay system to remain. They must first decide on this. Then we will most likely get to the point where we find that the foundation can be common, and then things will have to be tackled separately by areas because the areas are so diverse. Today, by not distinguishing between areas, we are creating injustices. The most beautiful example is within healthcare, where we have total injustices between medical staff and doctors - and even among doctors by age. And if we don’t address them, we will never come up with a pay system that is fair. The current one is unfair to those who have the least. We will first eliminate injustices, create value in the meantime, and then we will be able to share the newly created value on a new basis. Only this path is right. It is immoral for me to want someone who is already privileged today, because he is well connected to the current government, to earn a little more for himself before the elections.
You are announcing a universal child allowance. What would be the amount of such an allowance and what financial effects on public finances are we talking about?
We must first ask ourselves what the purpose of this is. The intention is that no child should be hungry. And at the point where our kids are hungry at school, we’re not wondering about public finances. We need to make sure that this money is spent on purpose. Unfortunately, we have cases where child allowances today are not spent for the benefit of the child, but for other purposes. That needs to be fixed. Unfortunately, we still have cases where single mothers, the socially disadvantaged and even those who work, perhaps just above the ""minimum"", run out of time so that their children would not be hungry so that they would not catch a cold. This will be a child allowance. We need to take care of the children so that they have a safe and well-off youth, that is the duty of our society.
What about foreign policy? Where would you position yourself? What kind of relations would you build with Hungary, Russia and the current superpowers?
A distinction needs to be made between countries, nations, governments and the policies pursued by these governments. We also have a government in Slovenia that many people are not most proud of. So it is no wonder that we also agree a little less with any other government. I believe that it is necessary to have good relations with everyone, but I also believe that Slovenia is part of the European Union and that our commitment is primary. I am thinking, however, that we are part of a community, not a solo actor, not one that creates problems and provokes all the time, but one that cooperates creatively, respectfully and co-creates the EU.
However, foreign policy should be profiled in two other areas. The first is economic. Having economic attachés in countries where the economy is strong would be a necessity. On the other hand, we need to be actively involved in territorial cooperation. We used to have Alpe-Adria. In this area, too, we need to step up cooperation with our closest neighbors to make it easier to find some solutions within the geographical area - for example, how to achieve self-sufficiency at the nutritional level and how to achieve self-sufficiency at the energy level. Macro-regions are areas within which self-sufficiency can be achieved in areas where we cannot achieve it on our own.
For the end. How do you respond to the accusation that you went into politics when you lost your chair?
I will give you two answers. The first is material. The accusations at first were that I was left without a salary. I still have a salary that is not much lower than the one I had before. Even the prize is still allowed.
More important, however, is the following. Every man finds himself at a crossroads, he has certain anchors. My anchor was that I was responsible for the company I created and ran. It would be irresponsible on the part of any director to engage in running or campaigning for politics instead of running a business. And as long as I was in charge of the company, I avoided public appearances and engagements in politics. Which isn’t to say that I may not have been very well informed and connected in the background. That’s why the decision was so much easier.
But I figured there would be more of us. When I was a director, I was approached by different people, quite a few of them, and they all said, we will do something together. Then came November 15th and I figured I wouldn’t that they couldn’t ... In short, it was hard for everyone to expose themselves to what we see now, but not to me. Because I believe that there is only one thing that has always made us stand up for ourselves in history: that is, when they try to take away your dignity. This is not revenge. Freedom of society and the dignity of the individual are the goals that my ancestors fought for, I am proud of them, and I am fighting for them.

Among other things, he said when, if they got ""his"" government, all Slovenes would have a personal doctor and what his view of the president was, and he also revealed what an election outcome would mean for him.","You will be able to read the entire conversation with Robert Golob on our portal tomorrow.
1. If you win - when will all Slovenians have their own personal doctor?
I reckon we will be able to achieve this by the end of the term, for sure.

2. What kind of president is Borut Pahor?
Well-meaning, unfortunately not determined enough.

3. Who will be your party's presidential candidate?
We have no candidate.

4. Where would you go if you became prime minister, where would you go on your first visit?
In Nova Gorica. - And abroad? Probably to one of the neighboring countries, certainly not to Hungary.

5. Why didn't you give the previous prize?
Because I give this award for two reasons: firstly, because the situation among people has become so tense because of covid that I know that others need this award more than I do, and secondly, because I do not want this award to be the subject of political speculation. I want to have clear ground.

6. Is Tone Krkovič your Damir Črnčec?
No, Tone Krkovič is Tone Krkovič. Not in the party. I am in occasional contact with him. Nor does he intend to come to power.

7. Who else would you want in your ranks, but he remained unreachable?
There are many such people, but most have chosen to do so for personal reasons, so I will not name them.

8. What will be the failure of the election for you?
Failure would be in just one case: if the current government stays in power.

9. When will same-sex couples in Slovenia be able to adopt a child? Are you for it?
This has been resolved in a referendum in the past. I myself may be in favor of this story, but we need to check this again in a referendum. It needs to be prepared, the will of the people checked. And if the will of the people is like that, we will do it.

10. Would you go to Kyiv?
No, for several reasons. But that doesn’t mean it was entirely wrong. However, I do not see any strategic benefit from this, especially now that it has been revealed that it was a solo campaign."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/kako-bi-stranke-gospodarile-z-gozdovi-denar-od-lesa-za-pokojnine-posegi-v-sidg-blagovna-znamka.html,"How clients would manage forests: Money from wood for pensions, interventions in SiDG ...","Politics has agreed for some time that the forest is our great wealth, but practice says that our wealth is always a temptation. According to personnel changes, the battle for the state forest worth two billion euros is at the forefront of every government. But the quality of management could be discussed, the places of wood, which are measured in dozens of trucks, can be seen, but no one seems to notice them. What kind of forest management do the parties predict before the elections?","Before the elections, there are, of course, no promises of policy on prudent forest management and efficient use of funds from this title - the policy promises can be found below.
But before that, it is worth emphasizing how serious our problems are in this area, which we have already noted in a series of articles for the Facts section. For example, more than a thousand cubic meters of wood disappear from state forests every year. Most stolen wood from state-owned forests, which cover 12 percent of Slovenia's surface, was recorded in 2020, when as many as 100 full timber trucks were removed. For the most part, the perpetrators have to cut down the trees first and pull them out of the woods by truck. Therefore, the question is how such actions can go unnoticed. There are almost no judicial epilogues. Stolen wood from Slovenian forests also ends up in Austria and Italy.
At the same time, it is certainly interesting to note that in five years, as many as five directors have been at the helm of state forests.
WHAT DOES POLITICS PROMISE?
There is therefore no shortage of challenges in this area for the future. We asked the clients how they will regulate forest management, whether they think the state is a good owner of forests, and how they intend to solve the burning problem of importing wood from abroad and a large share of domestic ends in heating stoves.
Freedom movement: New reserves, connection of forest-timber production chain
The Svoboda Movement announces that they will promote sustainable, sustainable and multifunctional forest management and improve the operation of the company Slovenski državni gozdovi: ""We will support the establishment of new forest reserves and regional parks in Kočevski Rog, Kamnik-Savinja Alps and Pohorje. and more effective monitoring of the state of the environment and nature. We will change the Forest Act and the forest management strategy, thus ensuring greater control over the management of Slovenian forests. ""
They emphasize that most of the territory of our country is covered by forests, which means that we have a huge source of quality and affordable wood: ""Therefore, we consider the import of large quantities of wood from abroad completely unnecessary. , and thus the greatest possible added value of finished wood products, which we will achieve by establishing greater connections between the forest-timber production chain and companies in this field. ""
Left: Amendments to SiDG, ban on imports of crops produced by habitat destruction
In the Left, they are harsh towards the state-owned company SiDG, which has not developed capacity for management in state forests in the six years since its establishment ""and according to the latest available data (SiDG's annual report for 2020) 89 percent of production is transferred to private contractors"". ""So far, government strategies have limited the share of own production that SiDG can carry out in state forests to a maximum of 20 percent.
They add that SiDG has never seriously developed the capacity to establish entire forest-timber chains in Slovenia. ""In Levica, we intend to increase the share of own felling in the state company Slovenski državni gozdovi to more than 50 percent by 2025 with the goal of achieving 100 percent own felling by 2027. By strengthening forest infrastructure and incentives for domestic timber growers, we intend to prevent exports of wood and promote domestic production of quality finished products. ""
In the field of sustainable forest management, they intend to step up efforts to restore and care for forests: ""In order not to turn the forest into a source of CO2 due to natural disasters and too high goals of regular felling from the sink."" ""Although Slovenia has a relatively exemplary and sustainable forest management by importing certain types of feed, biofuels, rubber products and some meat products, we contribute to the felling of tropical rainforests. To protect them, we will advocate a ban on soybean imports. maize and other crops produced by destroying forests, wetlands, peatlands and other habitats, the conservation of which is crucial for climate change mitigation, in areas forcibly stolen by agro-industry from indigenous peoples and cultivated by completely disenfranchised workers and workers in (semi) slave working conditions, ""they add.
LMŠ: The goal is to create recognizable brands
The LMŠ emphasizes that wood is a natural resource of Slovenia, which - with proper management of its potential - should promote the development of the economy and society: ""In forest management, important links between state-owned enterprises and private owners. ""
Awareness of the quality of Slovenian wood should be strengthened and its sale promoted in various forms of so-called 'wood exchanges', and efforts should be made to export sawmill products as Slovenian brands and to maximize the added value of wood and wood products. with a higher level of processing (joinery, furniture, wooden construction and construction of residential and commercial buildings), based on innovative approaches and modern design and marketing, ""say the party of Marjan Šarc.
As they also point out, the program also has the following solutions:
- revision of the Forest Act for better forest management and administration;
- updating the national forest program;
- review of all applicable forest management plans and their compliance with the condition of forests affected by hail and the outbreak of lovers;
- modernization and effective implementation of the measures of the action plan for increasing the competitiveness of the forest-timber chain in Slovenia for the period until 2030;
- regulation of the wood assortment market, which will enable organized and uninterrupted supply of wood for the wood processing industry in Slovenia, with an emphasis on the involvement of private forest owners;
- increasing the mandatory share of domestic timber required in public construction contracts;
- creation of the Slovenian wood brand.
NSi: Increasing the consumption of Slovenian wood
The current practice shows that the state is not a good forest manager, they are clear in NSi, which is otherwise part of the current government, and they also include the Minister of Agriculture Jože Podgoršek. ""Control over felling and sales is poor. We must encourage the development of wood processing, especially the establishment of sawmills and the production of glued wood. We must increase the use of wood in Slovenian construction and industry.""
Let's connect Slovenia: Domestic biomass must become a priority in heating public buildings
Wood is one of the two key natural raw materials, but unfortunately we are behaving irresponsibly and its potential is not being sufficiently exploited, according to Connect Slovenia: ""The state must accelerate the development of wood processing with subsidies and development funds Domestic biomass (dry distillation, not incineration) must become a priority in heating public buildings, followed by Eco Fund policy. ""
""With an appropriate tax policy, we will also encourage the use of wood as a strategic Slovenian raw material for cheaper construction and consequently lower purchase prices and more environmentally friendly construction,"" they promise, adding that state forests should be of strategic importance to the country. .
SAB: Funds from the sale of wood and water must be directed to the Demographic Fund
The SAB also estimates that there is still a lot of room for maneuver in forest management and the possibility of improvement: ""We are convinced that control in Slovenian forests needs to be improved, and we are announcing an amendment to the Forest Act to regulate this. the possibility for the state-owned company SiDG to carry out all forestry work and purchase of wood in private forests ""
SAB also recognizes the issue of the connection between the forest-timber production chain and companies, which needs to be strengthened. Due to the excessive organizational division of forestry and timber production, the production of wood, primary products and timber products is fragmented and inefficient. SAB will ensure a regular long-term supply of logs from all Slovenian forests, which must enable the highest possible processing of wood in Slovenia, to the highest possible level. ""We will also place great emphasis on detecting illegal timber traders or resellers and unfair competition. We will also focus on preventing significant fluctuations in timber prices,"" they announced.
""Funds from the sale of wood and water must be directed to the demographic fund and used for pensions. Some have oil, we have water and wood, so we must allocate funds from the exploitation of these goods today for the future,"" they suggest.
SD: Overgrown agricultural areas need to be re-arranged for agricultural use or converted into quality forest stands
SD says it will continue its active development policy to revive the wood industry and economy: ""We will establish wood as a recognizable and high-quality Slovenian product. Overgrown agricultural land represents untapped potential. These areas must be re-arranged for agricultural use or converted into quality forest stands. ""
They believe that the state can be a good owner of forests: ""But the quality of state governance depends on strengthening the forest-timber chain by involving local, domestic wood producers, which provides higher added value of wood. In this context, cooperation with professionals is crucial. ensure this by setting up wood processing centers and providing access to services in state forests to timber growers (rather than timber traders). ""
SDS: Wood is not primarily an energy source, but a material for industrial processing
Wood is primarily recognized as a material for industrial processing, and not as an energy source, but the SDS emphasizes: ""Only wood that is not suitable for further industrial processing and used wood is used as an energy source.""
Responsible forest management is also important for improving the conservation of biodiversity, they continue: ""Our goal is to develop in particular the processing of round wood into semi-finished and higher value-added products; wood as a building material should be used especially in construction and furnishing CO2); shift to timber construction through public procurement; promoting the development of the furniture industry with an emphasis on modern and recognizable design solutions; promotional activities to increase the use of wood, especially among young people, the public sector and the general public.

After the district commissions informed the National Electoral Commission that doctors in some health centers were rejecting applications for certificates to voters who wanted to apply for voting at home due to illness, the DVK wrote in a letter that this was unacceptable. as the number of applications is not unmanageable and should not represent a major additional burden for doctors.","""According to the Ministry of Health, such a decision of the DVK does not have an appropriate legal basis. Therefore, the Ministry calls on the DVK to reconsider the decision according to which doctors should issue medical certificates, which will allow voters who will not be able to go to the polls The Medical Chamber of Slovenia is convinced that the National Electoral Commission must suspend the implementation of such a decision, ""the Medical Chamber said.
The decision of the National Electoral Commission states: ""Pursuant to Article 83 of the ZVDZ, voters who are unable to appear in person at the polling station where they are entered in the electoral roll may vote in front of the electoral committee at their home, provided they attach a notice appropriate medical certificate.

""With the unchanged legislation, there is no reason for such certificates to be needed this time. The current legislation does not mean that a voter should enclose an appropriate medical certificate when submitting an application for voting at home,"" the Chamber of Physicians said.
""The Chamber also points out that neither the decision of the DVK nor the legislation (Article 83 of the ZVDZ) shows the criteria on the basis of which a doctor would decide to issue such a certificate, for example whether such a certificate could be obtained by a voter. with a milder illness or the issuance of such certificates would be reserved only for persons with more severe acute illnesses. The opinion of the ZZS was also supported by the Ministry of Health, ""they added.
""The Association of Family Physicians at the Slovenian Medical Association also decided on the decision of the National Electoral Commission with the decision that family doctors will not issue such certificates.

Jerajeva je poudarila, da zagovarjajo pozitivno družinsko politiko, menijo pa tudi, da bi morali socialno politiko ločiti od družinske in z ukrepi pomagati mladim. ""Sprejeli smo zakon o jamstveni shemi,"" pa je med drugim dejala o ukrepih aktualne vlade. Naštela je tudi nekatere druge: ""V zadnjih dveh letih smo povečali tako otroške dodatke kot sredstva za novorojence, družine, starše smo razbremenili s spremembo zakona o dohodnini, smo pa želeli uvesti tudi socialno kapico, a še ni bilo dovolj podpore."" V SDS sicer ne nasprotujejo zasebnim pobudam na področju šol in vrtcev: ""Če želi nekdo svojega otroka vzgajati po nekih drugih vrednotah, mu moramo to omogočiti, to piše tudi v ustavi.""
Klakočar Zupančičeva je uvodoma dejala, da imamo v Sloveniji z ustavo zagotovljeno svobodno odločanje o rojstvu otrok, kar je prav tako ""pomembno pri tem, kako mladi načrtujejo družino"". ""Smo za to, da se mlade spodbuja, da imajo otroke, in sicer z aktivno politiko zaposlovanja, z dobro stanovanjsko politiko, da tudi pomagamo pri morebitni neplodnosti z biomedicinsko pomočjo, da se zagotovi ustrezno socialno varstvo, predvsem pa da vrtci ostanejo na tako visoki ravni kot zdaj.""  Sicer pa je ocenila, da je po letih, ko je politika na področjih, povezanih z demografijo, počela premalo, čas, da se to spremeni: ""Zavzemamo se za univerzalni otroški dodatek, deset let po prvi zaposlitvi pa naj bo dohodnina za mlade nič."" Glede vrtcev pa je dejala, da želi spomniti na znan dogodek iz zasebnega vrtca pred nekaj leti: ""Javni vrtci so regulirani, pravilno zastavljeni, v zasebnih vrtcih pa se lahko dogajajo stvari, ki so se že dogajale, torej neprimerno ravnaje z otroki."" Na repliko, da za takšne dogodke niso imuni niti javni vrtci, pa je vztrajala, da je ""možnost za to je precej manjša kot v zasebnih vrtcih"". Se je pa po njenem mnenju med epidemijo z otroki ravnalo neprimerno: ""V vrtcih maske, ki so jih morali nositi majhni otroci.  Meni – pa nisem zdravnica – se zdi to neprimerno. Zaradi ravnanja z otroki med epidemijo so se pri marsikom pojavile duševne težave.""
Bregantova je poudarila, da je naloga države, da zagotovi razmere, v katerih bodo mladi z veseljem imeli otroke. ""Da ne bodo obremenjeni s prekarnostjo, da bodo ustrezno plačani. Mladi ne potrebujejo miloščine države, ampak ustrezne razmere, da lahko trdno stojijo na svojih nogah."" Pohvalila pa je delo vrtcev v Sloveniji, tudi na periferiji: ""Želimo si decentralizacije, tudi pametnih vasi, ki pa bodo tudi v dobro starostnikov. Imamo dobro podlago.""
Kljub dolgoletnim obljubam sicer ostaja dejstvo, da so plače prenizke, da mladi zapuščajo državo, da so vrtci, čeprav so za drugega in nadaljnje otroke brezplačni, še vedno dragi, vzgojiteljice pa plačane premalo …
""Zmoti me, da takrat, ko govorimo o mladih, o njih govorimo kot o neki zelo homogeni skupnosti,"" je dejala Hotova. Poudarja namreč, da gre za raznoliko skupnost, saj imajo eni boljša izhodišča kot drugi – tako pri plačilu v službi kot pri reševanju stanovanjskega problema. ""Država mora vsem nuditi enake možnosti."" Med prioritetami je izpostavila gradnjo najemnih stanovanj, odpravo prekarnega dela, ki je ""le korak od revščine"", dolgoročno se zavzemajo tudi za brezplačne vrtce. Nasprotujejo pa zasebnim vrtcem: ""Bojimo se, da kakršna koli privatizacija tega vodi v popolno razslojevanje družbe."" Prav tako se ni strinjala, da bi bili zasebni vrtci za lokalno skupnost cenejši, saj mora investitor takšnega vrtca marsikaj zagotoviti sam.
Plače v vrtcih in javno proti zasebnemu
V nadaljevanju so se dotaknili plač vzgojiteljic in pomočnic vzgojiteljic. Ta težava v mandatu aktualne vlade ni bila rešena, čeprav obstajajo primeri, ko z vsemi dodatki ni dosežena niti minimalna plača.
""V šolstvu ima marsikatera skupina zelo visoke plače, drži pa tudi, da so nekateri plačani premalo,"" je dejala Jerajeva, ki se ji zdi neprimerno, da plačni sistem javnega sektorja omogoča, da je nekdo pod minimalno plačo. ""Toda v dveh letih pri tej sestavi DZ in ko se je vlada morala ukvarjati z epidemijo, ni bilo časa, da bi se odprl plačilni sistem.""
Na izziv voditelja, da pa so se o plačah pogajali v zdravstvu, je dejala, da so bili najbolj obremenjeni: ""Lahko bi se nam sesul sistem, če ne bi ničesar storili.""
Za morebiten prihodnji mandat je napovedala urejanje razmerij v plačnem sistemu – da se mora to dogajati v mirnejšem mandatu.
Bregantova je dejala, da seveda ni nobenega dvoma, da so plače zaposlenih v vrtcih, ki delajo z najmlajšimi, pri 740 evrih in plače mladih zdravnikov pri 940 evrih prenizke. ""Naš javni plačni sistem ni več enoten. Ima takšne anomalije, da ne moremo govoriti, da je to urejeno. To je treba urediti."" Predlagala je pogajanja z vsemi deležniki: ""Zavzemamo se za meritokratsko nagrajevanje."" Izpostavila pa je, da pri vsem skupaj ne gre le za plačilo, ampak tudi za ureditev delovnih razmer.
Maša Kociper je dejala, da je aktualna vlada dialog vodila le z nekaterimi skupinami. ""Vsi se zavedamo, da bo treba na neki točki, ne glede na to, katera vlada bo, ta plačni sistem prevetriti, tako da bodo neka nova razmerja."" Strinjala se je, da so vzgojiteljice plačane premalo: ""Ampak neka resna, odgovorna vlada se vedno vpraša, od kod denar."" Zato nasprotujejo zasebnim šolam in vrtcem, ""kot jih razume desna vlada"": ""Pri nas šole in vrtce razumejo tako, da zasebni vrtec in šolo stoodstotno plača država, posameznik se pa samo odloči, da bo tam neka druga ponudba vzgoje ali varovanja."" V SAB so sicer podprli pobudo občin, ki so želele, da bi občina, če ima dovolj mest v javnih vrtcih, morala izdati dovoljenje za odpiranje dodatnih zasebnih kapacitet. Ocenila je, da je to pravi pristop, saj da bi z odtekanjem denarja v zasebne ustanove sčasoma zmanjkalo denarja za plače v javnih vzgoji in izobraževanju, obnovo šol in tako dalje.
""Odprtje plačnega sistema s PKP 10 je bilo absurd, ki je odprl Pandorino skrinjico,"" pa je poudarila Hotova. Strinjala se je, da treba plačni sistem prenoviti: ""Ampak izključno z dialogom."" Tudi ona sicer meni, da ""lahko na račun zasebnega izgubljamo javno"": ""V trenutku, ko se bo občinam bolj izplačalo podpirati zasebno, lahko v javnem izgubimo. Če bodo tam dali nekoliko višje plače, bomo vzgojiteljice, ki jih imamo zdaj v javnem, izgubili."" Poudarila je, da se ne sme dopustiti, da bi se razgradil javni sistem, za katerega je treba poskrbeti z ustreznimi plačami in razmerami.
""Demonizacija česar koli, tudi zasebnega kapitala, ni umestna,"" pa se ni strinjala Bregantova. ""Vprašati se moramo, kaj pravzaprav potrebujejo naši otroci. Seveda moramo najti ustrezno regulacijo, ampak če se izvaja enak program z enako kakovostjo, potem je prav, da je plačan. Kar se tiče tega, da bodo vzgojiteljice nekje plačane bolje kot drugje, pa je to krasno izhodišče, da se o plačah vzgojiteljic v javnem sistemu začnemo pogovarjati na drugačen način, saj to v resnici ne spodbuja le konkurence, ampak boljše delo na vseh nivojih, tudi državnem,"" je dejala.
130.000 državljanov nima osebnega zdravnika. Kaj zdaj?
Se nam torej v vrtcih lahko zgodi to, kar se dogaja v javnem zdravstvenem sistemu, ko ni zdravnikov? ""Vemo, koliko je tistih, ki ne dobijo osebnega zdravnika, ker so zdravniki pri zasebnikih,"" je izpostavil voditelj.
""To ne bo držalo. Res je, da je 130.000 državljanov ostalo brez zdravnika, v Sloveniji manjka tisoč zdravnikov. V zadnjih desetih letih smo jih približno polovico izgubili, ker so šli v tujino, približno polovica pa jih sploh ne dela v zdravstvu. Kaj je torej narobe z našimi delovnimi razmerami? To moramo nasloviti,"" je dejala Bregantova.
Bregantova je tudi pozvala državljane, naj si ogledajo svoj plačni list in ugotovijo, koliko denarja namenjajo zdravstvu: ""In zavod za zdravstveno zavarovanje, ki bi moral zagotavljati zdravnike, pravzaprav ni mehanizem, v katerem bi, čeprav si zdravstvu 40 let plačeval tako velike vsote, prišel do svojega zdravnika. Kakšne pogodbe imamo državljani z zavodom za zdravstveno zavarovanje?""
""V teh dveh letih smo storili kar nekaj korakov, da težavo rešimo,"" pa je dejala Jerajeva. ""Povečali smo število specializacij, povečali smo vpis na obe medicinski fakulteti, pogovarjali smo se o novih plačnih razmerjih, zagotovili denar za izboljšanje razmer …"" Zdravnikov pa se v dveh letih ne glede na ukrepe ne da narediti, je še poudarila. Rešitev za tiste, ki nimajo osebnega zdravnika, pa vidi v tem, da bi te paciente, dokler se ne zagotovi trajnejša rešitev, zdravniki sprejeli v zameno za nagrado. ""V nadaljevanju pa je treba poskrbeti, da bo kadra dovolj,"" je prepričana. Izpostavila je, da se na pristojnem ministrstvu področje pripravlja kadrovska strategija, ki bo olajšala reševanje izziva. ""Pa še nekaj smo zakomplicirali. V času vlade Mira Cerarja je ministrica Milojka Kolar Celarc v parlament prinesla zakon, ki je bil tudi sprejet, da morajo imeti zdravniki po končani fakulteti in opravljeni specializaciji še pet let imeti mentorja.""
Bregantova je sicer poudarila, da imamo na nekaterih mestih dovolj zdravnikov, ni pa jih dovolj na nekaterih najbolj ključnih. ""80 odstotkov zdravstvenih problemov se lahko reši pri družinskem zdravniku, če ga imaš. Ampak naši mlajši kolegi povedo, da zaradi razmer na primerni ravni tam ne želijo delati. Ostajajo v bolnišnicah, ker je delo tam drugače organizirano in plačano.""
Hotova je dejala, da upa, da bomo ugotovili, kaj je šlo v času epidemije narobe, da se je povečalo število mrtvorojenih otrok. Sicer pa je izpostavila težave na področju ginekologije. ""Podatek, da čez pet let 300.000 žensk ne bo imelo dostopa do ginekologa, je absurden in to moramo popraviti."" Kot rešitev predlagajo dodatna sredstva – med drugim bi dvignili DDV ter zagotovili reorganizacijo in boljše upravljanje. Strinjala se je, da je treba okrepiti raven družinskih zdravnikov, da bo to delo za zdravnike privlačnejše. ""Že na fakulteti jih moramo programsko usmeriti,"" je prepričana. Dejala pa je, da se ""vse začne in konča pri denarju"".
Kociprova je dejala, da v SAB želijo javno zdravstvo, ki pa mora biti učinkovito. ""Vzpostaviti bo treba tudi več nadzora,"" je poudarila. Izpostavila je stisko, v kateri se znajdejo upokojenci, če ostanejo brez družinskega zdravnika: ""Novega ne znajo iskati po spletu, zanje je pomembno, da ga imajo v bližini in lahko pridejo do njega."" Poudarila je tudi nujnost krajšanja čakalnih vrst, za kar bi uporabili tudi zasebne zdravnike. Del nujno potrebnega denarja za zdravstvo pa bi dobili s centralizacijo naročanja, pri katerem se ""izgubljajo milijoni"".
Klakočar Zupančičeva je dejala, da podpirajo javno zdravstvo, med ukrepi pa je izpostavila prestrukturiranje zdravstva in boj proti korupciji: ""Verjetno je denarja dovolj, rešiti pa je treba vprašanje, kam gre. Korupcija v zdravstvu je luknja brez dna.""

Seksizem, fašisti in diktatorji ali zakaj je v politiki malo žensk
V nadaljevanju soočenja so se dotaknili tudi vprašanja majhnega števila žensk v politiki. ""Ženske se težje odločijo za te funkcije. Danes nas zmerjajo s fašisti, diktatorji, in za ženske je to precej težko,"" je ocenila Jerajeva.
Kociprova meni, da se je treba aktivno truditi, da bi ženske privabili v politiko: ""Se pa ženske res težje odločijo, težko je kombinirati družino in delo, mnoge ženske skrbijo še za starše in ob vsem tem biti vedno nasmejan in vse vedeti je res težko.""
Hotova je sicer izrazila nasprotovanje kvotam: ""Ženske smo absolutno enako sposobne kot moški, morale bi imeti enak dostop do vseh delov družbenega življenja. A ni tako. Ženske smo deležne izjemnih žaljivk, seksizma, ravno ta kampanja je pokazala, da kot družba nismo napredovali."" Izpostavila je ukvarjanje spletnih komentatorjev z videzom, ne vsebino, in poudarila težavo žaljivega govora. ""Začel se je v političnem prostoru in se prenesel v vse pore družbe. Lahko se ne strinjamo, ampak sporočilo lahko prenesemo argumentirano,"" je poudarila. Poudarila je tudi, da morajo moški pustiti nekaj prostora ženskam, predvsem pa jih dojemati kot enakovredne. ""Toliko seksizma, kot sem ga bila v parlamentu deležna v zadnjih letih, nisem bila še nikoli,"" je dodala.
Bregantova je dejala, da želi v politiko prinesti empatijo in enakovrednost odnosov.
Klakočar Zupančičeva pa je dejala, da si ni nikoli mislila, da bo pristala v politiki, ker je pri nas ""politika politikantstvo"" in ker se sovražni govor ""širi z vrha navzdol"": ""Ampak sem se odločila za politiko, ker so me nekatere stvari, ki so se dogajale v zadnjih dveh letih,  tako motile, da nisem mogla biti več tiho, čeprav sem bila zaradi tega tudi tarča groženj.""
Ob koncu so se predstavnice strank dotaknile tudi področja pravne države. Medtem ko je Jerajeva menila, da Slovenci malo zaupamo pravni državi, končno pa je dovoljeno tudi kritično govoriti o sodstvu, je nekdanja sodnica Klakočar Zupančičeva menila, da ima aktualna oblast izjemno slab odnos do sodstva, to pa se pred njim ne more braniti, ker ""ima zavezana usta"": ""Sodniki vedo, da bodo tarča javne diskreditacije. Pa veste, kaj to pomeni za sodnika, ki mora pred stranko vzbujati spoštovanje? Mi ne spoštujemo niti odločb ustavnega sodišča, krivimo ga celo za smrt ljudi, ker je ugotovilo neustavnost odlokov, ki so bili neustavni. Potem je pravna država v razsulu. In to moramo zgraditi.""

This time, representatives of five political parties met: Alenka Jeraj (SDS), Urška Klakočar Zupančič (Freedom Movement), Meira Hot (SD), Maša Kociper (SAB) and Tina Bregant (Let's Connect Slovenia). At the forefront are kindergartens, healthcare, masks and the rule of law.","Tina Bregant said that 130,000 citizens in Slovenia were left without a doctor.
About 130,000 or about six percent of people in the public health network do not have a chosen personal family, children's or school doctor, but this cannot be entirely attributed to the lack of doctors, as - at least according to the list published on the ZZZS website - almost 300 doctors still accepting new patients. The proportion of people who do not have a doctor of their choice has been more or less the same in the last few years, ranging between five and almost seven percent.
According to her, we are missing a thousand doctors, according to the Chamber of Physicians. In addition, Bregant says we’ve lost about half of them in the last ten years because they went abroad, and about half don’t work in healthcare at all. According to the Chamber of Physicians and the Ministry of Education, 1,822 students have graduated from medical faculties in the last six years. 1,693 of them joined the Medical Chamber, which grants, renews and revokes medical licenses, which means that 138 people did not decide to work in health care after completing their studies. Another 147 people have returned their licenses in those six years. However, there is no official data on the numerical ratio between those who decided to pursue a career in another activity and those who remained in the medical profession, but not in Slovenia.
Did kindergarten kids really have to wear masks?
Urška Klakočar Zupančič, Movement Freedom: ""During the epidemic, our children were treated inappropriately. In kindergartens, masks that had to be worn by small children. To me - but I'm not a doctor - it seems inappropriate. As well as many doctors.""
Wearing protective masks for children in kindergarten has never been mandatory, epidemic measures are remembered in the Community of Kindergartens of Slovenia. Moreover, the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) wrote in the recommendations on September 3, 2020: ""The use of masks in children up to and including the age of five is not recommended due to the risk of suffocation and reduced ability to use properly.""
Wearing a mask indoors - yes or no? Unanimously against.
Asked whether they continue to support wearing a protective mask indoors, all five representatives of political parties answered no. Alenka Jeraj, an MP from the largest coalition party SDS, announced that the government would adopt this measure soon.
Meira Hot to raise GDP for healthcare. Did she provide the right information?
Meira Hot (SD) said health funding would rise from 8.3 percent of GDP to 12.5 percent, comparable to the European level.
According to the latest Eurostat data for 2020 on the share of GDP spent by the European Union on health care, the average is eight percent, while the share of Slovenia's GDP is slightly lower, 7.9 percent.
Such are the data of the Statistical Office for Slovenia for 2020. The Czech Republic and Austria spend the largest share of GDP in the European Union, at 9.2 percent.
Jeraj: 'Slovenians trust the rule of law a little'
In its latest Development Report for 2021 (June 2021), the Government Office for Macroeconomic Analysis and Development IMAD writes that trust in the rule of law in Slovenia has improved slightly in recent years, but trust in the rule of law remains relatively low. ""Despite some positive developments, confidence in the independence of courts and judges remains low and low than in other EU Member States. Polls cite perceptions of policy influence on court decisions as the main reason. special interests (EC, 2020c). ""
Jeraj: 'At the ECtHR, we exchange first and second place because the judgments handed down by our judges are falling'
In the same Report on the Development of the Office for Macroeconomic Analysis and Development for 2021 (June 2021), government analysts wrote: ""The number of complaints to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and consequent violations has decreased significantly. they no longer deviate from the EU average (ECtHR, 2021). "" The report also states that the quality of the Slovenian judiciary is comparable to other EU member states. However, they summarize the research of the European Commission, which warns that ""electronic communication with clients is less regulated (eg electronic filing, service of summons to court or monitoring of stages of the procedure"").
Maša Kociper, SAB: Kindergartens in Slovenia are among the best in the world
Ljubica Marjanovič Umek, professor emeritus of psychology at the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana, described pre-school education in Slovenia as high-quality in her article The New Image of Slovenian Kindergartens from 2021. However, he points out that the last curriculum for kindergartens was written in 1999. How to determine the quality of kindergartens?
A document from the Ministry of Education from 2017, which was also confirmed at the college of the then Minister Maja Makovec, states: ""In the Slovenian school system, it is not possible to talk about a uniform quality assessment system (...).""
Professors Mojca Kovač Šebart and Andreja Hočevar from the Faculty of Arts write in their 2018 article Determining and Ensuring the Quality of Kindergartens in Slovenia that the effectiveness of pre-school education in kindergartens is low compared to financial investments in the system. And: ""In Slovenia, we still don't know much about important aspects of the process quality of kindergartens (...).""
Reading literacy as a consequence of the quality of pre-school education was also addressed by the Court of Audit in 2020: ""The findings of domestic research examining various factors (...) in kindergartens and schools (...) leading to a higher level were also important. literacy. "" So what is literacy based on the results of the international PISA survey? ""The achieved level of reading literacy of Slovenian 15-year-olds in 2018 was on average practically the same as in 2006. With ninth place among 28 EU member states, we do not achieve the performance indicator from Slovenia's Development Strategy 2030, ranking in the top quarter.""
As professor emeritus Ljubica Marjanovič Umek estimates that pre-school education in Slovenia is of high quality, and at the same time the Ministry of Education warns that there are no uniform criteria, Maša Kociper's statement about Slovenian kindergartens, which are among the best in the world, should be taken with caution. .
Tina Bregant and Meira Hot on infant and stillbirth mortality
Tina Bregant said that according to OECD indicators, we have one of the lowest infant mortality rates in the world. In 2017, the infant mortality rate in Slovenia was the lowest among all OECD countries, at 1.6 per thousand live births, and we also have the largest decline in mortality among all OECD countries compared to 1990 (a decrease of 81 percent 64 percent).
Meira Hot responded to the words of Tina Bregant by not bragging at the moment that we have the lowest stillbirth rate because NIJZ data show tragic news that that number had risen suddenly during the epidemic. But be careful, the guests in the studio cite different information. Bregant talks about dead newborns up to four weeks old, and Meira Hot talks about stillbirths when a fetus older than 22 weeks or weighing 500 grams dies - before that she was classified as a miscarried fetus.
Regarding stillbirths, it is true that their number increased in 2020 - there were 114 stillbirths, and in 2019 87.
As explained by the NIJZ, they do detect a higher number of stillbirths in 2020, but they do detect fluctuations over the years, so it is difficult to talk about sudden growth. In 2021, the number of stillbirths fell, according to provisional data."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kaj-je-v-ozadju-razlicnih-interpretacij-ki-jih-ponujajo-stranke.html,What is behind the different interpretations offered by the clients?,"President Pahor still wants political actors to agree on who will be the prime minister-designate after the elections, especially since coalitions of parties such as the Coalition of the Constitutional Arc are running in the elections. She wrote in the agreement that she would nominate the one who received the most votes, but at that time there was no public favorite on the political scene and her most likely partner Robert Golob.","The mandate for the composition of the government will be given to the one who enjoys absolute support among the deputies, ie at least 46 votes, and if not, he will entrust the position to the relative winner, says President Borut Pahor. whether or not to understand the coalition of parties that will run independently in the decision to grant a mandate to form a government as the sum of the parliamentary seats of all the parties that make it up or not. ""
Pahor says that it is necessary to define the relative winner of the elections, given that coalitions are also running in them. He believes that, according to our legislation, the winner of the election is the party or list that ran in the election independently, with its own name and list, and received the most votes. Marko Balažic from the Connect Slovenia movement has not yet announced the names of the weaker coalition, which is running with a joint list of candidates, and says: , which will overcome these divisions in the political space that we are witnessing now. Who will be the prime minister will be decided by the voters, and it is up to us to convince them the most with our programs and orientations. ""
There are different interpretations in the coalition, in which the parties go to the polls individually. ""It seems really natural to us that the one who gets the most votes among these five parties, and who will most likely form the government, forms the government. As far as I understand, we are all in the same position except SD,"" said Luka Mesec, coordinator of the Left.
The last thing we need is a long, painstaking formation of the government, says Marjan Šarec, after Tanja Fajon did not deny her ambitions in our pre-election interview. ""I would interpret this as part of a political or pre-election strategy with which this party somehow promises the best possible result. I think the protagonists in the Coalition of the Constitutional Arc are very well aware that if Robert Golob gets more votes than any a party from the Coalition of Cool, at some point of course he is the first to be likely to be supported to form a new government, ""explains political analyst Alem Maksuti.
Robert Golob answers the question of whether he expects any embarrassment in resolving the issue of the mandate in tomorrow's pre-election interview for our television and website."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/svet/zacetek-soocenj-s-petimi-kandidatkami-o-prihodnosti-nasih-otrok.html,"With five candidates on how it will be with masks, kindergartens, salaries and the rule of law after the elections","A good two weeks before the elections, confrontations are starting in the editorial office of the show Svet. You will be able to see the first one on Saturday on our website. They will host five representatives of political parties, five female candidates, with whom they talked about what kind of future we have created for children. Will there really be three million of us in ten years, as one of the political parties promises? What about masks, kindergartens, salaries, doctors and the rule of law after the election?","We first confronted the candidates with the question of whether they agree that there will really be three million of us in Slovenia in ten years, as announced by Minister Počivalšek. The candidates' answers were unanimous, with all agreeing that this would not happen. They were equally unanimous in just one more question: ""Do indoor masks even make sense?"" Asked why we still wear them, SDS MP Alenka Jeraj said: ""The government will accept this proposal at any time. The expert group says that we must still have them, so you will know that the government must always decide on on the basis of an expert group. ""
Disagreements also continued over the issue of the salaries of assistant educators. Many do not even receive the minimum wage. And while the government was willing to provide doctors with higher salaries, they were left empty-handed. Jeraj said that the government had to deal with the coronavirus and the epidemic for the last two years, so there was no time to open the payment system. After this answer, the leader pointed out that during this time the payment system of doctors has changed as one of the most burdened groups, although educators are also among the busiest at only 740 euros.
Then Maša Kociper, the leader of the SAB parliamentary group, also responded: ""According to the complaints of the unions, she did not have a good dialogue with all groups, obviously only with some. We are all aware that at some point, regardless of the government, this pay system edit and rebuild it. ""
The center-left candidates warn that Janša's SDS wants to set up a new judiciary according to its own criteria. Alenka Jerajeva thinks: ""Sometimes nothing could be said about it, so I don't understand why a judge shouldn't be asked today whether someone has a degree or not."" The current government had only four ministers in its ranks, two of whom even resigned. However, all the interlocutors emphasize that women are just as capable as men, so they want to occupy more leading positions in the new term.
As Meira Hot, SD MP, points out: ""Men must free up space and give it to women and perceive us as equals. I must also say this: I have never experienced as much sexism as I have in parliament in the last four years. And that's where it starts. ""
And why did certain candidates even enter politics? Tina Bergant, candidate for the Let's Connect Slovenia movement: ""My patients sometimes tell me that I feel sorry for politics, and I answer that with 20 years of work experience in healthcare I would like to have such leadership that I shouldn't have to go into politics, but I would do what I really know best. ""
See for yourself whether they are suitable candidates. The full confrontation will be posted on our website tomorrow."

It is also not possible to vote by mail from Russia.","According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, due to the security situation and logistical aspects of doing business in the Russian Federation and the suspension of postal traffic with Russia, the elections at the Slovenian Embassy in Moscow cannot be held. Voting by mail from Russia is also not allowed, the DVK wrote.
As they added, postal items cannot be delivered to Russia or from Russia to Slovenia or elsewhere in Europe, and internal communication routes in Russia are also very unreliable. This was also confirmed by Pošta Slovenije. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a visa must be obtained for every trip from Russia to Europe or vice versa, and air connections are rare and unreliable. They also stated that the conditions for Slovenian diplomats in Russia are expected to be further tightened.
Slovenian citizens residing in Russia will be able to cast their vote in the elections if they come to Slovenia and vote at t. i. polling station omnia. These are special polling stations that will be organized on the day of the elections, April 24, at the seats of the district election commissions or administrative units. To vote at the omnia polling station, the application must be submitted no later than three days before the elections, ie by April 20, the DVK said."

He stressed, among other things, that the DVK understands the desire and interest not to burden doctors and other medical staff with additional administrative burdens, but the DVK, together with other stakeholders, is responsible for the legality of elections and uniform application of the provisions of the National Assembly Elections Act. participate in electoral processes. According to the DVK, it is unacceptable that doctors reject applications for certificates to voters who want to apply at home due to illness. The number of these applications is not unmanageable and should not be a major additional burden for doctors.
The DVK further clarifies that members of district election commissions cannot be the ones to judge the health status of voters, so it asks the competent institutions to explain to doctors that by rejecting applications for certificates, they prevent the exercise of the right to vote. who, due to illness, are unable to vote at the polls.
It should be reminded that on February 3 this year, the DVK adopted a decision that a medical certificate is required to vote at home in the elections to the National Assembly. On 31 March, the DVK amended its decision to consider any written confirmation from a doctor (e-mail or any other written or electronic document) stating that a voter cannot go to the polls due to illness due to illness. The message can be written by any doctor and not necessarily personal, nor do they need to issue special forms, which could be time consuming."

Delo v zdravstvu je za številne predane posameznike poslanstvo, delo opravljajo s skrbjo in veseljem, četudi je delovnih ur veliko, denarja pa pogosto premalo. Obstaja pa tudi veliko manj rožnata podoba slovenskega zdravstva. Tista, kjer slaba organizacija in toksični odnosi med zaposlenimi pomenijo slab izkoristek sredstev, nezadovoljno osebje in slabšo oskrbo pacientov oziroma marsikdaj ti ostanejo celo brez (ustrezne) oskrbe.
Slovensko zdravstvo tako že dlje časa pretresajo zgodbe, iz katerih je razvidno, da medsebojni odnosi med zaposlenimi nikakor niso rožnati. Jasno ali bolj med vrsticami padajo obtožbe o notranjih težavah zdravstvenih ustanov, ki so eden od pomembnih razlogov, da mladi zdravniki odhajajo v tujino, saj imajo tukaj občutek, da pod noge padajo polena, sistem pa deluje proti njim. Znani so tudi primeri odpovedi strokovnjakov zaradi slabih odnosov. Zaposleni, ki odhajajo, pogosto navajajo, da vodstvo ustanove, ki jo zapuščajo, ni znalo zagotoviti ustrezne organizacije dela, preprečiti kadrovske stiske, prisluhniti zaposlenim oziroma ni znalo krmariti med zahtevami dela in privilegiji nekaterih članov kolektiva.
Težava ni nova, se pa politika njenega reševanja praviloma na daleč izogiba, javnost pa zaposluje predvsem z vprašanjem, koliko denarja je še treba nameniti za zdravstvo, čeprav je tudi po tem sprememb, ki bi jih občutil pacient, malo. Zgolj denar namreč v takšnih ustanovah ni rešitev, saj se osrednja težava skriva še nekoliko globlje: v slabem vodenju in slabo postavljenem sistemu, katerega težava je tudi, da se na izzive ne odzove, dokler ni (pre)pozno.
Bo v prihodnjem mandatu kaj drugače?
Gibanje Svoboda napoveduje profesionalne nadzornike: 'Želimo depolitizirati celoten zdravstveni sistem'
""Velik del težav našega zdravstvenega sistema izhaja iz njegove trenutne organiziranosti in upravljanja. Nejasna ločitev med javnimi (državnimi in občinskimi) izvajalci ter zasebno prakso močno načenja transparentnost celotnega zdravstvenega sistema,"" ocenjujejo v stranki Roberta Goloba. Napovedujejo učinkovitejšo porabo sredstev, racionalizacijo poslovanja, boljšo organizacijo oziroma reorganizacijo zdravstvenih zavodov in učinkovitejšo izrabe obstoječih kapacitet z ustrezno stimulacijo vseh zaposlenih: ""Pri ukrepih bomo izhajali tudi iz nedavnih ugotovitev Računskega sodišča o učinkovitosti ureditve javne službe.""
Zagotavljajo, da bodo na vodilna mesta v zdravstvu imenovali ugledne strokovnjake: ""Spremenili bomo sedanjo nadzorno vlogo svetov zavodov in skladno z najvišjimi standardi korporativnega upravljanja njihovo funkcijo nadomestili z nadzornimi sveti s profesionalnimi nadzorniki. S tem želimo depolitizirati celoten zdravstveni sistem. Vsakodnevno politiko je potrebno umakniti iz mehanizmov vodenja zdravstvenega sistema.""
Izpostavljajo tudi kadrovske težave slovenskega zdravstva: ""Veliko zaposlenih za svoje delo v zdravstveni mreži ne prejme pravičnega plačila. Nekateri to kompenzirajo z delom v zasebnih organizacijah ali nepregledno množico različnih dodatkov.  Sistem je posledično vse manj transparenten in vse bolj neučinkovit, kar znižuje zaupanje javnosti in vseh ostalih relevantnih deležnikov v celotno javno zdravstvo. Reševanje kadrovske problematike je zato med pomembnejšimi javnozdravstvenimi prioritetami. Med pomembnimi ukrepi vidimo tudi bolj sistematično ureditev položaja zaposlenih v zdravstveni negi, ki so pomemben, a pogosto spregledan kader v našem zdravstvenem sistemu. Trenutno prav ta kader zaradi slabih pogojev dela in plačila pospešeno odhaja v tujino, kar lahko že na krajši rok močno oteži delovanje celotnega zdravstvenega sistema. V Gibanju Svoboda menimo, da slovenski zdravstveni sistem nujno potrebuje drugačno kadrovsko politiko. Velik neizkoriščeni potencial vidimo v kadrovskem štipendiranju zdravstvenega kadra, ki bi posebno na srednjih šolah spodbudila večje zanimanje za različne zdravstvene programe.""
Levica nasprotuje vodenju zdravstvenih ustanov kot podjetij: 'Zasebno zdravstvo je potrebno popolnoma ločiti od javnega'
Pri Levici menijo, da je stanje v javnih zdravstvenih zavodih potrebno ocenjevati objektivno: ""Drži, da standardi padajo, da se nedostopnost povečuje, da kadra vse bolj primanjkuje in da je vse bolj izčrpan. A razlogi za to ne ležijo toliko v vodenju samih ustanov kot v dejstvu, da se v zadnjem času aktivno vzpostavlja paralelni privatiziran sistem zdravstvenega varstva."" Po njihovem torej najhujše udarce javnemu sistemu zadaja nelojalna konkurenca zasebnikov: ""Namesto da bi tako t. i. zdravniki dvoživke delo opravili v javnih zavodih, prek s.p. delo opravljajo pri zasebnikih in tako aktivno podaljšujejo čakalne vrste.""
Skrbi jih tudi stanje v zdravstveni negi – zaradi, kot pravijo, mizernih plač in dejstva, da se po vseh zavezah in obljubah še vedno niso sprejeli standardi in normativi v zdravstveni negi.
Javno zdravstvo se mora izvajati neprofitno, morebitni presežki sredstev pa morajo ostajati v sistemu, poudarjajo: ""Privatizacija in odsotnost načrtovanja zdravstvene politike sta pripeljala do točke, ko je vse več ljudi brez osebnega zdravnika, kjer se na posege čaka predolgo in kjer so kršene zakonske in ustavne določbe o pravici do zdravja. Zasebno zdravstvo je potrebno popolnoma ločiti od javnega in javnih sredstev, javni sistem pa okrepiti z dodatnimi proračunskim sredstvi. Obenem je potrebno zagotoviti izdatno proračunsko financiranje primarne ravni zdravstva.""
 V zvezi z idejami o menedžerski revoluciji in spremembami v vodenju zdravstvenih zavodov navajajo, da izkušnje iz tujine (Velika Britanija, Roy Griffiths) kažejo, da je t. i. The New Public Management Approach izredno škodljiv za javne zdravstvene sisteme: ""Stroški za administracijo so v ustanovah NHS narasli iz pet odstotkov na 12 odstotkov, povečal se je prenos storitev na zunanje izvajalce. Tako imenovane neklinične zaposlitve – čiščenje, pranje, vzdrževanje in varnost so predali zunanjim izvajalcem. Število zaposlenih v teh dejavnostih je posledično močno upadlo, in sicer iz 260.000 leta 1981 na 157.000 leta 1990. Cilj je bil dosežen in bolnišnice so varčevale, cena pa je bila visoka. Študija o prenosu dela na zunanje izvajalce v NHS je leta 2001 pokazala, da so ti zunanji delavci v NHS v Londonu prejemali manj kot pet funtov na uro, prav tako pa so se jim skrčile druge pravice, kot so dopust in pokojnine. Obenem so standardi čistoče v bolnišnicah upadli, močno poslabšala pa se je tudi kakovost bolnišnične hrane. Kar 10 odstotkov resno bolnih pacientov je bilo v času bivanja v bolnišnici podhranjenih. V Levici zato opozarjamo, da bolnišnic nikakor ne smemo voditi kot podjetij (saj tudi gasilcev in Policije ne vodimo tako). Cilj ne sme biti varčevanje, temveč zadovoljevanje zdravstvenih potreb ljudi. Gre za vprašanje družbenih in političnih prioritet.""
LMŠ moti popoldansko samevanje zdravstvenih ustanov: 'Z drugačno organizacijo bodo čakalne dobe krajše'
""Notranja organiziranost je sicer v rokah direktorja posameznega zavoda, ki mora poskrbeti, da odnosi med zaposlenimi ne vplivajo na njihovo delo. Poskrbeti pa mora, in to je naše pričakovanje, tudi za drugačno organizacijo dela, da ordinacije in operacijske dvorane v popoldanskem času ne bodo samevale, pač pa da bo zdravstvena oskrba ljudem dostopna tudi popoldne – danes pogosto ni,"" pravijo v stranki Marjana Šarca.
Razlog za to je po njihovem, zlasti v bolnišnicah, zasedenost precejšnjega števila zdravnikov s popoldanskim delom pri zasebnikih: ""Z drugačno organizacijo bo tudi javno zdravstvo popoldne učinkovitejše, čakalne dobe pa krajše.""
Vseeno pa menijo, da je ne glede na izzive, ki jih ima javno zdravstvo, edina prava pot ohranjanje in krepitev javnega zdravstva ter ukinitev dopolnilnega zdravstvenega zavarovanja: ""Zdravstvene storitve, ki jih izvajalci ne morejo izvesti, se zagotovijo z nacionalnim razpisom po t. i. kaskadnem sistemu, pri čemer se upošteva vrstni red: javni zdravstveni zavodi, koncesionarji, zasebniki. Za to se zagotovijo oziroma razporedijo razpoložljiva finančna sredstva.""
NSi upe polaga v digitalizacijo zdravstva: 'Zdravstvene zavode je treba preoblikovati tako, da delujejo neprofitno, a po načelih gospodarskih družb'
V NSi pravijo, da v okviru celovite prenove zdravstvenega sistema na področju kadra predvidevamo možnost nagrajevanja zaposlenih po rezultatih dela, pri čemer je nujna jasna določitev standardov in normativov.
""Pomemben korak naprej bo pomenila tudi dejanska digitalizacija zdravstva, ki bo zaposlenim v zdravstvu z administrativno razbremenitvijo prinesla več časa za delo z bolniki. V okviru digitalizacije menimo, da je treba uvesti enoten podporni informacijski sistem, standardiziran sistem zbiranja zdravstvenih podatkov, vključiti telemedicino ter uvesti e-osebni zdravstveni karton in e-zdravstvene izvide,"" poudarjajo.
Kot pravijo, verjamejo, da bo to pomembno vplivalo na boljšo organiziranost in razbremenitev zdravstvenih kadrov: ""Kar bo posledično vplivalo tudi na boljše odnose v ekipah.""
""Obenem je treba zdravstvene zavode preoblikovati tako, da delujejo neprofitno, a po načelih gospodarskih družb,"" še poudarjajo.
Povežimo Slovenijo stavi na piramido za zdravo življenje: 'Krepitev primarne ravni in stimulativen, inovativen način dela med kroženjem'
""Imamo najboljše zdravnike in medicinsko osebje,"" so prepričani v Povežimo Slovenijo. Zagotavljajo, da so glede zdravstva pripravili dober načrt: ""Gradnjo piramide, ki bo državljanu omogočala čimbolj zdravo in čilo življenje. Temeljni gradnik bo oskrba na domu, ker vsi radi čim dlje živimo doma, tudi zadnje dni želimo preživeti z našimi domačimi. Tu ima vlogo telemedicina, vrstniška pomoč, NVO, zdravstvena oskrba na domu.""
Ko gre za sam zdravstveni sistem, pa napovedujejo: ""Krepitev primarne ravni s povišanim vpisom na medicino in stimulativnim, inovativnim načinom dela med kroženjem.""
Veliko potencialov imamo pri informatizaciji, so prepričani: ""S tem bomo dosegli boljšo organizacijo dela, dolgoročno kadrovsko načrtovanje ter transparentnost poslovanja in plačevanja.""
SAB zagotavlja, da ne bodo dovolili, da zdravstveni sistem preide v zasebne roke: 'Predlagamo ustanovitev Agencije za nabave v zdravstvu'
Moderno javno zdravstvo je ena od naših prioritet, zagotavljajo v SAB: ""Nikoli ne bomo dovolili, da zdravstveni sistem preide v privatne roke, saj bi to pomenilo razgradnjo kakovosti in dostopnosti trenutnega sistema.""
""Mnoge stvari na tem področju so skozi leta preveč mirovale, neurejene in nedopustne problematike, kot je na primer dolgotrajna oskrba, pa so se kopičile in poglabljale. Tako je treba na eni strani najprej počistiti okostnjake iz omar, na drugi pa se spoprijeti z novimi izzivi, ki vznikajo vsak dan,"" ocenjujejo v stranki, ki jo vodi Alenka Bratušek.
Velik problem je še vedno korupcija v zdravstvu, izpostavljajo: ""V SAB predlagamo, da centraliziramo nabave v zdravstvu, da ustanovimo agencijo za nabave v zdravstvu – in na ta način poenotimo in znižamo nabavne cene, kar pomeni, da bo več denarja ostalo za storitve in bomo lahko skrajšali čakalne vrste.""
Dotaknili so se tudi tako imenovanih zdravnikov dvoživk: ""Treba je urediti in jasno postaviti pravila za delo zdravnikov.""
SD želi, da je glavno vodilo interes pacienta: 'Prekiniti želimo trend poseganja v strokovno avtonomijo'
""Socialni demokrati nameravamo poseči v sisteme notranje organiziranosti zdravstva s tem, da prekinemo trend poseganja v strokovno avtonomijo in presojo,"" pravijo v stranki, ki jo vodi Tanja Fajon.
""Smiselna notranja organiziranost zdravstvenih ustanov, ohranjanje dobrih kolegialnih odnosov, odločanje o napredovanjih na podlagi sposobnosti in ne politične pripadnosti – vse to mora biti odločeno na podlagi neodvisne in strokovne presoje,"" poudarjajo.
""Glavno vodilo pa mora biti interes pacienta,"" še dodajajo.
SDS poudarja pomen stimulacije za kakovostno delo: 'Pristopili bomo k ciljnemu izobraževanju vodstvenih kadrov v zdravstvu'
""Za zaposlene v zdravstveni negi je Vlada RS zagotovila sredstva za dvig plač,"" poudarjajo v stranki, ki jo vodi premier Janez Janša. ""Zaposleni v zdravstvenih zavodih morajo biti stimulirani za kakovostno delo, obenem pa nagrajeni za opravljen obseg dela,"" poudarjajo.
""Pristopili bomo k ciljnemu izobraževanju vodstvenih kadrov v zdravstvu, potrebno bo tudi usposabljanje članov nadzornih svetov za vodenje in upravljanje zdravstvenih ustanov, ki imajo v članicah Evropske unije status gospodarskih družb splošnega pomena,"" napovedujejo.
""Ustanove bodo vodili zdravstveni menedžerji, ki bodo odgovorni nadzornemu svetu. Vodstva ustanov bodo avtonomna tako glede vodenja ustanov kot nagrajevanja zaposlenih. Uvedli bomo nagrajevanje zaposlenih po učinkovitosti in kakovosti opravljenega dela z uvedbo fiksnega in variabilnega dela plače,"" še poudarjajo in dodajajo, da bodo omogočili sklepanje individualnih pogodb za vrhunske strokovnjake.
Najbolj pomembno je zaupanje v vodstvo
Težava sicer ni izrazito slovenska, izzive zdravstvenih sistemov najdemo po vsem svetu. Zanimiv je denimo primer Avstralije, kjer je leta 2020 raziskava med več kot 1000 mlajšimi zdravniki pokazala, da je velika večina v svoji praksi naredila napake zaradi izčrpanosti in izgorelosti, ki sta jo povzročila prevelika obremenitev in neustrezno kadrovanje. Anketiranci so povedali, da so na to opozorili tudi svoje delodajalce, ki pa so jih odpravili, ne da bi ukrepali. 
Raziskava, v kateri je sodelovalo skoraj 10.000 zdravnikov, ki se usposabljajo, pa je pokazala, da je bil vsak tretji v zadnjih 12 mesecih priča ali tarča toksičnega vedenja na delovnem mestu. Tudi pri nas mladi zdravniki redno opozarjajo na težave, s katerimi se srečajo na začetku svoje poti in številne so vezane prav na toksične odnose.
V sektorju, ki se osredotoča na skrb in ohranjanje življenja ter spodbujanje dobrega fizičnega in duševnega počutja, je takšno stanje več kot zaskrbljujoče. 
Strupena kultura delovnega mesta povzroča resen in stalen stres, posledice pa običajno preidejo tudi na druga področja življenja, kar pogosto negativno vpliva na odnose, zdravje in samozavest ljudi. Vpliva tudi na kakovost dela, ki bi morala biti ravno v zdravstvu najvišja. Tudi zato bi morala biti organizacijska ureditev zdravstva in odnosov v njem zelo visoko na lestvici prioritet politike.
V Avstraliji so sestavili nekaj priporočil, med drugim so izpostavili, kako pomembno je, da v ustanovi vlada kultura odgovornosti in da je komunikacija kulturna, odprta, pogosta, vključuje povratne informacije in ljudem omogoča, da so slišani. In še glavna sestavina: pomembno je, da učinkovito vodstvo ustanove uživa zaupanje.

In 2021, they have € 309,000 in principal and € 153,000 in trade payables. By far the most money in the accounts have SDS and SMC or. Specifically.","The most successful party in 2020 was the SDS party of Janez Janša with 644 thousand euros in the account. Compared to 2019, the situation has improved by more than half a million euros. Close to the SDS is the SMC with 603 thousand euros. Last year, the NSi party raised its account balance to just under 470 thousand, which is about 300 thousand more than in 2020.
These are data sent to us from individual clients for last year, otherwise the annual reports will be published next month. We received concrete answers from the NSi, SD and Levica parties. LMŠ replied that they “ended 2021 with a surplus on the account, without debts or outstanding liabilities”. The SAB stressed that they have the savings that they will spend on the campaign for the National Assembly elections. We did not receive a response from SDS, SMC and DeSUS.
SDS just under two million in revenue
By far the most revenue in 2020 was the SDS - just under two million euros, it also had the highest profit - 812 thousand euros. As they reveal in the annual report, the funds in their accounts have increased due to lower operating costs and additional funds from the budget. SD has the highest revenue, followed by NSi.
In 2021, NSi increased its profit to 425 thousand euros. SD's profit decreased from 170 thousand euros to more than 23 thousand.
The Social Democrats owe the most
The Social Democrats have the largest debt among the parties, amounting to half a million euros in 2020. The loan was rescheduled at Delavska hranilnica and the smaller amount of the remaining loan and the limit were repaid. We asked SD how much debt they have now, they said they have 309 thousand principals and 153 thousand liabilities to suppliers. In addition, they have almost 11 thousand euros in loans for a company car.
In 2020, SDS and DeSUS followed in indebtedness - both did not respond to our questions about how much debt they currently have. In 2020, the SDS disbursed a long-term loan to NKBM, and part of the disbursement was transferred to short-term liabilities. The SAB party emphasizes that they have no loans and debts, the same in the LMŠ party.
In this term, the parties nine million euros from the budget
For the current mandate, the parties received nine million euros in budget funds, the most SDS - just under two million euros and LMŠ - one million. The SDS received 25 percent of the vote, the most among the parties in the 2018 elections.
The Constitution stipulates a 4% electoral threshold for entry into the National Assembly, but parties with at least 1% of the vote are also entitled to money from the budget. In the elections for June 2018, there were four such parties - SLS (2.62 percent of the vote), Pirate Party (2.15 percent), Good State 1.52 percent) and the Greens of Slovenia (1.09 percent). They received a total of 1.2 million euros from the budget.
In addition to the state budget, the parties are financed from membership fees, contributions from individuals and the budget of local communities.
Outstanding LDS and Zares accounts
The Zares party decided in October 2015 to cease its activities, but five years later, activities are still underway to delete the party from the register of political parties. According to the data from the Zares annual report, they have 1,300.81 euros in their account with Delavska hranilnica. It really has a loss of € 15,038.83 - which is the sum of all annual operating results. In addition, customers have outstanding invoices to suppliers for € 16,397.96.
The LDS also has outstanding accounts - they ended 2019 with a deficit of 230,271.55 euros. Most enforcement proceedings (originating in 2012, except for the payment of compensation for the use of building land, due to the lease of municipal (local) premises - from 2014 to 2020, which were not approved by the headquarters) against the LDS were stopped, the annual report said. They say the basic task of party leadership is to rehabilitate finances. In 2020, they owed EUR 2,568.41 to the Tax Office and an additional EUR 65.50. They have partially repaid this debt, they still owe a little more than 1000 euros."

These are mainly posters on which the client boasts about the renovation of the cultural center and the construction of a winter swimming pool and an urban park. The municipality is urging the party to remove the posters.","According to the municipality, they were approached by many citizens, who were outraged by the statements written on the pre-election posters of the largest parliamentary party. ""Recently, the municipal administration and the mayor have been approached by several citizens, we have also received councilor questions, and we are also noticing considerable dissatisfaction on social networks. taxpayers' funds, on the advertisements of the Slovenian Democratic Party. ""
They wrote that they had sent an official letter to the SDS headquarters, in which they pointed out the use of graphic and content elements of municipal projects in implementation. The party was called upon to ""remove the ads from social networks"" in the spirit of correctly informing the public about the method of financing projects co-financed from the municipal budget, state taxpayers' funds and European funds.
The most exciting were the posters with a sketch of the swimming pool being built in the municipality, which reads ""We are building a winter swimming pool and an urban park in the municipality of Slovenj Gradec"", and the appropriation of credit for the restoration of the cultural. On the latter, the SDS claims on the poster that they have ""renovated the Slovenj Gradec Cultural Center"". Otherwise, it is not the only controversial poster in Carinthia.
However, the municipality of Slovenj Gradec is no exception. Some time ago, Ormož, Središče ob Dravi and Sveti Tomaž were bent down for similar claims written on election posters, where even the mayor of NSi, Mirko Cvetko, criticized the content of the posters. He also pointed out that these are investments co-financed by the state, not the party. He described the moves as ""tasteless"". Former Ormož Mayor Alojz Sok (NSi) and SNS MP Jani Ivanuša are also not enthusiastic about taking credit."

Is the data true?","The SDS party published a graph on the social network Twitter showing Slovenia's ranking in the World Peace Index (GPI). Vision of Humanity was cited as the source. The graph states that in 2018, when Slovenia was led by a coalition led by Marjan Šarc, Slovenia ranked tenth on the list, while in the time of Janša's center-right government, it ranked fifth.
We checked the data on the Vision of Humanity website, which publishes research, data and analysis by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP). The fact that Slovenia ranked fifth in 2021 is true. It was preceded only by Portugal, Denmark, New Zealand and Iceland.
The SDS graph incorrectly states the data on Slovenia's ranking in 2018. At that time, we ranked seventh on the scale, and not tenth, as the party states. In 2019, we then advanced by one place, and in 2020, marked by the covida-19 pandemic, we slipped to tenth place. In that year, the government was initially led by Marjan Šarec, and from mid-March by Janez Janša.

After Marjan Šarec resigned as Prime Minister on 27 January 2020, the government of Janez Janša began its work on 13 March of the same year.

In its report for 2021, the IEP stated that Europe remains the most peaceful region in the world - eight European countries are among the ten most peaceful. They also highlighted the impact of the covida-19 pandemic, which in 2020 had a negative impact on economic activity, free movement and international relations. Although at first it seemed that the pandemic would contribute to increasing peace, it later turned out to be only a short-term change. In 2020, the number of riots increased further, with more than 5,000 linked to the pandemic."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/romana-tomc-in-robert-golob-o-predvolilnem-oglasevanju.html,Romana Tomc and Robert Golob: When does advertising become an election campaign?,"In a pre-election confrontation with Robert Golob's accusation that the SDS started advertising posters around the country long before the official election campaign, Romana Tomc said that the law on what is allowed and what is not allowed in the election campaign is clear. So why did the SDS get a qualified opinion from the Court of Auditors after the last parliamentary elections?","The election campaign begins 30 days before the day of voting, according to the Election and Referendum Campaign Act. Party posters began to appear on the roads of Slovenia much earlier in this convocation of parliament: for example, on April 16 two years ago, when we reported that the SDS - and not the entire government - thanked everyone who stayed at home, and those who are fighting the virus ex officio.
In mid-February this year, more than a month before the start of the official campaign, posters of the SDS, Konkretno and Povežimo Slovenije parties began to appear. Did they violate the 30-day campaign deadline? The Ministry of Public Administration explains that advertising before the official start of the campaign is ""acts of freedom of expression and the right to assembly and association, as defined by the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia in Articles 39 and 42."" Clients can therefore advertise their work more than 30 days before the start of the campaign, which is checked by the Court of Auditors each time.
Are the rules really clear?
The Election Act, which regulates campaign financing, has been in force since May 2007. During this time, we elected four members of the National Assembly in Slovenia, three times the President of the Republic, three times MEPs, three local elections and 13 referendums. The rules should therefore be very well known to the parties, especially if, as Romana Tomc claims, they are clear. In the audit of the correctness of reporting on the money spent on the campaign for the last elections to the National Assembly, the Court of Audit issued a qualified opinion on the correctness of operations to the SDS, DeSUS and Slovenian National Parties.
The SDS was also given a qualified opinion because ""the SDS party showed that the funds spent were too high in the total amount of EUR 9,633.91"" - including costs that were not recognized by the Court of Audit as election campaign expenses. The Court of Auditors, which audits customers' operations, explains that campaign costs are all costs associated with the campaign, regardless of whether they were incurred or paid.
Information or campaign?
The Court of Audit will review the regularity of customers' operations this year as well. It will be clear from the report whether, for example, there is a poster with the SDS logo and a web link to the government website, which lists government projects for the development of municipalities, public information or the election campaign.
The Court of Audit emphasizes: ""In audits of election campaigns, the Court of Audit verifies both the correctness of the costs shown and the costs that are not disclosed, but should be because they are among the costs of the election campaign."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/stranke-o-tem-kako-bi-ravnale-ob-novi-epidemiji-in-katere-ukrepe-bi-sprejele.html,How would customers react to a potential new epidemic?,"The consequences of the epidemic of covida-19, which has divided society and exposed problems that have been accumulating in healthcare for years, will be eliminated for a long time to come. However, before we go to the polls on April 24, many are wondering how the future government will face possible renewed challenges in this area. We therefore asked clients how they would manage a potential new epidemic and how they would contribute to restoring confidence in vaccines and official medicine.","In Slovenia, the epidemic of a new coronavirus disease was officially declared on March 12, 2020, the next day the government of Janez Janša took power and began to take new measures to curb the epidemic, which drastically limited public life in the country. We first witnessed the cancellation of the epidemic on May 31, 2020, it was declared again on October 18, 2020, and on June 15, 2021, it was officially canceled by the government again.
In November last year, a new version of the coronavirus appeared in South Africa, dubbed omicron by the World Health Organization and described as worrying, as it spread rapidly due to the unusually high number of mutations. Fortunately, it has been shown to cause less chance of severe disease. The epidemic began to decline and - most importantly - the number of hospitalizations in Slovenia decreased with the increasing level of infection and vaccination. Slovenia ranks 23rd among the 27 EU countries in terms of the share of fully vaccinated population, which is 57.9 percent. Only four countries are behind it: Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
Controversy over vaccination and differing government action have caused divisions and many social hardships in society, and the epidemic has exposed problems that have been building up in healthcare for years. Not only did they stop the implementation of many programs, which made the diagnosis and emergency treatment of many patients too late, new covid wards had to be formed that needed additional nursing teams. The lack of staff, especially nurses, is a cancer of Slovenian healthcare, which we have been drawing attention to for at least a decade.
It is clear that we will eliminate the consequences of the epidemic long before we go to the polls on April 24, but many are wondering how the future government will face possible renewed challenges in this area. The Minister of Health Janez Poklukar announced a few days ago that he would leave the proposal for the vaccination program for 2022 to the Minister for adoption in the next term of the government.
Therefore, we asked the parties that the latest opinion polls show in the upcoming parliamentary elections how they would manage a potential new epidemic and what measures they would take, as well as how they would contribute to restoring confidence in vaccines and official medicine. shaken (global) political decisions over the last two years.
Freedom Movement: The treatment of covid patients will be placed in the existing health care system
The Freedom Movement said that the basic condition for effective management of the epidemic is to increase people's trust in government structures. ""In the Freedom Movement, we will set a different, regionally coordinated strategy for treating obvious patients, so that treatment is placed in the existing health care system - this will achieve equal treatment of all patients and ensure the smooth operation of the rest of the health care system. umbrella crisis multidisciplinary expert group.In order to raise confidence in vaccines, we will raise awareness of the population and improve their health literacy, ""they said.
They also announced that they would support the amendment to the Infectious Diseases Act (ZNB), which was prepared by civil society in cooperation with the profession. ""The amendment to the ZNB must not be based solely on corrections and proposals from the legal profession, but must be formed by a multidisciplinary team. All preventive measures and the need for vaccination against the spread of infection will need to be supported by scientific evidence. therefore, we will take as a basis the law already drafted by the Legal Network in cooperation with the profession. ""
Left: Our position on compulsory or voluntary vaccination is not unequivocal
Just as we know of various infectious diseases, responses to epidemics, restrictive measures and vaccination are also specific. Therefore, it is impossible to answer the question unequivocally, the Left pointed out. ""At the same time, there are clear guidelines as to the minimum and necessary conditions for controlling epidemics. Restrictive measures must be based on scientific facts and data and must be aimed at protecting human health and life. They must apply equally to all and be properly communicated. , otherwise the trust of the general public is collapsing (this has happened in Slovenia). ""
They stressed that vaccination is the most effective and cheapest public health measure against infectious diseases. ""As a society, we have successfully overcome infectious diseases through vaccination, which have caused many deaths and serious health consequences in human history. Therefore, the NIJZ data is worrying that the vaccination of preschool children in Slovenia is declining. The consequences of these infectious diseases can be very severe, such as measles, which can lead to blindness, movement and speech problems, and death, which in children usually leads to severe pneumonia, which can lead to hearing loss, brain damage and brain damage. Redness is a particularly dangerous disease that is transmitted to the fetus in 90% of pregnant women and still causes 700,000 deaths a year worldwide.Other consequences of the disease are also severe: deafness, eye damage, congenital heart disease, mental There is no specific treatment for rubella, ""they said.
Therefore, the Left supports compulsory vaccination in cases where irreparable consequences for public health may arise. However, they point out that a major drawback is the fact that vaccines are not a public good and are not accessible to everyone, but are ""patented products and protected goods in the hands of global corporations"". ""These are at the forefront of a multibillion-dollar global industry that primarily pursues profit. Thus, covid-19 vaccines are still not available to everyone in the global periphery. We are therefore committed to abolishing patents and intellectual property rights - at least for products designed ensuring public health - and for the public ownership of pharmaceutical companies. This would mean that manufacturers would also pursue the goal of ensuring human health, not profit. ""
Given that a huge amount of public funds is allocated for the development and also for the purchase of vaccines, there is no reason for the profit to escape into private hands, they say in Levica. ""Our position on compulsory or voluntary vaccination is ambiguous. The fact is that science must be trusted in professional matters and the benefits and risks must be weighed against public health. Public confidence in restrictive measures is key to these measures working. . ""
LMŠ: It will be necessary to build trust and eliminate intolerance between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated
Confidence in the management of the epidemic stems from trust in the managers of the epidemic. This is connected with the appropriate communication of both politics and the profession, they emphasize in LMŠ. ""Given the communication with which the government has often addressed people insultingly for two years and treated them as adversaries rather than allies, trust will first need to be established, intolerance between vaccinated and unvaccinated will be eliminated and tolerant and respectful coexistence will be restored.""
Managing the epidemic is also leading by example, and the attitude towards vaccination is also connected to this, they are convinced. ""Trust will be restored when the profession knows and is able to present the measures in a way that people will understand and set an example in their implementation. It is expected that a certain proportion of people will always have different views on vaccination or spread doubts about official medicine. , so it is crucial here that both politics and the profession know and are able to explain why a measure is necessary and what its effect will be. ""
NSi: Proper communication with the public will be needed
NSi warns that the management of the epidemic must in any case be carried out in close cooperation with the profession. ""In the event of a new epidemic, special care should be taken to communicate properly with the public. The epidemic of covida-19 was not always appropriate,"" they admit.
In general, according to international organizations, Slovenia acted appropriately during the epidemic, but the biggest problem was the lack of people's confidence in vaccination, which according to NSi is probably a combination of several factors - general society, political tensions, divisions, errors in communication at several levels. and the lack of media support for government measures, and the general reluctance of Slovenes to vaccinate, even when it comes to other diseases.
Let's connect Slovenia: Comprehensive, fast and efficient communication is key
The Connect Slovenia movement, consisting of the parties Konkretno, Zeleni Slovenije, SLS, NLS and Nova Socialdemokracija, said that the current epidemic has taught us that comprehensive, fast and efficient communication about the measures taken and possible further steps is crucial. citizens understand the situation.
""In addition, it taught us how important the potential of public health is. One of the biggest problems was the efficient operation of the subsystems, which is why more attention needs to be paid to evaluating and implementing existing crisis response plans,"" they said.
SAB: Any mandatory testing will remain free
The SAB announced that it would return the best experts to all professional bodies managing the epidemic (NIJZ, government advisory group) and set up an expert group to communicate the course of the epidemic and inform the public.
""For basic assistance in the treatment of patients with covid-19, we will train a larger number of soldiers. (Possible) mandatory testing will remain free for all and a standard to prevent the spread of disease and eliminate infected from the system. provide sufficient supplies and quality materials (masks, disinfectants, tests, respirators, etc.) for the whole of Slovenia, ""they said, adding that they will enforce the measures in accordance with the law and in accordance with the Constitution. ""The measures will be announced, logical and without daily changes. We will not separate citizens into first-class and second-class. The government's website will contain all the information about the epidemic that is currently the concern of civil society,"" they added.
SD: Addressing people respectfully and without threats
The Social Democrats said they would rely on the epidemiological profession to manage the epidemic. We would strengthen trust in public institutions and science, foster a culture of dialogue and cooperation, and lead by example. ""People would be addressed respectfully and without threats. Epidemics would not be used to change the values ​​and structure of Slovenian society. based on the recommendations of epidemiologists, ""they explained.
According to them, the primary means of managing a potential new epidemic are the empowerment of the profession and its complementary policy approach. ""A well-thought-out communication strategy that treats citizens as responsible individuals is essential to build trust in vaccines. We need to communicate information to citizens in an effective and respectful way, not by orders.""
SDS: Consistent implementation of self-protection measures
The SDS warns that consistent implementation of self-protection measures is important. One of the most important measures to curb the epidemic is also rapid testing for infectious disease. Vaccination, however, is the most effective measure to protect against the disease. ""People who are infected should stay at home and not walk among people. The most important things are self-isolation and that people know when to seek help and visit a doctor by prior telephone arrangement. Workers who can perform telework should work from at home, ”listed some of the more important measures they would introduce in the event of a potential new epidemic
The proportionality of the measures is especially important, they added. We cannot ignore the fact that modern medicine has overcome and eradicated a number of infectious diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, TB, black goat) by vaccination in the last century, when the vaccination of the population in a certain environment was high enough. to restore confidence in science and scientists and empower them to be critical of the diverse publications of quasi-experts on social media. The field of infectious diseases poses a major challenge for the NIJZ, which is responsible for vaccination and public awareness, ""they added.

A closed New Zealand or relaxed Swedish approach?
While the adoption of measures to prevent the spread of new coronavirus infection in the European Union was more or less uniform - Slovenia has always followed the example of Austria and Germany - Sweden and New Zealand have taken a diametrically opposite approach.
New Zealand's response to the epidemic has been one of the most successful in the world, according to most research. The island nation, which immediately closed its borders and completely isolated itself from the rest of the world, successfully navigated the first 18 months of the pandemic with its hermetically sealed system until vaccines became available to all, leading to very low covid-19 mortality. Life expectancy has even increased during this period. Protecting public health also meant protecting the economy, leading to relatively rapid economic growth and low unemployment.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has earned a number of criticisms, as well as praise, for her quick action - for example, she stopped public life for three days due to a single case of infection. While she has been criticized by many for her vision of zero covida-19 cases being unfeasible, polls have shown her support at home - according to a Spinoff poll, as many as 80 percent of respondents rated the government's response to the epidemic as good, almost 60 percent as excellent.
Sweden has taken a completely different tactic in the fight against the new coronavirus - instead of stopping public life altogether, it has chosen a softer, more open approach. There were a few legislative measures, but for the most part the authorities only issued recommendations that the Swedes simply followed. Restaurants, bars and shops remained open, children under the age of 16 went to school all the time, wearing protective masks was not mandatory, and over time it became recommended in health facilities and nursing homes. But even though the country was considered an oasis of normal life for a long time, it was later criticized for its risky strategy of creating herd immunity.
A study published in the journal Humanities & Social Sciences Communications showed that Sweden had a higher mortality rate from covid-19 than its surrounding Nordic countries, according to ABC News. “Sweden’s response to the pandemic has been unique and marked by a morally, ethically and scientifically questionable approach resulting from structural problems in society,” wrote a team of authors from Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the US. ""They put more emphasis on protecting their 'image' than saving and protecting lives,"" they said. According to the website Our World and Data, at the end of December 2020, Sweden recorded an average of 44 deaths due to covid-19 per million population. Denmark recorded five deaths per million population, Norway 0.5 and Finland 0.3. In January this year, when the omicron version was already prevalent in the world, Sweden was already doing better and recorded five deaths per million inhabitants.
What have we learned in the two years of the epidemic?
In view of New Zealand's successful results, the British Guardian has highlighted things that have proven to be effective and could benefit other countries in the future if they adhered to them as well.
Principles. At the time of the pandemic, the New Zealand government has always emphasized that the measures they are taking are primarily focused on protecting public health. This starting point was reinforced by key principles: leadership that took the opinion of the profession into account, an emphasis on fairness and partnership with the Maori, caution in uncertain situations, and a tendency to create appropriate conditions for future health care.
Effective communication and correct interpretation of the threat. Pandemics in themselves pose a threat to the entire population, and the behavior of individuals has a major impact on other people. The relationship in the sense of “We will have to learn to live with this” is acceptable in the omicron version, but it is problematic and creates pressure on vulnerable groups. Instead, we must strive to promote collective health security, take collective action and strengthen the role of those in charge.
Transparency and political consensus. In the initial phase of the epidemic, countries sought to reach a comprehensive agreement on dealing with the epidemic. Such agreements have largely failed, responses have become increasingly political and have led to poor decisions such as e.g. premature lifting of certain safeguards. Politicians therefore need to re-examine the mechanisms by which they seek transparency and political consensus.
Health infrastructure. The pandemic has also exposed a number of public health problems in New Zealand, such as the catastrophic outbreak of contaminated drinking water in Havelock North and the measles epidemic. These problems can be attributed in part to the fragmentation of public health infrastructure. The shortcomings highlighted by the epidemic can be remedied by reforming or upgrading the health system. It is important that effective health services are accessible to all.
Effective epidemic management tools. The response to the pandemic has called on countries to develop tools to deal with this threat as soon as possible. In New Zealand, these included, inter alia, the development of a national border and quarantine management system, a national vaccination register, a system for managing individuals with covid-19 and their contacts, and the adoption of rules on interpersonal distance and the use of protective masks.
Appropriate indoor conditions. After a pandemic, we will certainly remember how important ventilation is in preventing the transmission of respiratory infections. This awareness has strengthened the use of protective masks and the provision of indoor ventilation. But much remains to be done to ensure that indoor ventilation is high quality and cost-effective all year round, while not affecting our thermal comfort.
The covida-19 epidemic has taught us a lot, but this pandemic, and perhaps some other pandemic threat in the future, will remain a challenge. It will be necessary to focus on basic principles, effective communication and achieving consensus, while constantly upgrading health systems, concludes The Guardian.

On Wednesday, he drove from his hometown of Kamnik to Ljubljana, stopping at a well-known fast food provider in Jarše near Domžale. The Xheladini brothers, who are real stars on the TikTok social network, invited the leader of the LMŠ party to their kitchen. ""Someone can tell me that I don't have a burek, but I do have a kebab,"" Šarec joked after a successfully prepared meal.","On Thursday, the president of the LMŠ Marjan Šarec will visit Cerklje, Šenčur, Kranj, Tržič, Radovljica, Bled and Jesenice together with the candidates for the upcoming parliamentary elections.
As he points out, the visits are an opportunity ""to meet the voters, present our program and solutions, and to find out from the field, ie first hand, what challenges people are facing"".
He reiterated that the party's main goal is ""Slovenia's development breakthrough, which will be based on investments in science and efforts for a high-value economy, because only this will bring universal prosperity to the people""."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/po-soocenju-kdo-je-navajal-neresnicne-podatke.html,After the confrontation: Who provided false information?,"After Monday's second pre-election confrontation, we further verified the claims of eight party representatives. Romana Tomc (SDS), Tanja Fajon (SD), Marjan Šarec (LMŠ), Alenka Bratušek (SAB), Robert Golob (Gibanje Svoboda), Jernej Vrtovec (Nova Slovenija), Alojz Kovšca (Connect Slovenia) and Luka Mesec faced (Left). We checked the statements on market rents in Germany and Austria, on the operation of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant and the budget. What's up?","The Facts team checked the statements of the representatives of the eight political parties live, and after the confrontation we selected a few more statements, which we additionally checked.
In Monday's second pre-election confrontation, Infrastructure Minister Jernej Vrtovec said that last year we started an arbitration procedure between HSE and the American multinational General Electric Power, the legal successor of the French company Alstom Power, the supplier of Blaž Košorok. technological equipment for Teš 6, get 200 million euros back to HSE, so that ""today Teš 6 can do well without any problems.""
The lawsuit against the Americans was prepared at a time when HSE was led by Blaž Košorok, former state secretary at the Ministry of Infrastructure and current director of Gen energija. A Holding Slovenske elektrarne and Termoelektrarna Šoštanj filed a request for arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce on 25 January 2017, when HSE was headed by Gorazd Skubin. The purpose of the arbitration was to reimburse as much as possible of the alleged damage resulting from illegal actions during the construction of Unit 6. After more than three years, they reached a settlement of 261 million euros and not 200 million as claimed by Vrtovec.
Is Teš actually doing well today? Teš has been in the red in recent years, last year he even had a loss of 280 million, compared to almost 20 million the year before. Teš puts the record high prices of emission coupons in an unenviable financial position, which it has to buy due to the release of CO2 emissions into the air. Malfunctions in the operation of the sixth unit are almost permanent, which is why the operation of the unit has been stopped several times, and in 2018 the unit even caught fire.
The company HSE, the owner of Teša, is also in the red - it ended 2020 with a loss of 227 million, and the HSE Group with a loss of 184 million.
Is Teš a story about SD as Vrtovec says? In Teš, in addition to SD staff, SDS is also in leading positions. The former director of Teš is Peter Dermol, the current mayor of Velenje and a member of the SD, and another former director of Teš is Franc Rosec, an SDS MP. The late director of HSE, Jože Zagožen, was a co-signatory of the contract with Alstom in Paris, and was a member of the SDS. Former Teš director Uroš Rotnik ran on the SLS list.
According to his memory, Luka Mesec incorrectly stated the amount of the budget
During the confrontation, the president of the Left party Luka Mesec said that in 2019, during the government of Marjan Šarc, 10 billion euros were in the budget, and in the last two years over 12 billion euros, ie two billion more.
The statement is partly true. In 2019, the state budget really amounted to 10.16 billion euros, but in the last two years it amounted to more than the hard Moon - in 2020 it was 13.4 billion euros, and in 2021 13.5 euros.
How much do market restrictions on rents cost?
In the confrontation, Alenka Bratušek (SAB) called for the restriction of market rents, following the example of Austria and Germany. It is true that both countries regulate them in different ways, but honey and milk are not leaked there. In Austria, about half a billion a year is paid from the state budget to maintain such a system in Vienna alone. In Germany, the latest version of the law on restrictions has been in force since 2015, but excessive rents in Berlin were still a hot topic during the parliamentary elections last September.
In the data on the rental market in Austria, we relied on the data of the PIP Institute from Maribor, where they provide legal advice, assistance and information about the European Union. In Austria, they have developed a system of so-called housing for limited profit: these can be owned by the state, the federal states, municipalities, cooperatives, even individuals, even political parties; however, the owners must not be construction companies. According to the PIP Institute, around 300,000 flats are owned by municipalities, the vast majority, 220,000, are owned by Vienna, and an additional 635,000 flats are owned by so-called limited-profit housing companies. These rents are tied to construction costs, and with subsidies included, they range between three and five euros per square meter. However, such an arrangement does not pay for itself: the state of Vienna receives up to 450 million euros a year from the federal budget for housing, and the city adds another 250 to 300.
In Germany, due to rampant prices in 2015, the amount of rent was limited by law: roughly so, in areas where there is high demand, the rent should not be more than a tenth higher than the local average and should not rise by more than a fifth in three years . In addition to the federal law, the parliament in Berlin tried an additional brake in January 2020: in the capital, where the population is aging rapidly and rents have doubled in ten years, rents have been frozen for five years. The Berlin Act was repealed by the Constitutional Court because the rental market is already regulated by federal law."

How did they see the promises that would help young people to find housing, and verbal duels about wages and solving the energy crisis? ""Unfortunately, we like to write strategies, but it is very difficult to come to an operational implementation,"" commented Juvančič on housing issues.","Anja Fortuna, vice-president of the European Youth Forum, emphasized that the ideas presented by the politicians at the second pre-election confrontation were not new. ""They talked as if they were inventing hot water, but many of these ideas have already been debated, and many organizations have already presented them,"" she told 24UR ZVEČER. At the same time, she says that she is mainly bothered by the fact that she is only talking about these things, and nothing has been done yet. ""We are waiting for the implementation of things.""
""One has to be aware that there are a lot of models around the world that are already working. There is no need to invent hot water, they should tackle those things that are already working and implement them,"" she is clear.
Lawyer Nina Zidar Klemenčič also agrees with her: ""We told them about various models from abroad that are already working and that should only be implemented in our system. Two million Slovenia does not need to discover hot water, but only needs to adopt good practices from abroad. ""

She adds that she is interested in who will sit at the table with civil society organizations again after the elections and start actively preparing a model that would solve the housing problem. ""A big problem that almost no one talks about is also 'clean' social housing - these are those families who are not able to pay non-profit rents or living space costs, which no one talked about at this confrontation,"" she added.
Meanwhile, the executive director of the Association of Managers, Petra Juvančič, emphasizes that many promises can be heard in the pre-election period. ""We heard in the show that a resolution was written in 2015, which has already mentioned many of these solutions. Unfortunately, we like to write strategies, but it is very difficult to get to operational implementation,"" she said.
It also highlights two aspects, spatial policy and the centralization of the state. ""I am convinced that many young families would like to live in the green countryside if they had the public infrastructure to provide us with fast connections,"" he said.
What about the idea of ​​a Scandinavian model? ""If this is financially sustainable, I don't see anything wrong with that. This could be a good thing to help young people use the part of the salary that is not personal income tax to solve their housing problem,"" Zidar Klemenčič said. which emphasizes the problem that the competence for housing issues in Slovenia is transferred to the municipalities. ""Greater emphasis should be placed on the responsibility of the state to formulate and implement a housing strategy. The problem is that the state has always transferred its responsibility to local communities, but they are unable to do so.""
""As far as the announced change in young people is concerned, it sounds very pleasant, but sustainability and the impact on public finances must also be examined,"" Juvančič emphasized. She is also interested in who will be the next finance minister to deal with public debt. ""I really like the saying 'Let's not only listen to what they say, but also see what they do,'"" he said.
'The issue of the costs of the socially disadvantaged has had a very long beard'
The energy crisis was also discussed at the confrontation. ""The issue of the cost of the socially endangered has a long history. Many families cannot pay for non-profit rental housing; now that the heating costs are still high, help would be expected for the most vulnerable,"" said Zidar Klemenčič.
Fortunova, meanwhile, says the energy crisis is affecting young people in several ways. ""But the question is also how this will affect future generations.""
The issue of Robert Golob's salaries also came to the fore in the confrontation. At the same time, all interlocutors agree that the topic only distracts attention from other, more important issues. Above all, they want the candidates to cooperate and end the division of the nation. ""We have been following these debates for a very long time and they only obscure the problems. If I compare with sports - no athlete wins a competition by settling accounts with his opponents. He wins by focusing on himself and his training and improving his work content,"" he said. said Juvančič, who said: ""We can also ask ourselves whether salaries in politics are too low and thus create negative selection."""

Fajonova estimated that energy vouchers are just 'late firefighting', while Šarec pointed out the problem of reducing network charges.

Jernej Vrtovec (NSi) said that Ukraine should be included in European integration, and that good neighborly relations should be strengthened with neighboring countries. Robert Golob said that Orban's position was worrying, ""not only for Europe, but also for Slovenia"". ""Every nation only chooses its own government, but these results are very bad news for everyone the Hungarian prime minister has listed as opponents, the European Union, including the Greens,"" Golob added.
Luka Mesec challenged Tomčeva regarding a statement congratulating all the election winners. He asked her if they had already congratulated incumbent US President Joe Biden. Regarding the government's foreign policy, he said that it supports Orban and Vučić, who are also supported by Vladimir Putin. Alojz Kovšca accused Luka Mesca of deception, saying that the Connect Slovenia movement supports the Putin regime.
Marjan Šarec said that ""in Slovenia we know who is Orban's best friend. For the last two years we have been looking at what can happen if we do not make the right decision on April 24. Of course Orban won by a large majority because he has a tailored electoral system and has subordinates to all media. "" He said that Vučić and Orban were going through a ""school dictatorship"".
Robert Golob and Romana Tomc argued over the use of Twitter. Namely, Golob promises that he does not have and will not have a Twitter profile, but Tomčeva does not agree with this and says that Golob, if he wins, will not be able to communicate effectively with other prime ministers without Twitter. In addition, the SDS representative adds that Twitter is used by those who have less access to communication through the mass media.
How will we solve the energy crisis?
Regarding the energy crisis, Vrtovec said that no one will be cold. ""That's right, we can't give up Russian gas overnight."" He said that they were in talks with other countries to supply gas. ""It is crucial that we diversify gas supplies from Russia."" He added that prices will be comparable to today's. Golob said Vrtovec's promises ""have nothing to do with reality"", as the minister cannot guarantee this. ""There is already enough storage capacity to supply households. The burden will have to be borne by industry."" Golob said that when supplying gas, it is important to know that Russian gas is cheaper and that the decision to purchase it is strategic and unrelated to the sympathy for Russia.
Šarec reiterated the idea of ​​diversifying energy supplies. He also said that neither the minister nor the government can directly provide prices. ""It's important for households to provide cheaper energy than for industry."" Vrtovec replies that the government has taken a number of measures, including energy vouchers, which have relieved households. Kovšca said that this was an issue that concerned not only Slovenia, but even the EU. He said that Slovenia also has other resources with which it can avoid the worst.
Tomčeva said the government was responding to the current situation in both companies and households. She reiterated all the measures taken by the government. ""Don't worry about whether we're going to be hungry or cold, because there will be energy in the fall."" Fajon said the vouchers were ""a firefight that came very late"".
Bratušková said that ""unfortunately, some people, some pensioners, were already cold before the Ukrainian crisis"". As she said, the party proposed three things: to use unused tourist vouchers for the purpose of alleviating the energy crisis, and to reduce VAT and excise duties. Luka Mesec said that neither Slovenia nor Europe had an answer on how to replace Russian energy sources. ""The state will have to protect all those most at risk from this crisis.""
How to get your own apartment?
The SD party promises 10,000 apartments by 2030. According to Fajonova, they have already written the law, but the government has rejected it. The apartments are left to the market, we are threatened with a real estate explosion, which would cause a severe crisis, he believes. The party calculated that they could halve the price of an apartment in Ljubljana. How? “With a combination of government money, loans and guarantees,” Fajonova says.
Romana Tomc pointed out that a solution exists and is currently in the National Assembly: the state enters as a guarantor so that young people can receive credit. ""You won't have to look for brothers, uncles, aunts."" She added that young people can also look for housing outside Ljubljana. Golob does not agree with Tomčeva. He says it is important to build non-profit housing. ""If we want to prevent a brain drain, the first ten years of employment, youth taxes must be zero.""
Real estate tax is not a priority for the SAB client. They promise a guarantee scheme for young people when the state acts as a guarantor, and instead of rent, young people pay a loan. They will also strive for more non-profit housing, and market rents should be limited, according to Bratušek. Luka Mesec reiterated that empty flats should be taxed. ""Those apartments that are empty are a question of whether they are really empty,"" Marjan Šarec said when asked if he agreed with the Left's proposal.
About oligarchs, communication in politics and freedom
Golob said he did not return to the political arena out of revenge. He noted that the government is trying to silence civil society movements such as the March 8 Movement. ""Political activists want to silence the police."" Tomčeva emphasized that there are non-governmental organizations in Europe that deal with social problems, and that the March 8 Institute was a political organization.
“It’s like we’re in a parallel world,” Fajonova said, adding that the current government is violating laws, the constitution and the government by decrees. Vrtovec assessed that it is necessary to look for contact points for cooperation. Tomčeva accused Golob of receiving extremely high rewards, and Golob told her that she had a higher net salary than him.
Post-election cooperation
Šarec reminded that LMŠ, SD, Levica and SAB had signed an agreement on post-election cooperation, and any party with the same values ​​could join them. Bratusek is convinced that the future government will be center-left, and that they will not cooperate with parties that violate human rights after the elections. Fajon promises residents a return to ""normalcy.""
Tomčeva pointed out the ""gap between words and deeds"" of the KUL alliance. “They talk about cooperation, but at the same time exclude it,” she said. According to her, the SDS is ready to cooperate with all parties with which they will be able to coordinate programs. She acknowledged that it would be difficult to work with the Left because of significant program differences. Golob told Tomčeva that ""less than half of the society is on the side of the SDS"", while Mesec emphasized that the Left in the government would make sure that the coalition agreement was not a dead letter.

Tanja Fajon: ""The government has a large staff of five before twelve. 160 tenders in the public sector for an indefinite period.""

Does the minister really set the price of gas?
Infrastructure Minister Jernej Vrtovec (NSi) announces that he will set the price of gas. Robert Golob (Freedom Movement) argues that the minister cannot influence the price.
The amount on the payment slip (as explained on the website of the Energy Agency) consists of the gas price negotiated by the supplier and the levies set by the Agency and the government. The government therefore has no direct influence on the price of gas itself, but has it on the final amount on the payment slip. The government can influence the price of gas by setting levies such as contributions, levies, excise duties and VAT. In principle, according to the Energy Agency's website, the government cannot influence gas sales prices, but exceptionally it can also determine measures to regulate prices under the Price Control Act.
Dr. Samo Bardutzky, Faculty of Law: ""It is important that the current Price Control Act provides for the temporary nature of price control measures: conditions under which these measures can be extended and maximum validity periods (eg in certain cases only one year). guaranteed right to free economic initiative (Article 74 of the Constitution) the price control measure cannot be permanent, unless the legal framework changes (which should be specifically examined in terms of compliance with the Constitution), so the government and ministers cannot This is a temporary measure that can only be taken if the government finds that the price of goods is too high or that the increase is disproportionate to international price developments, the general price index of the industry or the general price increase in this economy. industry. ""
Has there been so much investment in Slovenia in recent years due to the freezing of the fiscal rule?
The debate also revolved around the possibility of investment in connection with the freezing of the fiscal rule. NSi Vice President and Minister of Infrastructure Jernej Vrtovec said that they are building and developing Slovenia because they know and can do it, emphasizing the second track projects, the Karavanke tunnel, the third development axis, etc. The coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, said that Slovenia had been locked under the fiscal rule in the past few years, so there was no investment.
Dr. Samo Bardutzky, Faculty of Law, explains that Slovenia is a signatory to the European Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in Economic and Monetary Union of 2012. With this treaty, countries that have the euro have committed themselves to balancing or surplus, so that they will in principle avoid being over-indebted in the medium term. This commitment therefore prevents or makes it very difficult for the state to borrow in order to invest in infrastructure development. At EU level, on 23 March 2020, these rules were temporarily suspended so that Member States could act in the face of the economic crisis caused by the closure of public life and other circumstances of the pandemic. Thus, during the period of combating the spread of covida-19, it was in fact possible to increase borrowing without violating European rules.
How many solidarity allowances has the government set? Romana Tomc (SDS) says four.
""Not only will she pay the energy allowance, she has already paid solidarity allowances three times before and we need to look at this as a whole,"" said Romana Tomc (SDS).
- On 11 April 2020, the government approved the first anti-crown package, in which it provided for a one-off solidarity supplement for 328,780 low-pension pensioners. The amount of the allowance depended on the amount of the pension.
- On 31 December 2020, the seventh anti-crown package came into force, bringing a one-off crisis allowance to the most vulnerable sections of the population.
- On 3 January 2022, the government adopted the tenth anti-crown package and with it solidarity allowances for pensioners, farmers and particularly vulnerable groups. Height: up to 300 euros.
- On 25 February 2022, an energy solidarity supplement in the amount of EUR 150 also for pensioners, the disabled, recipients of social assistance, child allowances and foster parents. The Pension and Disability Insurance Institute announced on March 21 that this allowance will be paid on April 12.

Luka Mesec inaccurate about raising the minimum wage
By how much has the minimum wage increased? The coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, said that the minimum wage rose from 730 to 790 euros gross between 2010 and 2016. From 2016 to 2022, however, that it increased from 790 to 1024 euros gross. Is this true?
The gross minimum wage in 2010 was 734.15 euros gross, in 2016 790.73 euros. In 2021, the minimum gross wage was EUR 1,024.24 gross, but as of this year it is EUR 1,074.43. Luka Mesca's statement regarding the amount of the minimum wage this year is not true.

Who deserves more, Romana Tomc or Robert Golob?
The president of the Svoboda Movement, Robert Golob, says that the vice-president of the SDS, Romana Tomc, an MEP, has a higher net salary than he had at the Gen-I summit. Golob says that his salary is a good 6,000 euros net, and Tomčeva's salary is 7,000 net per month.
According to the Single Statute for Members, which has been in force since July 2009, all Members of the European Parliament receive the same salary. This is set at 38.5 percent of the basic salary of a judge at the Court of Justice of the European Union.
According to the single statute, the gross monthly salary of an MEP from July 2021 amounts to EUR 9,166.3. All MEPs pay EU tax and insurance contributions, so the final salary is € 7,145.04. Robert Golob's last salary at the helm of Gen-I was 6,245 euros net. Therefore, Robert Glob's statement that Romana Tomc earns more than he earned at the helm of Gen-I is true. We add, however, that most EU countries require their MEPs to pay an additional national tax in their country of origin. The final salary (salary after tax) therefore depends on the tax regulations of the country where the deputy is elected.
Have only shopping centers been built in Ljubljana in the last decade?
Asked why there are not enough flats in Ljubljana, Romana Tomc said: ""Because in the last 10 years, mainly shopping malls have been built, and there was the will to do so. We need to find land at affordable prices and then we can build housing policy forward. "" Is that true?
According to the Statistical Office, in 2013, almost 600 building permits were issued for residential buildings and 11 for commercial buildings in the Osrednjeslovenska region. The number remains about the same every year. The highest number of permits for residential buildings was issued in 2021, 753, and in 2016 the most permits for commercial buildings, 19. A total of 5,139 building permits were issued for residential buildings and 2,308 for non-residential buildings in the last nine years, of which 112 permits for commercial buildings and service activities. This means that the share of building permits for shopping centers in the last nine years was 1.5 percent of all building permits issued.

Romana Tomc critical of the Institute March 8
Regarding the Institute on March 8, SDS Vice President Romana Tomc said that NGOs in EU countries deal with some social problems, the environment, social issues, etc., while the Institute on March 8 is ""obviously, really obviously a political organization"".
Dr. Only Bardutzky, Faculty of Law, points out that freedom of expression is constitutionally guaranteed; under our constitutional law and international human rights law, interference with it must be proportionate and necessary. This is more true of citizens than of politicians exercising public power. Freedom of expression in the context of the exchange of political ideas enjoys particularly high protection. Thus, from the point of view of constitutional law, we cannot say that NGOs and representatives of civil society should refrain from expressing their views on political issues.
Every expression of opinion and every attempt to influence the political beliefs of fellow citizens is not yet an election campaign. The Election and Referendum Campaign Act regulates organized political propaganda in the pre-election period. Thus, any expression of views regarding participation in or voting in elections does not necessarily fall within the concept of an election campaign.
It should be noted in particular that the Election and Referendum Campaign Act regulates propaganda that attempts to influence the voter's decision-making when voting. The mere call for citizens to take part in elections is not yet an election campaign, as confirmed by the Administrative Court (I U 993/2019).
Month on higher taxation of the second and third property. What is the procedure?
The champion of the Left, Luka Mesec, said that they were also ready to talk about exempting the first property completely from taxes, and that all subsequent ones, ie empty flats, would be taxed. ""Just last time I met a lady who threatened me a little, saying, I have two empty flats, you won't take it from me, Mr. Moon. I said: I won't take it from you, but I would like to prepare you to hand them over. . "" But can taxation happen overnight?
Dr. Samo Bardutzky, Faculty of Law, warns: ""In the past, the legislature has tried to tax real estate differently depending on whether someone has registered permanent residence in this property or not. The Constitutional Court annulled the disputed law, inter alia, because such a distinction was not reasonably related to the subject and purpose of taxation. The Constitutional Court has found, for example, that the fact that someone is not registered in the second or third property they own does not mean that the property is vacant, as they can, for example, be used for living next to a residential real estate where he has registered permanent residence, another real estate. ""
What does the law on long-term care bring and what does it not?
Alenka Bratušek says that the law they passed cannot be implemented. ""It is not specified which services are included or will be available to retirees. There is no specific source of funding, no funding for implementation, it stands behind, I do not know how many rules to move this thing from the deadlock.""
Article 14 of the Long-Term Care Act lists examples of long-term care services: assistance with basic daily tasks, assistance with supportive daily tasks, health care related to basic daily tasks, services for strengthening and maintaining independence and e-care services. In the continuation of Article 14, the law also concretizes each of these sets, for example, as aids for basic daily tasks, it lists: assistance in eating and drinking, personal hygiene, dressing and undressing, excretion and defecation, movement, preparation for sleep and rest. Financing is determined in Article 48, which, among other things, introduces compulsory insurance for long-term care, but does not determine the amount of this contribution - this is supposed to be done in a separate law."

In the coming days, they will start printing ballot papers, and households will receive publications with lists of candidates in individual constituencies.","The candidacies for this National Assembly elections were submitted by 20 parties and the paper. With the exception of the Alliance for the Liberation of Slovenia (ZOS), the remaining 19 parties vying to cross the parliamentary threshold have submitted their candidate lists in all eight constituencies.
ZOS, which is a list of several parties, encountered problems in approving the candidate lists, which were recently conducted by the electoral commissions of individual constituencies. The Ljubljana - Center and Ljubljana - Bežigrad constituencies rejected their list of candidates, as its name did not show that it was a joint list of two or more political parties, as required by law. The Alliance appealed to the Supreme Court against the decision, which dismissed it as too late.
The National Electoral Commission (DVK) has now announced that the process of examining the submitted lists of candidates has been completed. At the same time, the electoral commissions of the constituencies drew lots for the order of the candidate lists in individual constituencies. The confirmed lists of candidates have also been published on the website in the order in which they will be published on the ballot papers. Next week, all households in Slovenia will receive a publication in which lists of candidates to be voted on in individual constituencies will be published.
What is the composition of the candidates?
According to the DVK, 1,471 candidates will run for 88 seats in the parliamentary elections, and another five are running for election to the Italian and Hungarian national communities.
When submitting candidate lists, the parties must take into account the 35% gender quota, and 653 of all the candidates for 88 deputies are women, which represents a little more than 44%. The oldest candidate is 82-year-old Tatjana Voj, who was included in the SAB's list. 18-year-old Jaka Krčovnik, the youngest candidate, is running on the Boris Popovič List - Let's Digitize Slovenia.
Most parliamentary candidates, just over 40 percent, are between 46 and 61 years old. Just over 30 percent of the candidates are between 31 and 46, and just under 19 percent are over 61 years old. A good 11 percent of candidates are under 31 years old. The average age of candidates on the day of the parliamentary elections will be just under 49 years.
Candidates for deputies also have a diverse educational structure. A maximum of 463 candidates have a 2nd level higher education. Among the candidates are 69 doctors of science, and 19 of them have completed only primary school."

Reason? Cost reduction. Due to the temporary abolition of the network fee, the largest electricity distributor in Slovenia expects a 20 million loss of revenue. This did not stop the President of the Management Board of Elektro Ljubljana, Aleksandar Zupančič, who was enthroned in February this year - the former head of the cabinet of the Minister of the Environment, Andrej Vizjak, bought a new company car worth 40,000 weeks ago.","Of the five executive directors of Elektro Ljubljana, two, the only women, Martina Pohar and Alenka Kolar, were called to the office on Friday, 25 March. The first lawyer and also the investment director of Gen-EL, the wife of Andrej Pohar, a lawyer, partner and head of the Maribor office of Čeferin. Another is an award-winning expert in the field of information and communication technologies. Both were brought to Elektro Ljubljana by the former president of the management board Andrej Ribič, who says that he was advised to resign by the SDS parliamentary group.
During his time, the fired Kristina Sever, head of the corporate communication department, and Neža Sluga, public relations consultant, were also employed. According to our information, they were hired again a few days later, but for another job and for half the salary. All four employees came and went with Ribič, who is also one of the founding members of the Zares party, even though they were supposed to have contracts with Elektro Ljubljana for an indefinite period. They are supposed to be fired due to economic problems resulting from the abolition of the network fee. Kristina Pohar is said to have received the dismissal due to culpable reasons. A few days ago, Elektro Ljubljana filed a criminal complaint against her and Ribič, as she allegedly tried to enable Bojan Kumr, the director of Elektro Energija, a subsidiary of Elektro Ljubljana, to buy an apartment in Ljubljana at an affordable price. According to our information, Pohar was only an official who prepared a contract on behalf of her superiors, but she was not supposed to have any influence on its content.
""Two employees were charged with suspicion of abuse of office and trust in economic activity. In March, the company terminated the employment contracts of two employees in the company's management to reduce costs and streamline operations,"" the personnel changes told our media yesterday afternoon. the house was confirmed by Zupančič.
Already last week, we checked several times whether cutting costs also means laying off. In the first package of answers to our questions, they wrote: ""In the future, we do not anticipate a reduction in the number of employees due to termination of employment contracts. The two executive directors, the head of one of the three departments of the administration and its employees, therefore held positions ""at the level of the administration"", at the expense of which - it is understandable - no further dismissals.
We also asked whether their positions - given that the reason for two employees is due to economic failure - would remain vacant and who would do their job, and whether this would mean hiring new, perhaps cheaper staff. Zupančič has not yet confirmed this. As he says, we will receive an answer in the coming days.
While the first question from Elektro Ljubljana was answered on the same day, we are still waiting for the answers to all the following ones - with the exception of the confirmation that four people in the company lost their jobs and that two criminal charges were filed against them. Among other things, we asked them what kind of vehicle fleet Elektro Ljubljana has.
Slap Ribič's staff?
The political pressures revealed by Zupančič's predecessor Andrej Ribič after his dismissal resonated in both media and professional circles. Our sources are convinced that the ruling authorities fired Ribič because he sympathized with the plans of Robert Golob, then chairman of the board of Gen-I. Together, they are looking for an interested external investor, which would mean lasting stability and easier operations for both companies, ie Elektro Ljubljana and Gen-I.
While the abolition of the network fee, which was introduced by the Janša government on 1 February for a period of three months, until April 30 - the measure expires six days after the elections - at least officially led to a personnel purge, the Ljubljana electricity distributor's fleet is clearly not influence. The President of the Management Board, Aleksander Zupančič, was interested in buying the first official vehicle in this position, a new white tiguan worth EUR 39,000, more than a month after taking office for four years, on 7 March. prepared for him in the Novo mesto salon Avto Slak, d. o. o.
According to our information, Zupančič has already taken over the new steel horse. We also asked Elektro Ljubljana what kind of vehicle fleet the company owns. We were interested in whether the purchase of a new vehicle was really necessary - given the financial deficits expected in this financial year. Zupančič explained to our media: ""In accordance with established practice, employment contract and SSH recommendations, the President of the Management Board owns a company car. The value of the vehicle is in accordance with the recommendations, and you will receive the exact amount after verification, within the legal deadline.""
All five electricity distributors in Slovenia predict that the consequences of the intervention measure to mitigate high energy prices will be in the millions. Elektro Ljubljana predicts a 20 million loss of revenue instead of the projected 87 million; they estimate that they will generate only 67 million euros this year. In order to prevent short-term liquidity, the company's management has already started implementing measures, which have been divided into four points. First, they reduced the funds for investment activity, postponed some investment projects, as a matter of priority, they are striving to conclude an agreement for the payment of liabilities from the PKP in proportion to liquidity flows, and the fourth measure is to reduce operating costs.
Who is Aleksander Zupančič?
Aleksander Zupančič, the former head of the cabinet of Minister Andrej Vizjak - by the way, both come from Brežice - is the former director of the Brežice municipality. He resigned from his position in his hometown of Brežice in the middle of his term in the summer of 2018, as an indictment was filed against him in the Krško court for the criminal offense of violating the fundamental rights of workers. Employees of the local utility company accused Zupančič of harassment, mobbing and unjustified transfers and dismissals. Zupančič described the allegations as untrue at the time. As we have also learned, the head of Elektro Ljubljana, when asked how he felt about firing four women on Mother's Day, said: ""I have no feelings.""
Zupančič is still the current supervisor of Petrol, another state-owned company. Cases where the director of a company sits on the supervisory board of another company are not common. He is a partner of Petra Grajžl, the third of the three heads of Vizjak's environmental cabinet, who has held a leading position in Slovenian energy in recent weeks. The government has appointed Grajžl to the position of acting director of the Radioactive Waste Agency (ARAO). Zupančič and his partner also have the VednoZavedno institute, within which, for example, they offer a coaching package for 360 euros, both of whom are also experts in the field of personal growth, according to the website. The package includes six meetings, and you also receive a gift. For 80 euros, they measure your life energy.
Elsewhere without layoffs
The remaining four distributors are also expecting millions in revenue cuts due to the abolition of network charges. They have introduced - or will continue to introduce - some austerity measures to keep the deficit as low as possible. In addition to Elektro Ljubljana, they will have a big loss, more precisely 16 million in Maribor and 12.1 million in Celje. Approximately 10 million deficits are expected in Gorenjska and Primorska.
As they say one after the other, they will not forgive - at least for now."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/fajon_3.html,'Sexist and chauvinistic remarks do not affect me as much as they should.',"SD president Tanja Fajon, despite public opinion announcements, maintains her prime ministerial ambitions for the party she leads. According to him, they have not yet agreed with the president of the Svoboda Movement, Robert Golob, who will lead the government if they form a coalition after the elections. Although the SD announces 'No Promises' on the posters, their program is full of promises. But are these actually feasible, what would they mean for public finances? In an interview with POP TV and 24ur.com, the SD champion spoke about relations within the KUL and whether she still sees Matjaž Han at the head of their parliamentary group. confrontation on POP TV. As she says, such insults affect her less than they should.","Let’s start with post-election math: we’ve been interested in the following for a long time, but we haven’t gotten to the bottom yet. What is the agreement between the Coalition of the Constitutional Arc and Robert Golob for the mandate?
There is no concrete agreement, we only know what we are repeating, namely that the one who manages to form a sufficient majority, as the President said, will go for office. Within the democratic arc of our opposition parties, we have committed ourselves to a post-election cooperation agreement, made a good commitment and established good trust. I see the Freedom Movement as a natural ally, but political calculations or. the electorate will give the mandate to the one who will be the strongest, at least at this center-left pole, to form the future government. I want it to be us, the Social Democrats, of course, but I also want it to be able to secure at least 55 seats with the parties of the center-left bloc, so that there will certainly be a stable government for one or more terms.
In the event that the Freedom Movement wins among individual parties, and the sum of KUL will be higher - who will be the prime minister?
We are still talking about this, we still have to agree. One logic is that four parties, if we stand together for post-election cooperation, would give their prime minister in this case. It also depends a little on what the difference will be. But we have not yet had a concrete conversation with the Freedom Movement and its president. Everything is still a bit unknown, because we only met the president and the party a few weeks ago, so we will probably finish that in the coming weeks.
It seems that you will not miss out on the possibility that you will also occupy the mandate?
I think this is normal for any political party that goes to the polls. We are a big party, traditionally strong on the ground. We are definitely going to win this election. That is my ambition. We are well prepared, with a clear plan, a strong team and mostly women and young people on the lists, so we are going quite confidently. But once again - the voters will show who they will give the most confidence to.
In the last four years, the Social Democrats have joined the government of Marjan Šarc, a newcomer to state politics, which has blown up. None of this worked out in the end. Why fight with Golob?
It is true that we had some attempts, desires and ambitions because of everything that was happening to change the government prematurely or even go to the polls. We were concerned about many issues in healthcare and the epidemic, how the government addressed the rescue, how it communicated with the public, how it sanctioned protesters, passed laws that did not fall under anti-crown measures. There were many things - including extensive staffing in independent institutions, the police and the army. These attempts did not get a majority. Unfortunately, we did not get enough votes, but we managed to put together program content through this process within the opposition, we worked on the content, got to know each other and built trust, including MPs, and repeatedly suggested to the government what to do differently and better. Of course, we have not heard from each other, but we have a basis for good cooperation in advance - I think much better than this government or coalition has experienced in the past.
I asked you about Robert Golob - why would he be a good Prime Minister?
See, he will be as good as anyone else at the head of the opposition parties is likely to be. If I look at my colleagues, I think they would all be good in prime ministerial positions. Prefer someone like that if people decide, because it will be a new face again, practically every four years, our electorate tells us. I think this is another issue that people are telling us before every election that there is some distrust in politics. That there is an empty, empty space, perhaps disappointments, especially in this liberal environment, which is emptied again and again with new experiments, new projects that come - behind are some of the same forces, even people, because Slovenia is small, these are not new faces , but apparently people are telling us that there is no trust in politics - this is the key message - why they are finally deciding on something new.
This worries me because I think it is much more important to give people back their trust than politics to work for them. My sincere mission at the helm of this party is to really try to gain people's trust - with what I am, with what I want to show with ambition and, of course, with actions. That these are not some empty promises. I want us to be able to deliver on what we promise today. I think people expect this from us, not so much new faces and experiments as that politics works for people and not their own interests, which is too often a practice.
What is the party's relationship with Karl Erjavec, the former president of DeSUS, today?
We don't have any special contacts. When we meet, we greet each other as we say. He is not our member, we do not cooperate. Several times he offered to bring part of DeSUS, disappointed people, by values ​​closest to the SD party. In fact, there has been no agreement with him since then. However, it is true that some older voters joined us in local organizations - sometimes DeSUS, but now our sympathizers.
How many were there?
I find it hard to say because I don’t have some analysis, estimates. In Styria, Mr Prikl brought a large group of disappointed DeSUS voters. They also came from elsewhere, but those sympathizers who will now have to choose in the next election from parties that did not disappoint them. I am talking about the parties that are still somewhere in the government coalition today, but before the previous elections they had a different agenda, which they are implementing today. These voters are disappointed and I reckon we will get a large part of the DeSUS voters here, who were once also part of social democracy.
You talked earlier about the disappointed part of the electorate. This one seems to be mostly on the left middle pole, but not so much on the right middle. What are you doing wrong about the parties in the middle left, that this is always a disappointment, and at the same time an opportunity for new faces every time?
We don’t have to do something wrong. But we certainly have significantly more democracy, people can say what they think. On the other hand, we have a leader, now the Prime Minister, with pronounced authoritarian tendencies and tendencies, who insults and discredits people, who also misinforms, especially those who think differently. In this way, it also degrades politics and instills mistrust. We have a very deeply divided political space on the left and right. It is difficult to find any reasonable cooperation. Because it seems to me that it is precisely with these populist rhetoric, dangerous and authoritarian tendencies, including hostility, discrediting women, sexism and chauvinism, which is also present on the part of the Prime Minister, that this introduces some mistrust and anger among the people.
Perhaps this is why we are in a bigger dilemma at the center-left pole, because we have to defend ourselves more often than if we are the ones who can move forward with some ideas and ambitions. We have been in a situation several times over the last two years - we are the opposition and we did not have enough votes - but when we wanted to change health measures, work together with the profession, work with reassuring communication, we simply were not heard.
Back to the pre-election dynamics: between the KUL parties, Golob inflicted a smaller blow on you and the Left than on the SAB and LMŠ. How seriously is the existence of KUL endangered?
All four parties are sovereign parties. People love choice and rightly so. We also differ from each other in terms of programs, and we share common values. I do not see the danger of the collapse of the democratic opposition here. Probably some party will gain more or less trust. I sincerely hope that all four of us will be able to cross the parliamentary threshold, because it seems to me that this would be the best center-left government, also because we really meet weekly - at least the party presidents - we work well together. We may have had some ups and downs from the beginning, but today we know each other much better than we did a year and a half ago.
However, the atmosphere in the right part of the political space seems to be much more relaxed at the moment than on the left. Do you share such an assessment?
No. I do not understand why the atmosphere would be more relaxed at the right political pole. It seems to me that it is as tense as it always is before elections. More. I think they are working endlessly after the Prime Minister always successfully destroys his coalition allies during his term. He is frantically looking for new allies, otherwise he will be able to repeat the mistake of the previous elections that he will not be able to form a government. It is turbulent when a new party appears in the center-right pole. It seems to me that the SDS is helping to reduce its reputation very quickly, but then there is significantly more unrest or effort to find new coalition allies. If we look at the outgoing government, all coalition partners are heavily strained with the exception of perhaps the NSi, and there are still many challenges.
Former SD president Igor Lukšič recently said: 'We always have some skepticism at the center left. Recent mandates have shown that this is a very inconsistent formation and that conflicts in government are very strong, that the pressures of capital blocs on such a government are much more relentless and diverse than in the case of a right-wing government. ' How do you respond to that?
I think that there have been significantly more challenges in the liberal environment in Slovenia in recent years, that the liberal environment has probably not been able to consolidate since the time of Janez Drnovšek. We see the emergence and disappearance of customers. These are experiments, satellites, at least in recent years we have had four liberal parties, two in government, two outside government, three in the European liberal family, one outside. It is, in short, an interesting combination. If they managed to unite and create a strong liberal milieu, I think that the Freedom Movement also wanted to do that, but they did not succeed - it would be very welcome for Slovenia and the political space. So we have these projects of various emerging liberal parties that want to fill this space, but instead of filling it, they are further crushing it.
The statute of the SD party dictates that you hold an electoral congress within six months of the election. What result of the SD party in the elections could jeopardize your position as president?
Due to the local elections, we changed the statute so that we have a congress a year after the parliamentary elections, so that we have enough time so that the congress is not in the meantime. I also have to make an analysis after the parliamentary elections, whether the party managed to improve the result compared to the previous elections, what is the internal climate, how much trust I enjoy, and all this will decide after the election year what SD will do at the next congress. I think we still have a lot of time for analysis and reflection until then.
So immediately after the parliamentary elections, you are not expected to make any moves in this direction?
I would have a hard time predicting because the only scenario I have in my head is that we make a good result. So I don’t think about it. What will happen if it is, we will decide after the election.
It will soon be two years since you took over as SD president. How much did you manage to get to know the specifics of the Slovenian political parquet? Have you often been accused of lacking knowledge of domestic politics because of your Euro mission?
That's right, I was able to meet. Probably not to the same extent as those who have been working in politics in Slovenia for 10 or 20 years. I think it’s an advantage if you’re not quite a good connoisseur, if you look at things from a different, perhaps healthier distance. It can also be a disadvantage if you don’t know all the rivals, players, or guts of the connections so well. However, I might analyze it in such a way that the political situation in Slovenia is extremely bad. Our political culture is at an extremely low level. And too often I have a feeling not only that politicians are an end in themselves, but that they care far too much about their own interests, that there is a lot of ad hoc action, without long-term strategies and talks, which I greatly miss in this space.
It was a disappointment for me to work in European institutions, good knowledge of the international environment - I have been practically connected with work in Brussels for 20 years, I know some other structure of work and I must say that my initial work here in Slovenia was a disappointment. Too many times, it seemed to me that this is one little sandbox of squabbling, where everyone is arguing about that space of theirs without having in mind what we want to do and really talk about it. That’s why I also understand people’s distrust because we too often give the feeling of being framed and sitting in chairs to protect our interest. I would like to change that. I would like us to talk much more in a cultural, civilized way, to agree on what we want for the people and Slovenia. I hope to be able to bring this into the space.
How hard skin did you get during that time? Do such sexist, chauvinistic remarks, which flew at the expense of your appearance after our confrontation, affect you?
I got pretty hard skin. They don’t affect me as much as they should. Because sometimes it seems that what is really unacceptable becomes acceptable. The fact that the media has been dealing with legs, insults, insults, crotches and also SDS staffing for a whole week now, not least with the content, worries me. And we are women too often, and I have been experiencing this since I have been in politics, the target of insults, sexist, chauvinistic ... For the first time, I really feel that politics in Slovenia is still a very masculine world. And I miss women and I want that female energy, so I was very insistent that we have half of the women on the candidate lists, which we practically succeeded in doing. As it seems to me that we women have a different empathy and reassuring communication, studies also show that women leaders perform well in crisis situations - not least in a health crisis. I want the men here to stand up for us. This must not become acceptable. These low blows that I follow on social media are really unacceptable. I also responded, I got a lot of support and we have to say no in the mainstream media and politics - not sexism.
You also helped women’s quotas in politics yourself when you carried out at least a seemingly agreed-upon replacement without much unrest, at least outwardly. At the time, it was understood that you wanted to make this change in order for the SD party to take the lead in the center-left. Why, as opinion polls show, why did you fail at this?
I still believe we can make it happen. Maybe I'm too optimistic by nature. But we can return to the previous debate - what is happening in the electorate in Slovenia, why distrust in politics? I see the consequences of this situation that the SD is stable and strongest within the existing opposition, but that we have a new party that takes the lead in the liberal middle, as distrust or apathy of our voters and the search for something new. But sometimes I would like to say what this new is.
How many people really wonder what this new thing brings to them? You know, we got new parties in parliament every four years, when you practically didn’t know MPs, which lowered the level of culture in parliament. We need to take all this into account, but I am aware of what people are saying - that they want role models that give them example, give them confidence, are determined and act outside the framework of existing policies. That way we can get confidence back.
Yet the SD was the relative winner of the 2008 election. Why do you still fail to make such a breakthrough? You are still far from that result.
Voters will decide, I believe, also based on the experience of the last week. When they decide - there is still a lot to do today, the percentage of those who are still undecided is growing again. Last week will probably be decisive when people say, ""Now I'm going to decide on this or that."" The media also plays a big role here, that is a fact. Opinion polls also influence opinion. What the interests of the media and opinion polls are, who they want to see as the winner, plays a big role.
I want the candidates to be treated as equally as possible in the election campaign, with the same media space and coverage, so that we can really present the program, the candidates to the people. I hope so to the last. Last week, however - even in 2008 there was a similar story - a kind of funnel is created on the one who will be able to beat the other side. But this is still not a sign of a healthy democracy. Healthy Democracy is a coalition of different parties and I hope that we will be able to establish a stable coalition in the next government.
You say the media is important. So have you appeared in confrontations that are broadcast on the pro-government media?
Definitely. I am a former journalist and I may look at the media a little differently. I absolutely agree with all those who today criticize political interference in the independent media, I am also aware of the political trumpet, the propaganda structure of Nova24's ruling party and the background funding coming from neighboring Hungary. But the fact is that during the election campaign, I want people to have a chance to hear what we want to tell them. And if this space becomes limited, today we have practically half of the media in the country, which are also under some political control of the ruling coalition. And if I start deciding which media to go to, I can also stand out from the confrontations of RTV. As the political structure there also came very ideologically closer to the SDS, this can be seen in the abolition of quality broadcasts and the way they decide in pre-election confrontations. My motive is very clear - to tell people what they want to have a choice.
But there is a difference between these media. Funding flows of both. The concern is that by appearing there, you are legitimizing these media.
I will not say that this is an easy decision. Planet TV went to a joint election project with Novo24 at the last minute. In SD we do not cooperate with Novo24, we do not answer to it and we do not appear in shows. And this was a difficult dilemma, I admit that we said anyway that we are going to pre-election confrontations, especially if they are credible and provide equal treatment. We are where we are now. Whether this was the right decision, I cannot judge. It was in my interest for as many people as possible to hear us.
Who makes up your constituency? How much do you jump into cabbage with the Left Party? What do internal research say? Are these your rivals?
They are not rivals, I am quite close to the Left. As much as one part of our party - because we have a very colorful party - can also be very close to the Left. The fact is, however, that our voters can reach into the entire center-left space, from the Left to the liberal center. So we need to address everyone - all age groups, including people in urban and rural areas. We do internal research just like other political parties - I see that we can address women much more, urban centers, where we have our constituents. However, they are true either in the middle space, which is still heavily emptied, or on the left. Which means it's mutual to steal our votes.
You say urban voters - you seem to be focusing quite a bit on city centers and the urban voters you have lost the most over the years. Can reinforcements like Jonas Žnidaršič take you on the path to the old glory you were on in the 2008 elections?
It is true that in recent years, before my arrival, we SD were quite busy in urban centers. I am from Ljubljana, I don't know if this will help us because I am running in Ljubljana. It is important that we have a good result in urban centers, especially in the capital. Above all, I wanted to open the door to the party - to address people who are not traditionally party political cadres, but to open up to civil society, a non-partisan sector with which I worked a lot in the past, and to get as many new people and faces, young old and familiar faces, women, and it seems to me that one healthy mix has emerged in the end.
It is a real recipe that we address people with faces like Jonas Žnidaršič and Blaž Zgaga, who came to our list outside of politics, I don't know. But I know it is right that we have new people who, above all, want to go into politics. My guideline was when we selected the candidates that they are people who want to work in the National Assembly, that they will know what to do, because we also had trainings for the candidates that they are ready for this role if they are elected. And to be faithful to the values ​​of social democracy.
You say you want to clean up the customer. You recently told Delo: ""Many times I don't even listen to my closest colleagues, because I think we need to renovate not only the party, but also the way politics works in our country."" Who and what bothered you when you took over the leadership of the party? Who had to say goodbye? Who is new, who do you trust the most in the party?
In fact, I don’t think anyone had to say goodbye. When I came to this house, there were employees here, a team that is still there today. I brought almost none. I more or less inherited the team, but I tried to build more trust between them, to see who is capable of what, where their interests and ambitions are. New ones joined through the process. Because I am by nature a person who needs to build trust, I do not listen to the advice and recommendations of what someone is like, but I want to create this opinion myself, to follow myself. It takes some time before I manage to build trust and choose who is close to me, and this time will certainly continue to run because it is a continuation of one process.
Who is your biggest ally in the party?
I think there are more allies, I have women not male colleagues. I have managed to change the teams of professional councils a lot, which are working really well today. I would not expose anyone by name for not doing injustice, because the bench or. the line of these people is quite long.
Would you still like Matjaž Han to be the leader of the deputies?
For Matjaž Han, I am convinced that he will make an outstanding result in the elections, because he is a terribly successful and popular MP in his environment. But it will depend on the results, where it will go. There may be some other ambitions as well.
Ministerial?
We will see what the next government will be like and what the coalition negotiations will be like.
You acknowledge that the client has made mistakes in the past. What still burdens her the most today?
The party has a long tradition. I often hear it on the ground and many criticize us for having had the opportunity, but not taking it, for being in government and not doing what you promised. I cannot be held accountable for the past, I have not sat in any government, but I want to influence the future. This backpack I hear about is sometimes heavy. It is much harder to manage a party with a tradition than a new party, to apologize in retrospect.
But it is also a school and a lesson for the future. I think this is very useful because you are aware of which mistakes you must not repeat and you have some knowledge and people with experience who can warn you of the dangers. I am interested in how we will work forward and I sincerely want us to make a mental leap that politics is not here for us, but that we are here for the people. This is really my wish and I hope that I will succeed with people who want to work honestly, have some high ethics and morals and are capable, they will not be here just because of some political card.
Which government position would you be most interested in?
I don’t want to calculate or talk about other people’s scenarios until we get an election result. As we go for victory, I am also ready to take on the responsibility of running the government. If we decide and are part of the government coalition and the SD has only ministerial posts, then I will decide based on the talks.
Surely the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is where to see each other?
I am certainly strong with political connections in international politics. I certainly have many friends with whom I grew up in Brussels and who are ministers today or have been ministers in different governments. These connections are sometimes underestimated in Slovenia. They are extremely important because Slovenia is small and vulnerable. Sometimes we forget this, and when some prime ministers who do not have an international background come along, we may be less heard and weaker.
Another cooperation with civil society. In the water referendum, all opposition parties seem to have had some of the cooperation with the March 8 Institute and the other initiators of the referendum. To what extent are you afraid of their criticism when or. if you are in the next government?
Criticism is always welcome and I have great respect for Nika Kovač as well as for civil society and the non-governmental sector. In recent months, I have tried to involve the non-governmental sector and civil society in all our discussions around the program and the expert councils. Now that we have worked with the Institute on the March 8 referendum on water, we have gotten to know each other well. I also collaborate and talk to Teo Jarc and Jaša Jenull and others because I am interested in how they think. Of course, they are a very critical and vocal civil society, and last but not least, I am grateful that, like the media, they are in control of what the institutions are doing. We are aware that they will remain equally critical, even when we are in government, but I hope that we will be able to use this to our advantage and that we will hear them.
On one of the posters you announce: No promises. But in reality, your program is full of promises, from free kindergartens, accessibility to a specialist in 30 days, 700 million euros to increase productivity, raising the minimum wage, free meals for all students, shorter working hours, raising the minimum pension, 10,000 new rental housing, increasing public health funding to 12% of GDP and more and more. How heavy are these promises? How realistic are they?
Without promises, it was a dedicated campaign and still holds true. My intention and the client's intention is that everything we have written in the program - more than 240 pages - is based on financial calculations, a timeline and is feasible. Why no promises? When I walked around Slovenia a lot in the last year, I mostly heard: ""We have enough promises. Everyone is just making promises. Politics is full of promises."" It is true that we promise politicians a lot and then we do not make it happen. So I set up this process of creating a program that took several months to do with the experts together and financially calculated to be feasible. At many points we had our own doubts, we talked to experts, but it is possible.
Example - 30 days to a specialist - is this possible? It is, with the right formula and agreement on how to provide more money in the public health system. One part may be the abolition of supplementary health insurance, the transfer to compulsory health insurance and the current increase in funds to the public health fund, while Slovenia is significantly below the European average. Everything that is written is not a promise. This is a program for 10 years, not for one term.
It will certainly need to be adapted to the given situation. The war in Ukraine has already happened to us, and it has made the world unpredictable and dangerous. We didn't imagine that a month ago. I immediately activated our expert groups to make an action plan, which I miss in the government. How to ensure self-sufficiency with energy and food? How to ensure the security of Slovenes and face the social challenge when even more Ukrainian refugees come to Slovenia? We worked out all this, we also had to prioritize, because the challenges due to the situation around us are different.
That is exactly what I am talking about. The situation is uncertain, and we have 40 billion in public debt. What will be the main priorities that you will not deviate from and that you definitely want to implement in this term? How much are they worth?
Regardless of the war in Ukraine, for which we do not yet know how long it will last, health care will certainly be a priority. Slovenians need quality public health. I myself have experience from 20 years ago: if I were not part of public health and did not have access to medicines and the best health care, I probably would not have overcome severe cancer.
Today I see that we have gone through a health crisis and people have not gone to a doctor or specialist, they have not made first or timely diagnoses, on the one hand there are too few family doctors, the private sector is strengthening and people have to choose whether to wait a year come to a specialist or they will pay to come next week, I see this is wrong. I want us to make the public health system with greater public financial investment, the goal is 12 percent of GDP in the public health fund, which is today's average in the EU. Above all, I want to keep the patient in mind.
214,800 people are waiting for health services in Slovenia. You promise these people they will get the service in 30 days. Is this even feasible?
You can ask the experts. I talked to many people, they all confirmed it to me. With the ambition and consent of all actors, this is feasible. And we will assure people that they will get to a specialist in 30 days.
In this term?
In this term.
How difficult is such a measure?
For the financial calculation, I should look in the papers so I won’t speak by heart. But I certainly say that funding needs to be increased. It is also a matter of reorganizing the health care system itself, which also means shortening administrative procedures so that doctors do not deal with them. It is about increasing funding to the public coffers. Certainly, one of the first steps is the abolition of supplementary health insurance, which people today pay rather non-jointly. Namely, everyone pays the same contribution regardless of income. Money is collected in insurance companies, even more so during the health crisis, instead of going to health care.
Who could solve all these problems on the government team? Who would be appointed to the post of Minister of Health?
I have decided not to talk within the party and my teams about who will sit in what chair, because I want people to prove themselves and show how committed and capable they are. If I decided in advance who would be where, I could take too many risks. However, I have a medical team led by a very capable Celjan Branko (Gabrovec op. Cit.), Who otherwise works at the NIJZ. But there are over 80 experts on this team today, so the range of potential people who can take over the health department is very large.
Don't you have a narrower one?
I have it in my head.
The health department was already headed by ministers from the SD quota, Borut Miklavčič, then Dorjan Marušič. Nothing major was done at the time to regulate this area. Why would people trust you today not to stick to promises on paper?
I find it hard to speak backwards. I think that, to be honest, no other Minister of Health has managed to make major changes, not least today, but the situation was different due to the covida-19 epidemic. I would say that we Slovenes have been quite unsuccessful in controlling the epidemic.
But I have this optimism that our medical team is very qualified and I follow their work, they have been working intensively for at least two years, they are talking, they include various expert opinions, I can't expect more than that. All I can say with certainty is that they are experts, they want to do their best, and someone has to accept responsibility in the end. Are we better now than anyone else? We are definitely better because we have a much stronger team.
You predict that you will significantly raise the salaries of nurses and medical technicians. For how much? Doctors are already warning that the relationship with last year's salary increase in nursing has collapsed. What are your plans for doctors' salaries?
Above all, I have the ambition to overhaul the single wage system in cooperation and social dialogue with all partners. What the government has done is to open Pandora’s box by excluding doctors. She forgot about other services employed in the public sector, including medical staff, technically, so there were protests.
When we talk about the reform of the single wage system, I know that this is a big deal, but it must be done together with the unions in social dialogue, that is our ambition. How will we raise wages? Certainly not in a privileged way only for certain groups. Our goal, however, is to ensure a minimum wage - at least 800 euros - and then progressively raise it.
But you probably have some idea in your head of how much nurses should be paid more.
I say that in all the negotiations so far, we have wanted to ensure that all together, as part of the public sector, are in a single wage system and not privileged. What the salary calculation will be depends on how we will adjust salaries to others in the public sector - in education, education and kindergartens.
Fidesz has long insisted on its intention to exit the public sector wage system. They say they will not back down from that.
There will be difficult negotiations. For each succeeding government, there will be a bit of work on how to reconcile different interests, but leading a social dialogue with the social partners and trade unions seems to me to be extremely important. I know this is a great challenge, but only in this way will we be able to reach some compromises that I hope everyone will be happy with.
List three concrete measures to prepare for an epidemiologically unpredictable fall in the summer.
Above all, I would listen to the profession, I would have a professional team led by qualified epidemiologists or. those who best manage the health situation. She could also be part of a government team. Then, with reassuring communication and compassion, I would like to invite people to help by respecting action. Above all, it would no longer go into ad hoc measures beyond the laws and the constitution, but through parliamentary deliberations introduce a backward rule of law when it comes to tackling the epidemic.
But you don't have a set of measures ready for the profession you are coordinating with now?
We have a very long list, we sent a set of measures to the Prime Minister throughout the health epidemic, so we also attended the first conference organized by the President, but unfortunately we were not heard. Of course, these measures are changing and adapting according to how much we know about the epidemic today and how much we knew about it two years ago. How much have we done during this time to ventilate the premises? Nothing. There is much more that could be done in schools, kindergartens and institutions if we were aware of how much ventilation means to prevent the spread of the virus. And I could go on and on.
What energy plan do you propose for next winter?
Slovenia has not been ambitious in recent years when it comes to renewables. Above all, we need to diversify our resources, which is, of course, a long-term measure if we are looking at how to provide renewable resources from either solar or wind power plants. Solar power plants could provide significantly more electricity today, but we haven’t done much. In the long run, I definitely need to put a lot of effort into renewable energy.
In the short term, what the government was trying to do - unfortunately very late also by lowering price margins and lowering VAT - was to ensure that we will be supplied with energy next winter. Prices will go up. The whole of Europe is looking for liquefied gas bypasses and supplies from third countries. Above all, we need to be very proactive here and look for solutions within the EU.
How strongly can you defend green politicians with Teš 6 on the coat of arms?
I don’t feel the burden of Teš 6, I’ve never dealt with that burden. Also in the SD, as far as I know, there is no one in any criminal proceedings regarding Teš 6. However, it is certainly true that this is a difficult issue that often burdens the party. Different teams and governments have changed, but I would like to be able to achieve the goals of closing the coal mine and rehabilitating the Šaleška Valley, for which we received European funds, and especially of a fair transition, so that people can work there and survive normally. .
These are tough challenges for the valley, there will also be tough challenges on how to provide electricity. Because today the closure of Teš 6 means that practically 40 or more percent of households in the country can lose light. These are the challenges that every government will have to address in order to ensure a clear energy and climate action plan. I don’t think any government so far has really succeeded in being ambitious enough to be self-sufficient. We Social Democrats are aware that nuclear energy will probably have to be a resource for some transitional period. However, this is such a sensitive financial and strategic issue that we will have to talk about it and agree with the people in the referendum.
You emphasize that you are strong in foreign policy and that the ties you forged in Brussels are your strength. How would you bring the arbitration story to an end?
In particular, by clearly following the decision of the arbitral tribunal or. the verdict we got. This verdict is certainly not to the liking of either side, but it is probably the most that Slovenia has been able to get and probably will not get better. I think any move that goes beyond respecting the arbitral award is very dangerous.
I am worried about what is happening in the silent diplomacy between the Prime Ministers at the moment, about negotiating a fisheries agreement, because this can mean a very dangerous deviation from the arbitration agreement and also non-compliance with parliamentary procedures. Last but not least, these critical voices of Slovenian fishermen, who warn that Croatian fishermen have no place in our sea and that we are deviating from the agreements, are extremely dangerous for the state and foreign policy.
Did the war in Ukraine surprise you?
Absolutely. I think it surprised and frightened the whole world, horrifying scenes of people, bombing and warfare. Putin's severe Russian aggression is worthy of the harshest condemnation. It is difficult to watch the scenes of mothers and children fleeing, almost four million refugees are on European soil, significantly more than ever in the history of Europe, and this will be a great challenge. Ukraine is largely destroyed. A lot of solidarity and European help will be needed before life can be put back together. I hope that in a peaceful way, through dialogue, without rattling with weapons and unnecessary solo actions, even small Slovenia can be assured of peace as soon as possible.
How would you act if you were in a position of power to be able to act?
Together with all European leaders. The EU has responded very unanimously with sanctions against Putin, very unanimously also in helping Ukraine, which is not just aid in arms, but aid in the supply of medicines and food, it is humanitarian aid. Slovenia could do much more with humanitarian aid. I wonder why Slovenia did not send someone to coordinate humanitarian aid in Kiev, instead of wondering why a diplomatic mission is going there, a man from the Ministry of Defense who raises the flag one day, lowers it again the next day, then raises and lowers it again. . It seems like a rather uncoordinated action and above all I miss the Foreign Minister. Somehow he has become absent since the war in Ukraine, it seems that this is only in favor of the Prime Minister, who uses such heroic actions for political purposes.
How do you see the role of our European Commissioner in charge of crisis situations?
I want him to be more heard, to be noticed more often in Slovenia, because he is still responsible for humanitarian aid. I don’t see much of him in Brussels either, but maybe I believe because he has a lot of work to do. Maybe I could give advice to Slovenia on how to take advantage of this humanitarian dimension and help the country, but unfortunately I did not see that.
At the beginning, it seemed that Slovenia was given a rather marginal role in the European Commission with such a department, which over time, through the challenges that followed in those years, proved to be quite an important role. In your opinion, is Janez Lenarčič performing his function well?
The department he has is very important. Already during the health crisis and natural disasters and all solidarity aid, Commissioner Lenarčič played an important role. I find it hard to judge because I don’t actually hear much. Which probably means he’s not that loud, he may not be making good use of communication, but he certainly has a lot of work to do. Whether he is working successfully can be better asked by his colleagues in the European Commission. Here and there, I ask Slovenians I know if they see and hear our Commissioner, but I must say that the answers are not very encouraging.
What is the possibility of you returning to the post of MEP?
I think in my head I have long ago accepted that I am returning home. If, of course, the election happens to be extremely bad for the SD, then I will look for and have to do other things. But this moment is my desire and ambition to stay in Slovenia.

We had a conversation on Friday, the day of the jokers. She wishes that among the statements she had heard recently was the April Fool's joke of Pavle Rupar's statement to examine his crotch. He adds that a grand coalition between SD and SDS will certainly not be possible as long as SDS is led by Janez Janša. And if I could hear Janša's answer to one question, I would ask him if he would ever apologize to her for all the offensive tweets.","The full interview with Tanja Fajon will be published on 24ur.com on Sunday.
1. Which statement you’ve heard lately would you like to be an April Fool’s joke?
Let me examine my crotch with a gynecologist.

2. Has the initiative for a constitutional review of the existence of the SD party harmed or benefited you?
None of that. In fact, I didn’t deal with it much. However, I am glad that the Constitutional Court has completely rejected the political incitement to wipe out the Social Democrats from the political space of Slovenia.

3. Closure of Teš? When?
According to the wishes, ambitions and proposals in 2032 or 2033. Given the energy challenges, the question is whether we will continue to depend on the use of coal. I point out that we need a clear energy plan.

4. What unites you more in KUL - a joint program or an anti-Yankee attitude?
Both. I think the joint program is crucial, because the anti-Yankee stance is not enough. We want to restore democracy, the rule of law, eliminate inequalities, it certainly unites us more. But we also need to know clearly how we are going to run the country better.
5. When will a grand coalition of SD and SDS be possible?
Certainly not as long as the SDS is led by Janez Janša.

6. In which case would you run for President of the Republic?
If I felt I had the support and trust of voters to express such a desire. Under many assumptions, this is a difficult decision.

7. Is a parliamentary transfer a fraud of voters?
I am not close to any transfer between the parties, because I always have the feeling that it is a matter of pursuing my own interests. And there may be too many of these offenders in our politics. Yes, to some extent it can also be a voter fraud, depending on the political spectrum of the transfer as well.

8. If you could hear Janez Janša's answer to one question, what would you ask him?
Will he ever apologize to me for all the offensive tweets.

9. What kind of voucher would you give people?
In this situation, certainly first of all energy and nutrition.

10. Who is your role model in Slovenian and who in foreign politics?
In foreign policy, my role models are certainly the New Zealand and Finnish Prime Ministers, who have managed the health crisis excellently and empathetically, both of whom are Social Democrats. In Slovenian, I could mention Niko Kovač, because she is a young, active, penetrating and also loud activist, who often reminds us of the challenges of society."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/tonin-na-taboru-nsi-izpostavil-ucinkovitost-stranke.html,Tonin at the NSi camp highlighted the effectiveness of the party,"According to its president Matej Tonin, the NSi party has proved that it knows how to work and move things forward, even when it comes to impossible projects. At the party's traditional camp, hosted by Kamnik this time, Tonin listed the current government's projects and announced a number of new ones.","""In recent years, many people have ridiculed us, saying, what will this NSi be, what do they know, what can they do ... Look at us today, because of our work, many Slovenes live better today and it has been proven better,"" he said. Matej Tonin emphasized at the party camp in Terme Snovik.
NSi, he said, is a party to action. ""Everyone who drives across the Tuhinj Valley or Kamnik can clearly see all the five million euros that the Minister of Infrastructure Jernej Vrtovec has invested in roads. A home for the elderly is being built in Kamnik, for which we have provided 3.6 million euros. , a school is also being built, for which the state has provided 2.3 million euros, the House of Culture and the Police are being renovated, ""said the Deputy Prime Minister.
As he pointed out, it is necessary to go to the polls on April 24 and say resolute not to all those who ""will primarily take us away"". According to Tonin, the decision will be simple: ""On the one hand, you have an effective NSi team, and on the other hand, even a phalanx of parties that predict revenge, nationalization and higher taxes.""
According to Tonin, there will be relentless fighters for four things in NSi. ""Certainly for our way of life, to preserve the values ​​on which Slovenia and Slovenia grew,"" he emphasized. They intend to allow the economy to breathe with full lungs, rather than suffocate it with high taxes and excessive bureaucracy.
He also pointed out public health, whose biggest problem, according to Tonin, is not money, but organization. ""NSi will make sure that we finally bring public health available to everyone in Slovenia,"" he announced. ""The fourth thing that NSi brings is more joy in life,"" he said, explaining that the demographic winter is relentless for Slovenia, and that the problem must be addressed immediately.
According to Tonin, today's snowfall is also a symbolic message to ""hot hotheads who have a hard time digesting and passing on that power in Slovenia is not hereditary and that there is nothing wrong with our party being responsible for running the government from time to time."" he knows and can "".
The camp is attended by the NSi leadership together with the ministerial team and the parliamentary group and the candidates for deputies."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/soocenje_3.html,"Fajonova warns of indebtedness, Počivalšek: We will easily repay the debt","Tanja Fajon, president of the SD party, and Zdravko Počivalšek, president of the Konkretno party, from the Connect Slovenia movement, sat opposite Petra Kerčmar at the first election confrontation between the Slovenian Entrepreneurs' Club (SBC). They mainly answered the questions that most interest entrepreneurs before the elections.","At the SBC confrontation, the guests spoke about the war in Ukraine, the law on personal income tax, the health crisis, staffing, employment in the public sector and also about what to expect after the elections. Zdravka Počivalška challenged the leader Petra Kerčmar at the very beginning in what way you are different from the president of the Social Democrats: ""I swear by connecting the sickly divided Slovenian political space, because I think it is important to look ahead in 2022."" Tanja Fajon, meanwhile, said ""So far I have not had the opportunity to sit in any of the governments."" But as Fajonova pointed out, she has different political experiences from another space, where political culture was at a higher level. In terms of views, the party is closer to the Left than the Resting Party.
On government borrowing and the Income Tax Act
The government's results are concrete, leading to record economic growth, the best credit rating and the lowest unemployment, Počivalšek said. According to him, the difference between them is that his movement would give people a fishing rod to teach them to catch fish, while Fajonov accused him of giving people fish. But Fajon immediately replied to him that one is words and the other are deeds that have been shearing lately. She blamed the government for the deep crisis of the rule of law, democracy and what was happening outside the Constitution and laws.
""The state of public finances has deteriorated markedly, the state is heavily indebted. We indeed borrowed at low interest rates, but this was no exception. The economic situation today is the same as before the epidemic, except that public finances are much worse and that we it will be a big headache, as this money will also have to be repaid, ”Fajon warned. Počivalšek, on the other hand, claims that we will easily repay this debt, as we have created high added value during this time and we are in fact winners in the economic field.
What do you think about the Personal Income Tax Act, which brings higher wages, but with a minimum wage of 13 euros, an average wage of 22 euros, and those with 40,000 euros gross, 15,000 euros or more? As Fajonova said, the SD strongly opposes this and advocates progressive and fair taxation, so that taxation is based on the principle 'those who have more pay more'. Počivalšek replied that the state is in an economic condition, which allows the state to take less and give more to workers. Less progressive taxation of higher wages is something that Počivalšek is convinced that we urgently need to address and that we will thus reward our brains to a greater extent.
Integration within the coalition?
Počivalšek says that it is first necessary to hold elections, and then the Movement is ready to hold talks with everyone, or at least with those who are for a common future. I cannot agree to the SD cooperating with parties that violate the Constitution and laws. These are all government parties, Fajon said. It is unacceptable for us that someone rejects someone, we are sickly divided, the current Minister of the Economy replied.
Muddling Akrapovic for oligarch and tax evader controversial?
Both guests strongly condemned the slander by politicians and the media. Fajon also stressed that insulting and lying and discrediting political opponents is unacceptable. And she spoke about the dangerous Slovenian political division into two poles. Počivalšek added that it was unfair to label both Akrapovič and Boscarol as oligarchs, as they are both prominent Slovenian entrepreneurs who created their companies with correct work.
Termination of the program on RTV Slovenia?
How do you view the abolition of quality news programs on RTV Slovenia? Počivalšek promises that he will also strive for a balanced public service. Fajon went on to explain that she is hurt by what is happening to journalism, that we are not providing balanced reporting, which is unacceptable to her. In the end, both guests explained who will be the first husband or first lady if one of them wins the election and becomes Prime Minister."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/kako-zagotoviti-ustrezno-zdravstveno-oskrbo-za-vse.html,How to provide adequate health care for all?,"In the pre-election period, almost all parties put healthcare at the forefront again - quality and accessible to all. But after two years of epidemics, healthcare is only getting more exhausted and even harder to access. Even before the epidemic, the long queues for various specialist examinations and treatments were even longer, with more than 130,000 people even without a personal doctor. Doctors from health centers go to private individuals or elsewhere - where salaries are higher and the workload is lower. More and more young doctors are also considering leaving.","We are people behind the numbers of Slovenian healthcare. On the one hand, there is a great shortage of doctors, which reaches the number of 1000, on the other hand, those who do not have a personal doctor or have limited access to him. There are 130,000 individuals.
The biggest deficit is among family doctors, which is the basis of health care. For several years now, the chamber has also noted: ""There are fewer applications for some other professions, which are mostly related to the hospital environment and belong to the so-called difficult, demanding medicine, to cite the example of intensive care, hematology, some surgical professions,"" said the president. Chamber Bojana Beović.
And how would a system that urgently needs solutions change political parties? Among other things, NSi envisages the abolition of concessions and the introduction of an independent healthcare provider. The Connect Slovenia movement states that public health care must mean the right to fast and efficient health care. The SDS intends to improve the quality of services, increase accessibility and ensure the competitiveness of Slovenian medicine. In the Svoboda movement, they are in favor of eliminating amphibians, and they would establish competition for the provision of health services until the queues decrease. The SD would stimulate additional work in a public health institution and the responsibility of health management. Even with the Left, we would abolish t. i. amphibians and strengthen public health with additional resources. The LMŠ would increase the attractiveness of the profession of family doctor by providing better working conditions. In the SAB, they increased the number of family doctors and improved working conditions.
This time, however, as medical societies note: ""We are a hatchery for rich countries,"" they added, ""the health care system will be successful in meeting the challenges of patient care only when we strengthen our staff enough to keep up with regular programs.""
The epidemic has exacerbated the problems of our health care that have been accumulating for years. In the show 24UR ZVEČER, the family doctor dr. Rok Ravnikar and dr. Luka Kovač from the Young Doctors Association.
'Greater employment flexibility needed'
Is the NSi proposal on independent health care providers a good solution? Will there be more family doctors because of this? ""The situation is so serious that the solution cannot be separated on the left or right, because in a sinking boat it doesn't matter which way you throw water from the boat. Flexibility of employment at the appropriate level is one of the things that have been identified as problematic in In other words, if young doctors had more forms of employment and cooperation, even in the most desirable direction, such as the profession of freelance doctor, this would undoubtedly attract a few more young doctors to the primary level than before, ""Ravnikar said.
We are all aware that healthcare is one of the foundations of our society. The 14 ministers who have changed in the last 14 years certainly do not contribute to the implementation of effective solutions in the field of health, Kovač added. ""I agree with Dr. Ravnikar's opinion that we need something different, especially flexibility, especially in the field of primary health care, because young people who grew up in a slightly different system and need different forms of labor law are entering the labor market or medicine itself."" He added that the 'free doctor' was not invented by them, but that it was an organization of work similar to most EU countries.
'If we want to keep young doctors, we need to take decisive and swift steps'
He pointed out that poor salaries, which the SAB points out, are not limited to family doctors. ""All doctors enter the profession on equal terms. Young doctors, ie specialists, we are young specialists, we could say, poorly paid. six years, his base salary is nine euros net per hour. ""
Ravnikar remarked that poor salaries are also indirectly one of the reasons why so few young people opt for family medicine. ""This is one of the more important aspects, although the salary of family doctors is never the first choice for choosing a specialization. However, this is one of the measures available to the state to try to influence young people's choices. If we want doctors to stay in Regardless of specialization, this is an area that will need to be regulated. We are in contact with neighboring EU countries where wage relations are clear. Young people have a free path and will go there. If we want to keep them for our patients, we will some concrete, decisive and swift steps need to be taken. ""
'The key problem is working conditions'
Kovač reiterated that the Young Doctors agree with the Fidesz union and demand an exit from the single wage system. ""Because Fidesz has recognized that this form is unacceptable for doctors in the current structure. It does not allow enough flexible remuneration, enough financial incentives for all or most young people to decide to stay in this system. And as we have shown in In our analysis of the case of Germany and the United Kingdom, the salaries of doctors in Slovenia are at least 20 to 30 percent too low, even if we take into account the GDP of Germany and the United Kingdom. ""
But how to encourage young people to opt for family medicine in greater numbers? Is it enough to just advertise more specializations and hope for the best? Of course not, Ravnikar answers, as the Medical Chamber and the Ministry have regularly advertised more places for family medicine for the last 10 years than was of interest. ""In the last 10 years, almost 600 vacancies for specialization in family medicine have remained unfilled. That is, there is no problem in tendering or restricting access to family medicine. The key problem is working conditions: overburdening and oversaturation with non-professional administrative and bureaucratic burdens. ""We are doing work that should be done by ZZZS representatives. These are not things that have made us study medicine."" He also noted that family doctors are often less valued among colleagues.
The flexibility of remuneration is greater for private individuals, should this be ensured in public institutions as well? Efficiency is certainly one of the important characteristics that every organization must follow, but in healthcare, which is somewhat specific here, quality and ensuring safe care for patients must come first, Kovač emphasized. ""At the same time, we will ensure safe and quality care by following the European directive of the 48-hour working day. This is one of the things that young doctors are increasingly emphasizing - to ensure that we limit working hours in the field of healthcare.""
'After who will be the Minister of Health, we will know how seriously the government is thinking'
How should our health care system be improved, what should be the first step of the new government, whatever it is? Kovač stated that according to the data of the Medical Chamber, between 2010 and 2020 he left Slovenia or about a thousand doctors did not continue their careers in medicine - some 500 graduates and another 400 doctors. This is about as many doctors as are needed to reach the European average. ""What we see as the fundamental measure we expect from the next government is, above all, stability. We need a stable minister and some clear goal that the governing policy should pursue.""
Ravnikar added that experience shows that it is not so much what the parties write in the programs, but who they will appoint as a minister. ""The fact that they were replaced by 20 in 20 years means that no political group has ever risked a strong political figure in the Ministry of Health, so the content has never been confronted with some solutions to such a complex system as health care. an important president of the coalition party of the future government has decided to be the Minister of Health, we will know that the next government is serious.

The mission will consist of several experts who are expected to arrive in Slovenia on 12 April. Their key task will be to examine individual elements of the electoral process or. various aspects of preparations for the elections.","Representatives of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) in Slovenia met in February with representatives of various ministries, courts, the ombudsman, parliamentary political parties, civil society, the media and some other interlocutors, including with DVK management. After the visit, the Office prepared a report of the mission to assess the needs for the April National Assembly elections in Slovenia, in which it recommends, among other things, the deployment of a mission to assess the April National Assembly elections.
According to the report, the ODIHR Needs Assessment Mission in principle trusts in electoral law and the professionalism, independence and impartiality of the competent electoral bodies. However, they think it makes sense to further assess certain other aspects of the electoral process, in particular the conduct of election campaigns and transparency. transparency of their financing, media coverage of elections and the media environment in general. Therefore, they recommended sending an election assessment mission to Slovenia.
In accordance with the Rules on Criteria, Conditions and Procedure for Obtaining Election Observation Accreditation, the application for obtaining election observation accreditation may be submitted by representatives of domestic and foreign organizations, institutions, associations and societies and international organizations dealing with elections, human rights protection. rights, integrity or education.

Yes, but not for those on Metelkova 6","In the first pre-election confrontation on our television, the vice-president of the SDS party, Aleš Hojs, stated that the current government had revoked the privileges that had caused tens or hundreds of millions to flow to NGOs at Metelkova 6. Are Hojs' claims true?","""However, we abolished privileges when tens, hundreds of millions poured into Metelkova 6 without any result. We abolished that,"" Aleš Hojs said in the pre-election confrontation.
There are more than 27,000 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Slovenia, representing interests in almost all areas of today's society. In 2020, NGOs with public funding (ministries, municipalities, public agencies, FIHO, FŠO and personal income tax donations) received 425 million euros, according to data from the Ministry of Public Administration (MPA). According to CNVOS, the umbrella network of Slovenian non-governmental organizations, NGOs received 416 million euros. The data differ slightly due to different methodologies (manual corrections of organizations set up by public law entities).
But at the address Metelkova ulica 6, which Hojs points out, only about 20 non-governmental organizations have their headquarters. According to Erar, in 2020 they received a total of just under four million euros in public funds.
Aleš Hojs' statement is not true. The CNVOS says Interior Minister Hoys is misleading. ""Hundreds of millions have never flowed into Metelkova 6, so they couldn't even abolish them."" The non-governmental organizations at Metelkova 6 say that they obtain funds for their activities through highly competitive public tenders in Slovenia and especially abroad. ""We have never received systemic funding from the state. We have noticed that individual ministries, especially the Ministry of Culture, have tried to harm us in public tenders and hinder our work, but we have not seen a significant decline in revenue over the past year."" We asked the Ministry of Culture to respond to the statement on the abolition of funds, but they did not respond until the article was published.
The Ministry of the Interior has prevented non-governmental organizations from applying for new tenders by introducing discriminatory conditions, CNVOS adds. ""The Legal Center for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, which previously provided free legal aid to applicants for international protection with public funds, was unable to re-apply for the tender after the project ended in 2020. It also remained without funds from the Ministry of Culture for example, the award-winning Maska Institute. ""
The Laibach Group and its umbrella Association for the Retro-Avant-Garde, which have production facilities on Metelkova, have never been systemically funded by the state, we were told. On several occasions, the Ministry of Culture financially supported one of the group's programs or international tours, but this support was not more than a few thousand euros in total. However, Minister Simoniti twice withheld (and never paid) extraordinary funds for major international projects under the treaties were donated by his ministerial predecessor, but even these funds were merely symbolic. "" In the last twelve years, they have received only 17,500 euros from the Ministry of Culture for various projects, and nothing at all in 2020, they add. ""In other words, Minister Vasko Simoniti withheld the financial assistance / extraordinary funds already agreed in the contract for an international project in the making, in the amount of 5,000 euros.""
The apple of controversy: the building on Metelkova ulica 6
The Ministry of Culture has been in dispute with 18 non-governmental organizations operating in the building at Metelkova 6 since 2020. The ministry, which owns the building, has called on NGOs that have been renting space there since 1996 to leave the building. This is said to be dangerous for tenants due to wear and tear. As the NGOs did not leave the building at the request of the Ministry, it filed a lawsuit against each organization separately.
For some organizations, the first-instance hearing has already been completed in favor of the ministry, and some are still awaiting trial. According to CNVOS, the lawsuit has already been lost by the Center for Slovenian Literature, which is expected to move out by the end of March this year. According to the Peace Institute, they will appeal the verdicts.
According to Hotel's statement, the organizations from Metelkova 6 believe that the efforts of the Ministry of Culture, which is trying to take away their premises, are part of a broader political showdown between the SDS party and non-governmental organizations and civil society. ""The fact that the current government is trying to harm non-governmental organizations that defend democratic values, equality and freedom of creation speaks volumes about the social damage they are causing. The statements of some other government officials, including its to the presidents who speak with contempt about the organizations at Metelkova 6 and try to blame us for a whole series of social problems for which they themselves are most responsible.

There is too much space, the auditors found in the 2014 and first nine months of 2015 audit - they are too big and / or empty. What has the Ministry of Public Administration, which became the manager of most state-owned real estate with a government decision in 2015, done to date to reduce unnecessary costs?","22 square meters for ministries and government services, police administrations, administrative units, local offices, 25 for geodetic administrations, 15 at border crossings: these are measures of the size of business space per workplace provided by the government (or the Minister of the Interior and Public administration Gregor Virant) in 2013 in the Standards for providing the necessary business and work space for the needs of the state.
For comparison: in the United States, the required area is set at 18, in the UK even at 13 square meters per workplace. The Court of Auditors therefore pointed out two things: that the average area for each job is 27.31 square meters - a quarter more than the 22nd, as specified in the Standards. Together, this means that the ministries with the inspectorates and the FURS have too much business space for almost 80,000 square meters. Which costs the state 5.7 million euros a year; if we add to this the cost of 63,000 square meters of unoccupied business premises, we come to the amount of 7.6 million: these are the calculations of the Court of Audit and so much the state paid per year for oversized and redundant premises.
Five years ago, the Court of Audit also drew attention to some cases of bad practices in state renting of premises, with the state in Postojna paying 13.55 euros per square meter for renting business premises, while the same state in the center of Ljubljana rents out premises 4.69 euros per square meter.
And therefore the recommendations of the auditors: the Ministry of Public Administration should prepare an analysis of the state of surplus real estate, determine the objectives of the management of these real estates and anticipate various possibilities of using these spaces.
And a good five years and three ministers later?
Since the publication of the audit report, the Ministry has been headed by Boris Koprivnikar, Rudi Medved and Boštjan Koritnik.
According to the Ministry of Public Administration, there are actually fewer unoccupied business premises than they found in the audit report, namely 31,150 and not 58,215 square meters. ""We cannot comment on the difference of up to 79,917 m2 of surplus business premises, as the report of the Court of Auditors refers to several budget users,"" they wrote. Among other things, there are more than 12,000 square meters of space at border crossings, which, according to the ministry, are not commercially interesting and are managed by the interior ministry.
Among other things, among the corrective measures of the Ministry of Public Administration, the report to the auditors lists:


Four indents for the same thing: uniform control over the management of state property, which cost 7.6 million a year due to inefficiency. Although the Ministry of Public Administration is the custodian of most state-owned real estate, we were told only by data for this ministry: that ""the volume of surplus space has decreased significantly in the last five years due to various activities (sales, renovations, management transfers""). almost none. ""
When the Lord comes
The landlord should save throwing money out the window: it is an application that would collect all the data on state real estate in one place. It should come to life, as the Ministry of Audit promised at the Ministry, by the first half of 2019.
Former Minister of Public Administration Rudi Medved signed a contract with the selected company NIL on 19 December 2018. Contract value: 673 thousand euros.
Today, a good three years later, the ministry's website reads: ""We are acting economically. We are renovating the central register of state-owned real estate.""
For almost six years. The set deadline, the first half of 2019, has long expired, the new one is the end of this year. When asked explicitly why it takes six and a half years to establish the Master, the ministry said:
""The basic module will be in use at the end of March 2022. Procedures for establishing production are currently underway. Since the beginning of the project in 2017, EUR 306,910.96 have been realized. The total funds allocated for the project amount to EUR 824,987.54, for which spending is planned by the end of the year, when the project is expected to be completed. ""
Time Machine
The current central register of state-owned real estate, to be replaced by the Master, is a story in itself: it was established, the ministry said, in 2008 - 14 years ago. And it’s outdated, they admit.
2008 is the year when the Social Democrats won the parliamentary elections with Borut Pahor; in the United States, the global financial crisis began, the worst since the Great Depression of 1929; war criminal Radovan Karadzic was arrested in Belgrade; Satoshi Nakamoto presented or. presented the idea of ​​bitcoin; and that was the year when Manchester United still won the Champions League and international football matches were played in Russia.
At that time, the Central Register of State-Owned Real Estate was established in Slovenia, which, despite the fact that 7.6 million flows out unnecessarily per year, is still the only central register of state-owned real estate."

This has brought us to a situation where, on the one hand, we are short of 30,000 public rental apartments and, on the other hand, we have 175,000 vacant properties, he said. We checked whether the data on vacant real estate in the country is true.","""In the last 30 years, the state has not implemented a housing policy. This has led us to a situation where, on the one hand, we lack 30,000 public rental apartments and, on the other, 175,000 vacant properties,"" said Left MP Miha Kordiš.
Data from the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS) show that in 2018, when the last official data on real estate occupancy were published, there were 152,280 vacant flats in the country.
The second data stated by SORS is that in 2018 there were 172,186 uninhabited dwellings in the country. But data on unoccupied and empty housing cannot be equated. Uninhabited real estate is both empty flats and “flats for seasonal or secondary use”, ie weekends. There were 19,896 of them in 2018.
Thus, according to SORS data, there are almost 23,000 fewer empty flats in Slovenia than the Levice MP states. The statement that there are 175,000 vacant properties in Slovenia is therefore not true.
In doing so, SORS defines an apartment as structurally separate and independent premises intended for the permanent residence of people. So it's about living space, not the type of property - a house, an apartment block, etc.
According to SORS, in 2018 the highest number of vacant flats was in the municipality of Ljubljana, namely 23,876, followed by Maribor (9494) and Koper (4941), and the lowest in the municipalities of Hodoš (35), Kobilje (57) and Odranci (70)."

During this time, the wage bill of civil servants increased by more than € 1 billion due to higher staffing, measures negotiated by public sector unions and the payment of obvious allowances. While the average public sector employee received 1,878.92 euros gross in 2018, in 2021 he already received 2,368.06 euros, which is almost 400 euros more.","According to the public sector wage portal, drawn on March 23, the number of public sector employees has increased by 10,015 since the last parliamentary elections until the end of last year. In June 2018, when the last parliamentary elections took place, 172,422 people were employed in the public sector, and in December 2021, 182,437. During the government of Marjan Šarc, until March 2020, the number of employees in the public sector increased by 4,600, and during the government of Janez Janša by 5,415.
The wage bill in the public sector has increased from € 325.1 million in June 2018 to € 418.8 million in December 2021, respectively. for 93.7 million.
In 2021, salaries in the public sector amounted to EUR 5.13 billion, ie an average of EUR 427.8 million of public money per month. In 2018, public sector wages amounted to 3.88 billion euros, an average of 323.6 million euros per month. The Ministry of Public Administration points out that the high growth of the wage bill in the public sector in some activities was mostly influenced by the settlements of certain retrospective payments, especially the settlements of obvious payments.
The average gross salary of an employee in the public sector amounted to almost 1,879 euros in 2018, and slightly more than 2,368 euros in 2021. According to the salary portal, allowances in the public sector increased from a total of 317.4 million in 2018 by more than half a billion, to just over 864 million euros.
Performance bonuses paid more than doubled during this time. From € 100.9 million in 2018, they jumped to just over € 220 million, the most between 2020 and 2021, when they increased by € 86.4 million.
Meanwhile, payments for incentives remained at about the same level - in 2018 they amounted to 1.3 million euros, and in 2021 1.4 million. Meanwhile, the mass of on-call payments has decreased. The state gave 21.9 million euros for this in 2018, and 14.7 million last year.
2730 more employees in healthcare, an additional 226.1 million euros for the state administration
The average number of employees in the state administration, which includes the government, ministries and constituent bodies and administrative units - the average number of employees increased by more than 300 between 2018 and 2021. While in 2018 the state administration employed 30,631 people , there were 30,938 in 2021, according to data from the Ministry of Public Administration.
During this time, the wage bill for employees in the state administration increased by EUR 226.1 million. While the salaries of employees in government services, ministries and administrative units in 2004 amounted to 746.3 million euros, in 2021 they amounted to 972.4 million euros.
In 2021, more than 3,000 additional people were employed in education and public institutions involved in sports. The wage bill in this group has increased by EUR 424.4 million in the last three years, ie between 2018 and 2021.
In 2021, there were 2,730 more employees in health care than in the previous three years, and the mass of salaries for health care jumped by 415 million euros. In social welfare, the number of employees increased by 851 and the wage bill by 86.6 million euros.
What public sector unions have managed to negotiate since the last parliamentary elections
The increase in the wage bill in the public sector during this time was not only influenced by additional employment, but also by the agreements reached between the government and the trade union side at the negotiating table.
Already at the beginning of her term, the government of Marjan Šarc ""inherited"" open negotiations with public sector unions, with which they reached an agreement in December 2018, worth 308 million euros annually.
Last year, the unions reached an agreement on the abolition of some austerity measures, ie under the Janša government. According to the Ministry of Public Administration, it weighs around 50 million euros annually.
In addition, in November 2021, the Minister of Health Janez Poklukar reached an agreement with representatives of trade unions in the field of health and social care. The deal, worth 37 million euros for social welfare and 86 million euros for health care on an annual basis, brought higher salaries to about 35,000 nursing staff, with hospital nurses raising the most, by three to six pay grades.
Then they contacted the Fides medical union and demanded their share of the cake. The government initialed an agreement worth 113.5 million euros with them - it brought doctors six salaries higher salaries and the possibility of ranking higher than the 57th salary grade, which is now reserved only for officials.
But this agreement, which was not even signed in the end - partly because of the Constitutional Court's decision, partly because of a different understanding of how long these measures were supposed to last - opened Pandora's box, as other public sector unions demanded what they wanted. negotiated by doctors. For 188,000 public sector employees, this would mean 1.5 billion euros higher wages on an annual basis. The unions with the latest demands have therefore failed.
710 million euros of obvious allowances paid to the public sector
However, allowances during the covida-19 epidemic also contributed to the wage bill in the public sector. From March 2020 to July 2021, a total of more than 710 million euros in co-paid allowances were paid to the public sector. The largest share of obvious allowances was paid to healthcare employees, almost 365 million euros. 129.7 million euros in paid allowances were paid in educational institutions, and 107 million euros to employees in ministries.
In the public sector, 174,640 employees received obvious allowances, ie almost all of them. On average, public sector employees received € 4,066.12 in obvious allowances. The record holder was a doctor employed at the University Clinical Center, who is also a lecturer at the Faculty of Medicine and received 81,125 euros in obvious supplements during the epidemic.
The table shows data on the largest allowances paid to one employee in the public sector, according to the field in which this record holder is employed.
These are various allowances - due to the danger and special burden during the epidemic, the allowance due to the temporary distribution or. relocations, for direct work with co-patients, for work in risky situations, etc. Employees in the ministries and in the constituent bodies mostly received allowances for working in risky situations."

This was asked by representatives of nine parties, business representatives, managers and innovative entrepreneurs. And they have handed over some concrete demands to the future government - whatever it may be. Among other things, a resolute ""no"" to political interference in the supervisory boards of companies and a resolute ""yes"" to the introduction of a development cap or tax relief for the richest.","The most recognizable and fastest growing economy in Europe and the society with the greatest prosperity. This is the vision of Slovenia as seen by the most influential Slovenian businessmen. ""We expect from politicians the ambition and connection shown by Slovenian athletes and entrepreneurs. We demand this from you,"" says Blaž Brodnjak from AmCham Slovenia. Tibor Šimonka, President of the Chamber of Commerce of Slovenia, adds: ""Without a proper competitive business environment, there will be no prosperity or social welfare in this country."" ""Solutions must be good for the state, for the well-being of citizens, not only for those who are in the party or who are obedient to the party,"" said Andrej Božič from the Manager's Association.
Representatives of nine political parties were given the opportunity to present their answers to the most pressing socio-economic issues nine times today, but they always returned to one topic: without tax relief for the highest salaries, we can forget about Slovenia's development breakthrough. ""I am skeptical about digitalisation if it means decentralization of the state. If it means a unified information system in the public sector or in healthcare, of course I support it. coordinator of the Left.
""I can not pass the Provokations of Luka Mesca, which always provokes that the development cap is harmful. These holy war, leading to the development cap, is extremely harmful to Slovenia and was the time to tell him that the Slovenian company is one of the most egaliters, ""says Matej Tonin, president of NSi.
Another hot topic: staffing in state-owned companies. This time, the current government was under attack by businessmen.
Žiga Vavpotič from Outfit7 said: ""Dear Sirs, if your general secretaries continue to be the main staff of supervisory boards, then we will certainly not have people there who understand what digitalisation is, and thus we will never lead the Slovenian economy to the necessary breakthroughs. ""
Therefore, it is high time for a large programmatic, not ideologically colored coalition, the businessmen concluded."

As the list's champion Boris Popovič pointed out at the press conference, they are also convinced that Slovenia needs serious health, school, financial and pension reform.","According to Popovič, the Boris Popovič List - Digitize Slovenia is a new central party in the political space that knows and is able to implement a unifying program ""with the goal of an effective legal and democratic state where each individual can realize his talents, visions and dreams for his own future"".
According to him, the program is based on the concrete wishes and needs of young, enterprising and innovative Slovenes who would like to become proud of their homeland again.
Among the key points of the program, the lists state the return of democracy to the country. According to Popovic, the first, symbolic step in this direction would be to sell the water cannon immediately. Otherwise, they will also strive to ensure fair elections that reflect the true will of the electorate. This would be achieved by introducing e-elections.
Among the priorities of the Popovič program is the modernization of the economy, and Slovenia is convinced that it must become one of the leading development countries. Therefore, they will also strive to attract foreign high-tech companies to the country, and according to him, Slovenia will become the crypto capital of the world.
They will advocate for tax cuts, the construction of a third development axis and a high-speed double-track railway
As Popovič points out, Slovenia has a tax-unfriendly environment, so they will advocate lowering taxes. At the same time, young self-employed people would be supported with benefits, and the state would exempt young people from paying all contributions for the first two years, and half of all contributions for the next two years. In the long run, they will also advocate the introduction of a universal basic income.
The program also includes advocacy for the construction of the third development axis and high-speed double-track railway, owner's non-profit housing without a deposit, shortening queues in healthcare, lean e-government, development of five-star tourism with high added value, normalization of income tax scale, development of tourist connections and fair and effective rule of law.
Popovič emphasizes that he is running in the elections because he is not satisfied with the current government, just as he was not satisfied with the previous ones. The former mayor of Koper is convinced that his past political career on the way to crossing the parliamentary threshold will not hinder him.
He expects a result in the elections that will bring the list to parliament. As he answers, he would like to see himself in the mandate position, but he emphasizes that the final decision will be made by the voters. However, he claims that, although these are two extreme political options that are not close to him, he is ready to talk to both the current Prime Minister Janez Janša and the president of the Svoboda Movement, Robert Golob, after the elections.
They appealed to the Supreme Court against the rejection of the paper
Boris Popovič's lists rejected the candidacy in the Ptuj constituency. Namely, the list did not meet the legally prescribed 35% gender quota, as there were too few male candidates on it. According to Popovič, the rejection of their list was a misunderstanding, so they appealed the decision of the electoral commission to the Supreme Court. According to the information of the electoral commission of the Ptuj constituency, the senate of the Supreme Court will decide on this on Thursday.
Although in the previous elections the list of candidates was rejected mainly due to the insufficient number of female candidates, this is not the first case when the list did not meet this legal condition due to the lack of male candidates. This happened four years ago, when the Democratic Party of Labor and Sloga list was rejected in one of the constituencies.
Boris Popovič's list was initially rejected in the Ljubljana - Center constituency. As Popovič explained at today's presentation of the list's program, the reason was the inconsistency of the party's internal acts, but the supreme judges found that this was not the case and returned the matter to the electoral commission for reconsideration, which later changed the original decision."

At the first pre-election confrontation on POP TV, the guests spoke about the war in Ukraine, the food and energy crisis, the epidemic, about what to expect after the election. Robert Golob, who has so far failed to confront Janez Janša, does not believe this is a coincidence and hopes it will happen soon.
Luka Mesca is annoyed that politics has become such a theater: ""We're watching a reality show."" Tanja Fajon was harsh that the current government had taken away people's dignity, and Matej Tonin reassured that there was no room for resentment in politics. Aleš Hojs defended the deleted tweet about refugees. Alenka Bratušek pointed out that Slovenia is historically indebted. Marjan Šarec announces the normalization of the situation, and Zdravko Počivalšek announces cooperation with everyone.
The Facts team analyzed the credibility of the statements after the confrontation. Several statements are not true about the country's public debt, the country's health successes in the face of an apparent crisis, and the price of electricity before and after the departure of Robert Golob from the Gen-I summit.
2. CONFRONTATION
At the second pre-election confrontation on POP TV, our guests spoke about the outcome of the elections in Hungary and Serbia, about resolving the energy crisis, housing issues, political communication and post-election cooperation.
The confrontation was marked by sharp word exchanges. Jernej Vrtovec promised that no one would be cold next winter, and Robert Golob warned that the consequences of the crisis would be borne by industry. Tanja Fajon estimated that energy vouchers are just 'late firefighting', while Marjan Šarec pointed out the problem of reducing network charges.
Romana Tomc promised the young people that the state would help them take out loans, while Alenka Bratušek would limit market rents. Alojz Kovšca emphasized the need to cooperate with everyone, and according to Luka Mesca, the Left will ensure that the coalition agreement is not a dead letter.
Once again, the Facts team checked live the statements of eight party representatives who, according to the two most recent Mediana opinion polls, show them the best for our media house.

NSi ensures that they are a party with clear values. The government's program for the future is divided into fourteen areas, which provide clear answers to the challenges of the future: ""We are convinced that everyone needs freedom to fully develop their talents. The task of the state is to provide encouraging and a stable environment. ""

Stable energy supply at affordable prices will separate successful countries from less successful ones, they estimate and emphasize that self-sufficiency with quality food for Slovenian farmers is becoming increasingly important. They promise quality infrastructure: ""A modern road and railway network will be the backbone of Slovenia's future development.""
They ensure that they do not forget the weak and vulnerable: ""Regulated long-term care, decent wages and pensions are building blocks of a prosperous state. At the same time, we need more social justice. The justice system must give people a sense of the rule of law. cheating. ""

The initiative emphasizes that these are ""false, insulting and manipulative"" statements. All parties had the opportunity to express their views on civil society issues.","The Voice of the People initiative responded to statements by Prime Minister Janez Jansa, prominent SDS members and the government's official Twitter profile, which they said were trying to discredit the Voice of the People civic initiative and their field campaign to encourage voter turnout.
The initiative believes that it is a ""coordinated campaign of discrediting the highest state representatives"", accusing them of violating the law, making fun of the law, conducting a campaign for certain political parties, reporting the campaign to the Court of Auditors and cost taxpayers € 70 million.
The initiative rejects the accusations and emphasizes that the primary goal of their activities in Slovenia is to increase voter turnout. This is more than 70% in neighboring countries, but barely exceeds 50% in Slovenia, they warned.
Director of the Legal Center for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment Katarina Bervar Sternad said that 138 questions or the demands of civil society, which were forwarded to the political parties participating in the elections, were prepared by more than 110 non-governmental organizations and thousands of individuals. According to Bervar Sternadova, the demands reflect expectations about what kind of Slovenia we want to live in. “The right to vote is not something that goes without saying,” she said, and not exercising that right is not, in her view, a protest but a surrender.
Tea Jarc, president of the Mladi plus union, said they did not agree to these accusations and intimidation. According to her, the Voice of the People campaign is intended to inform the public ""so that people get to know the content of the parties"". She emphasized that this was not a propaganda of one party or one political option, but that all parties had the opportunity to participate both in the submission of their views on these demands and in the Volitvomat application. All political parties had the same opportunities, she said, ""but some parties, despite several calls, did not want to take this opportunity.""

""The National Assembly Elections Act stipulates that voters who are unable to go to the polls due to illness must notify the district election commission no later than three days before election day,"" they explained, adding that the law ""unfortunately does not allow exceptions."" . Voters are advised to take part in early elections if they have the opportunity.","In recent days, many citizens have addressed the National Electoral Commission (DVK) with questions about how those voters who fall ill after April 20, when the statutory deadline for submitting an application to vote at home, will be able to vote. ""The National Assembly Elections Act stipulates that voters who are unable to go to the polls due to illness must notify the district election commission no later than three days before the day of voting. This provision does not apply only to those who will be infected. with coronavirus in isolation, but also for those who will have another disease during the election or will be sent to a hospital, nursing home, etc., for example, ""they say on DVK.
Due to warnings from the medical profession, the DVK withdrew from the agenda at the last session the decision on the proposal to allow voters who will be sent into isolation after the deadline for submitting an application to vote at home to vote at the polling station. ""The argument of the Ministry of Health, the advisory group for covid-19 at the Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) is that there are no exceptions for voters in isolation, except for an urgent visit to the doctor, and they must not leave their residence.

Voters are therefore suggested that, if they have the opportunity, they take part in the early voting, which will take place from Tuesday, 19 April, to Thursday, 21 April, between 7 am and 7 pm.

The number of infections is currently slightly increasing (according to the NIJZ, there are currently approximately 38,925 active cases of infections in Slovenia). At the moment, it is not possible to predict how many adult citizens will be in isolation due to the infection on election day.
They also pointed out that in all elections there is a certain number of voters who are unable to participate in the elections because they fall ill after the statutory deadline for submitting an application to vote at home. Anyone who falls ill in the April National Assembly elections on Thursday, Friday, Saturday or election Sunday (April 21-24) will not be able to vote. However, it is not just about voters in isolation due to coronavirus infection. It can happen, for example, that a voter has to go to a hospital or home for the elderly just before the election, or on the day of the election he becomes so ill that he cannot go to the polls.

Zdravko Počivalšek is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Development and Technology, Marjan Dikaučič is the Minister of Justice, Simona Kustec is the Minister of Education, and Boštjan Koritnik is the Minister of Public Administration.
According to Počivalšek, the ideological division of Slovenian politics has been stifling Slovenia's development potential for decades, and instead of finding common ground and connecting, most of politics is becoming more and more radical and polarized.
Počivalšek spoke for our portal in an extensive pre-election interview.

Connecting Slovenia is a movement for common sense, they say of themselves: ""We are cooperating with people who have different views and were once even political opponents. Political agreements are not easy, but discussions allow us to learn cooperation and tolerance. Slovenian political space. It is important to compete for good ideas, not to find differences. We are not talking about connecting, cooperating and finding optimal solutions, but we are living it. We want to turn Slovenia into a country of cooperation. ""
It follows from their program that they want to establish an alliance between Slovenian farmers and Slovenian consumers, which provides quality food to consumers and a decent life for farmers, and in case of emergency, this alliance is a guarantee that no one will go hungry. According to their proposal, over 300 million euros, which are spent annually on food in kindergartens, schools, hospitals, other public institutions, the army and other state institutions, should be given priority to food produced in Slovenia. They plan to intervene in health care: ""Without comprehensive change and unification of the organization, long-term personnel planning and transparency in the health care system, for the first time in history, our life expectancy will be reduced due to unnecessary deaths."" The Green Passage should not punish the poorest, they warn, adding that pensioners must not fall into poverty. They suggest that widows and widowers, after the loss of a partner, maintain such a share of his pension that they can secure a decent life.
A government group would be set up to review all new laws and amendments to laws in terms of the needs of young individuals and families.
They are also concerned about hate speech and restrictions on free speech: ""Never restrict speech by the authorities. In recent years, there have been growing tendencies to control increasingly offensive speech in public. But if we restrict speech, its suitability will always be decided by As freedom of speech is too important for society's ability to find the most optimal solutions and change and correct injustices, the Connect Slovenia movement is committed to not supporting any tightening of current legislation in this area. ""

""Even in this confrontation, politicians have not avoided false statements about refugees. According to Facts expert Dr Sam Bardutzki, this is sad and worrying, as untruths encroach on human rights and shape the unfortunate fate of individuals. indebtedness and inflation were deprived in such a way that they corresponded to a specific policy, which is out of context, as economist Dr. Miha Dominko points out, misleading and incomprehensible, ""describes the editor of Facts, Alenka Marovt.

Golob, who has not yet managed to confront Janša, does not believe that this is a coincidence, and hopes that this will happen soon. Mesca is bothered that politics has become such a theater and “we’re watching a reality show”. Fajon is harsh that the current government has taken away people's dignity, Tonin is reassured that there is no room for resentment in politics. Hojs defends a deleted tweet about refugees. Bratuškova points out that Slovenia is historically indebted. Šarec announces the ""normalization"" of the situation, while Počivalšek predicts cooperation with everyone.","With the confrontation of the presidents of the parties, which are ranked the best by public opinion polls, the pre-election campaign before the National Assembly elections also started in our media house.
We invited the presidents of the SDS parties, the Freedom Movement, the Social Democrats, the Left, Nova Slovenija, LMŠ, SAB and Connect Slovenia. Prime Minister Janez Janša traveled to Zagreb, and was replaced by SDS Deputy Prime Minister Aleš Hojs.
The topics they talked about are the most current: How to end the suffering in Ukraine as soon as possible and what can Slovenia do about it? And the consequences of the war in Ukraine, both for our security and for our pockets. How to limit price increases? About the coronavirus: will we emerge victorious or defeated as a society and as a country? Who will lead Slovenia for the next four years, what type of leader does Slovenia need in these difficult times? And what can we expect immediately after the election. What kind of coalitions are possible at all?
'We are watching a reality show, an episode in Kiev could mean a selfie in Kiev'
According to opinion polls, Robert Golob is the biggest rival of SDS and Janez Janša, but they have not faced each other so far. As he says, he does not believe in coincidences. “It’s definitely a plan,” he said. However, he hopes that Janša will gather courage and take part in some confrontation. Aleš Hojs defended his ""boss"" and said that Janša's trip to Zagreb was more important than participating in the show on our television and that there would definitely be a confrontation between them.
What do our guests think about sending a Slovenian diplomatic mission to Kyiv? ""Having the Prime Minister consult with everyone on this would pose an additional security risk, so it is right that he did so in strict secrecy,"" Hoys said. Tanja Fajon pointed out that such solo and heroic actions lead to additional conflicts. Matej Tonin said that Slovenia is not the only country that has a diplomatic mission there and does exactly what other countries do. ""She is an active member of the international community and we need to get this smallness out of our heads. We are doing what we need to do at the moment."" He is convinced that this is about creating internal political hysteria. Zdravko Počivalšek supported Janša's move, as ""the goal is peace as soon as possible"". Luka Mesec: ""It bothers me that politics has become such a theater. I'm sorry to watch a reality show, an episode in Kiev could be called 'sefie in Kiev'. All we watch is that the government is looking for ways to she will show that she is saving the world, while she did not know how to save Slovenia. "" He wants games like this to end after April 24th. Alenka Bratušek reminded that the trip to Kyiv is not the only solo action of this government. ""Solo actions are bad, they harm Slovenia and do not bring a solution to the Ukrainian crisis,"" she said. She reiterated that Janša could invite his friend Orban to go to Moscow and try to persuade the one who can actually end the war. ""Only a united world can lead to peace. Peace is the only solution we must pursue, solo actions do not help,"" Golob is convinced. Marjan Šarec said that Slovenia, as part of the EU and NATO, is pursuing a common policy and that is its role. ""It is not the role of our Prime Minister to provoke, get involved in the conflict and expose Slovenia to additional dangers. His task is to protect the citizens.""
Janez Janša's statement that airspace over Ukraine should be closed was similarly upsetting. Golob jokingly wonders how Slovenia will close its airspace over Ukraine, as it ""has nothing to contribute"". A ban on flights means a direct declaration of war, he is convinced, and this must be prevented. According to him, an initiative to establish humanitarian corridors on earth would be more useful. Hojs pointed out that Janša is the only one of the current presidents in the EU who has direct experience with the war. The initiative to close the airspace is in play all the time, he says. Mesec thought that Janša knew very well that NATO would not take him into account and that he was only drawing attention to himself with such statements. ""We want a prime minister who will think faster than a tweet!""
'The fence at the border is the biggest shame in the history of Slovenia'
One of the sad consequences of the war in Ukraine is the crowds of refugees. We have announced that we can accept up to 200,000 of them in Slovenia, so far we have accepted 7,000 of them. Will Slovenia be open to refugees from now on, or are Ukrainians an exception because they are culturally, historically and religiously close to us, as stated in a government tweet that was later deleted?
Hoys reiterated that this claim is a fact, although many would like it to be denied. """" The truth was written there! ""Asked why the tweet was then deleted, he did not answer.
Golob announces the removal of the fence from the Slovenian-Croatian border. Does this mean an open door policy for all refugees? The pigeon replied that a man in need is a man and this is the principle they uphold. The residents themselves who lived there once wanted the fence for safety, but now they say the fence is not working and they want to remove it as soon as possible. Mesec also says that the fence should be removed from the border because the distinction between refugees is ""ordinary racism"" and the fence at the border is ""the greatest shame in the history of Slovenia"". Počivalšek warned that we should not confuse economic migrants and refugees. ""We are open to refugees, and rules must apply to economic migrants,"" he said. However, he is also in favor of removing the fence from the southern border. Fajon says she would tear down the fence and arrange legal immigration routes. However, Hojs announced that they would not demolish anything in the SDS in the next term. Šarec reminded that we have a panel fence and cutting wire, which is completely inhumane in these times and must be removed immediately. Tonin said the fence is designed to prevent illegal migration and if we remove it, it will move to some other border. Bratuškova said that the government divides people into first-class and second-class people in Slovenia, not only among refugees. And even the tweet that Hoys “happily repeats from confrontation to confrontation is inadmissible”. “By doing so, they show a picture and an attitude towards people,” she said.
On the management of the covida-19 health crisis
They also talked about resolving the health crisis due to covida-19. While current representatives of government parties acknowledge that they could work better in certain areas, such as communication, they point out that Slovenia emerged from this crisis as a winner in the economic field, as Zdravko Počivalšek said, praising the economic growth of Slovenia after the corona crisis. According to Alenka Bratušek, the government took advantage of this crisis, and they did well in filling the pockets of their friends.
The price of a bad fight against the epidemic was paid the most by retirees in the DSO and schoolchildren who had closed schools, he says. However, we have a long way to go for our supposed economic performance, as this economic growth is based on borrowing, which is not healthy economic growth, she pointed out. Tanja Fajon also agreed that our debt will give us a headache. Šarec said that politics came together during the lockdown, and the government then lost confidence with the PKP underlings. Golob pointed out that the current government first removed the profession in management, thus wasting people's trust.
On the newly adopted Personal Income Tax Act
Tonin and Počivalšek emphasized that with the new personal income tax law, all citizens receive higher salaries, but that the other political pole, which opposes this, wants to take it back immediately. Golob said that they will definitely change this law, because it makes them more wealthy than he admits, and citizens with lower contributions, who in his opinion really need it, but this law brings little struggle. As Fajonova also pointed out, this law deepens the differences: ""Of course, everyone wants higher salaries, those with a minimum income will have 13 euros more, and those with 40,000 euros gross will have 15,000 euros more. So those who have more, they will have even more. We would tax progressively. "" Šarec points out that it sounds nice that we will all have higher salaries, but the budget will suffer 800 million euros in damage. ""Such a clever measure can only be treated as a pre-election candy,"" Šarec assessed the government's move to adopt the personal income tax law. We will all have to face this law, he says.
Candidates on the food and energy crisis in Europe
The attack on Ukraine has exacerbated the energy and food crisis in Europe. Food prices are the highest in the last 20 years. From the beginning of February 2002 to the end of February 2022, they increased by more than 73 percent. What measures would candidates take in this area?
For the most part, the candidates agree to increase Slovenia's share of self-sufficiency and food independence. According to Golob, they would selectively lower VAT prices for some basic foods. Tonin emphasized that we should first of all change the way of thinking that it pays to buy from the local market, more needs to be done to encourage the sale of products from Slovenian manufacturers, he said. Bratušek replied that more Slovenian food should be produced the most.
The month advocates food and energy self-sufficiency. He emphasizes that dependence on fossil fuels in particular needs to be addressed. After the crown crisis, more needs to be produced at home, he points out. In my opinion, the state can help the poorest at the income level to correct the lowest incomes for these groups. Šarec believes that the most important thing is to ensure dietary independence from others. Food subsidies may also be needed in the short term if there is no other solution. In the long run, we must not forget the investments in irrigation systems due to drought and frost that Slovenia is facing, he reminded.
Who would work with whom?
The first tasks of the new government will be the normalization of the situation in the country and the return of democracy, the LMŠ predicts. Šarec says that the first measure is for everyone in the government to respect the law and be responsible for their mistakes. The second move is an audit of all personnel moves and transactions. ""What will be the difference from the government they were already in?"" The difference will be that the next government will be a majority and no longer a minority. We will all be at the same table, taking our share of responsibility, ""he announced.
Golob emphasized that they are already in contact with civil society and will remain so. ""Not us, the voice of the people is preparing systemic legislation that will eliminate the harmful measures of this government. We will support them. We will not write the legislation ourselves. We believe in the people,"" he pointed out. He added that 60 percent of voters want a different society - open, free, respectful, solidary. ""If we get a mandate, it will be clear - we need to lead to such a society."" He sees four potential partners in the studio for this. ""After the government, we will go into a coalition not only with the KUl, but also with civil society,"" he announced.
""We want respect. This government has taken away the dignity of the people, we are doing things differently,"" Fajon said. According to her, the prime minister-designate will be nominated by those who gather a sufficient number of votes and seats in parliament. ""I see four great allies here!"" She herself advocates a policy of dialogue, inclusion and cooperation, but does not see the possibility of cooperating with the parties of the current government coalition.
Tonin believes that there is no room for resentment in politics. ""The future government will have to be future-oriented, firm, with its own vision and not deal with itself or revenge. The more one is excluded, the more narrow the room for some normal cooperation. People will have to be taken care of and NSi is always present in such governments, ""he said.
""I always say that we will talk to everyone and agree with those who are ready to move on,"" said Počivalšek.
Bratuškova added that there are brave and reliable people in the SAB party who have not and will never betray their voters. That is why they signed an agreement with KUL some time ago. ""We are ready to work with such people in the future."" She is convinced of a strong center-left government.
The month says that they have two main goals in the elections - to change the government and come to the government with the Left. They want to be the party that will be the ""guarantor"" of not getting another Miro Cerar government, but a government that will do what it agrees to do. They are willing to compromise, he asserted.
Hojs, however, concluded that they are currently focused on the election campaign and reckon they will be relative winners. Janša will certainly invite all parties to the talks, but he personally would exclude the Left, because ""they are so different that they do not belong to any coalition"". ""But we will wait to see if what they say in KUL will come true, so if all four parties will cross the parliamentary threshold.""
We checked the truthfulness and authenticity of the statements of the party presidents during the confrontation, and the results were published on our website 24ur.com - in the Facts section and in the show 24UR ZVEČER.
The next confrontation will be scheduled in a week, on Monday, April 4, also starting at 8 pm on POP TV.
The next poll will be released on Sunday, April 10th."

The list includes candidates from both parties as well as those from the Alliance for Dolenjska and the SOS Movement. Last weekend, the latter expressed their support for both parties or the joint lists Our Future and Good State.","In the paper Our Future and Good State, they advocate the establishment of a citizen-friendly system for controlling the use of public money. ""We need to establish a system where each of us can easily check the use of public funds with a few clicks online. Less corruption means more funds for health, social services, education, youth and homes for the elderly,"" they said in a press release.
The joint list includes 36 candidates and 42 candidates.
Among the more prominent or in the past more exposed to the media are: IVAN GALE, president of the Our Future party SMILJAN MEKICAR, president of the Dobra državamag party.

""We see our electorate in all those who have overlooked the manipulations that have taken place in the last two years and have yet to see an end to them,"" they wrote. In their opinion, most of the problems facing Slovenia are the result of non-transparency and corruption. ""The biggest enemy of corruption, however, is transparency in the use of public funds,"" they commented.
""According to international organizations in Slovenia, we lose more than three billion euros every year due to corruption. That is enough to build 30 new pediatric clinics every year. Or six new university clinical centers or 150 nursing homes every year. 500 new gyms, ”they point out.
That is why, in their opinion, corruption is one of the key problems in Slovenia's development. ""It's about the money of all citizens, so we must do everything we can to end this practice,"" they said. In addition to fighting corruption, the list aims to achieve social justice and end environmental indifference. They advocate sustainable development, an open knowledge and innovation society based on trust, equality and justice.
They will advocate for: • a rule of law that will effectively take care of the ""little man"", • transparency, which is the greatest enemy of corruption and nepotism, • freedom of speech and a new media law, • self-sufficiency at all levels, • professional and capable staff instead of politically oriented ones to gain transparent and efficient public institutions • reorganization and transparency and accessibility of health care.
One of the key priorities of the program is self-sufficiency
According to these parties, due to the current situation in the world, social security is becoming an increasing problem. ""We believe in an active community and at the same time we are committed to providing socio-economic stability to the individual who is the building block of the latter. In this way, he can become an active citizen who can influence decisions that directly affect us all,"" they say.
As they say, self-sufficiency, which is one of the key priorities of their draft program proposal, also has a direct impact on social security. ""It is inadmissible that pre-election chocolates are known mainly in the pockets of the wealthy, and that the distribution of these funds is neither proportional nor fair,"" they wrote, adding that Slovenia will become a welfare state when all individuals are guaranteed a decent life. according to their status. The quality of society is most reflected in relation to the most vulnerable groups, they add. That is why, as they add, in the care of the welfare state, it is necessary to ensure solidarity with various vulnerable groups, from low-income families, the unemployed, pensioners, precarious workers and other marginalized groups.
They also emphasize the importance of freedom of speech
As a second key priority, they highlight freedom of speech, which must become a value directly related to media freedom. ""The new legislation must primarily adequately protect journalists and domestic media from politics and media concentration. Various attempts at subordination, limiting media activities such as staffing on RTV, stopping STA funding, purchases of domestic media by foreign political allies, become just a bad memory, ”they insist.
""Vaccination with covid-19 vaccines is solely a matter of individual decision""
One of the more pressing issues of public interest is certainly the issue of compulsory vaccination in connection with covid-19. ""The fact is that a lot of damage has been done, so any debate about compulsory vaccination or coercion to vaccinate with vaccines that have not passed standard procedures and safety protocols is harmful and therefore unacceptable,"" they are convinced.
That is why they point out that vaccination with such vaccines is solely a matter of individual decision. ""As this is a highly polarizing topic, we will actively advocate for a broad and respectful public debate. As such vaccination is currently included in the compulsory vaccination scheme, our position is the need for a broader professional and public debate based on arguments and evidence, not relationships. power, ”they add.
""The key issue in these elections will also be what kind of society we want to become. Public discourse in all areas must be raised to a decent and tolerant level in order to become a model of a responsible and democratic society,"" they concluded."

For now, the candidate list of the Alliance for the Liberation of Slovenia in the constituencies Ljubljana - Bežigrad and Ljubljana - Center has been rejected. The latter also rejected the List of Boris Popovič, who appealed the decision, but according to our information, the Supreme Court granted it.","The Alliance for the Liberation of Slovenia candidate list was rejected in the mentioned constituencies because the name of the joint candidate list did not show that it was a joint list of two or more political parties, as required by law, the National Electoral Commission (DVK) explained.
Boris Popovič's list was rejected in the Ljubljana - Center constituency because it was submitted with too few signatures of voters who have registered permanent residence in this constituency.

At the time, the program emphasized the belief that the struggle for socialism could not be limited to the political system, but must cover all spheres of social life. The coordinator of the Left is Luka Mesec.","Representatives of the Left are entering the election campaign with a clear goal: to change the government and offer concrete solutions so that our common future will be socially secure, democratic and ecological again, they emphasize.
The period before the start of the campaign was varied for the party, as Vili Kovačič filed an initiative to assess the unconstitutionality of the Left program and its operation, accusing them of controversial points mentioned in the 2017 program. companies into the hands of the state and local communities. The Constitutional Court rejected the initiative.
Coordinator Mesec spoke for our portal in an extensive pre-election interview.

With a real plan of large-scale construction, they will provide young people with housing that is the human right of all, not the luxury of the lucky few.

They predict decisive action against the climate and environmental crisis: ""Over the next two governments, we will have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% compared to 2005. The climate transition must be fair."" Their economy would be ""tailor-made"": ""We will encourage the participation of workers in management and forms of workers' ownership of companies."" They are committed to investing in development and combating poverty and social exclusion. We would raise social transfers to a level that allows us to survive and tackle the transmission of poverty from generation to generation. From the system of cash social benefits, we would gradually develop a system of basic income.

When she took office, she said she expected more cooperation and integration in the center-left of the political space.","The Social Democrats are an advanced political movement that implements the idea of ​​social democracy in 21st century Slovenia. We connect and organize people into a strong political force capable of creating progressive change.

Fajonov sees a natural ally in the Freedom Movement. She said they share ""the same values ​​and the same desire to change the government, make a fresh start and return people to normalcy"".

Alenka Bratušek with like-minded people, ministers, deputies and other founding members. They adopted a social-liberal program. In 2018, the party entered the government of Marjan Šarc, winning three ministerial posts. After the resignation of Marjan Šarc from the post of Prime Minister, the party joined the opposition.","""We are not promising a € 1,000 pension or a € 2,000 salary, we are not talking about ethics and morals, but this is how we live and work! We are not a new immaculate face in politics that will disappoint again, as it did in the last three elections, we We are building on experience and working. We are also making a mistake that is not difficult for us to apologize for. We are not saying that they will just strain honey and milk, but we promise hard and honest work to make Slovenia a successful and respected country again. "" they say in the party.
The president of the Bratušek party spoke for our portal in an extensive pre-election interview.
She also answered 10 quick questions that try to distract politicians from some key political and social areas.

The ""Do What You Need"" program is based on four pillars: urgent priorities, key projects, solidarity and green transformation.
Respect for all citizens, stabilization of public finances, restoration and consolidation of the rule of law, strengthening public and independent media, restoring Slovenia's international reputation, democratic co-decision-making, improving the situation of pensioners and professional management of the epidemic were listed as urgent priorities.
According to Bratušek, pensioners have a special place in the SAB election program. ""We need to ensure the stability of the pension fund, which is an agreement for the future. Its stability is a condition for young people to believe that they will receive pensions in 30 or 40 years,"" she said.
Climate change must also be taken into account when formulating economic policy, they warn. According to them, the transition to green energy production is becoming a reality and a priority, as well as the focus on the transition to e-mobility and much attention to public transport as the main backbone of transport and the transition to a neutral environmental policy. ""We will actively advocate for the EU's leading role in tackling climate change and in pursuing sustainable development, and we will demand that other countries respect the Paris Agreement and propose the appointment of a special EU Commissioner for Climate Change.""
They are in favor of stabilizing public finances: ""Financial independence and low indebtedness are important conditions for the state to be independent and sovereign. The highest public debt in Slovenia's history, laws with high financial consequences for the state budget in the next term The re-enactment of the fiscal rule requires sober and prudent measures by the future government. after the end of the covida-19 crisis, during which the fiscal rule did not apply and the debts of countries within the EU increased significantly. ""
They also point out the area of ​​internal affairs: ""Slovenia needs a politically independent and autonomous police. Party incursions and staffing have ruined the reputation and ability to prosecute crime and control corruption, which has grown in the last two years. Prosecution of corruption and crime has a significant impact on confidence and the state, because it gives people the feeling that we are all really equal before the law. The police must give priority to ensuring the safety of all citizens. ""

It has grown on the basis of the aspirations of thousands of Slovene patriots and democrats, by combining the ideas and strengths of members, supporters and sympathizers, through ups and downs remain faithful to its program, the principles of parliamentary democracy and constitutional values, ""they added.
The upcoming elections will be groundbreaking and those in which we will decide what kind of Slovenia we live in, the party emphasizes before the elections.
In its umbrella program, the party emphasizes that development, as understood by the SDS, includes the human dimension, which includes quality and longevity in all respects, individual rights and responsibilities with active and free involvement in all key social subsystems, participation in creation and enjoying the material and spiritual wealth of society; the cultural dimension, which offers the individual and society a source of belonging, identity, fundamental values ​​and norms both within the Slovenian nation and within the broader framework of European and Western civilization; the social dimension, which means strengthening interpersonal trust, cooperation and solidarity and requires a balance between modern individualism and inclusion in modern national and other communities; the political dimension, which includes the continuous strengthening and deepening of democracy from the local through the national to the European transnational level, respect for and protection of the acquis, ensuring political efficiency and transparency; the economic dimension provided by a free market economy within regulated legal and ethical-social frameworks.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/lms_3.html,LMS,"The Marjan Šarc List (LMŠ) was established in May 2014 on the initiative of Marjan Šarc. The reason for the establishment was the upcoming local elections, as Šarec was initially active in local politics. In 2017, Šarec ran in the presidential elections, where he recorded high support, which then spilled over into the National Assembly elections, which took place in spring 2018. Marjan Šarec became Prime Minister, and after his resignation, after March 13, 2020, LMŠ became opposition party.","This is the second time that the party is running in the National Assembly elections, also this time under the leadership of Marjan Šarc, who was given a new mandate at the helm of the party on 19 March 2022 at the Electoral Congress.
The president of the Šarec party spoke for our portal in an extensive pre-election interview.
He also answered 10 quick questions that try to take a politician's view of some key political and social areas.

The party adopted the work plan for the period 2022-2026 at the party congress on November 27, 2021. ""With our program we clearly set the guidelines as a central development-oriented liberal party that wants to work for the wider good and care for the development of society as a whole."" confirmation of the program said Šarec.
According to Šarc, the first task after the elections will be normalization and return to democracy. They will insist that it be written in the coalition agreement that in the first 30 days the governments adopt immediate solutions to start normalization.
""At LMŠ, we firmly believe that development can be based solely on the knowledge society. We work in accordance with the principle that opportunity should be offered to all under equal conditions. Coexistence between an open, competitive economy and propulsive crafts and entrepreneurship on the one hand - also trade union - and quality public policies in the field of health, environment, education, social, security, culture and management of public affairs on the other hand, we are firmly convinced that the key to success of the individual and society as a whole, but the only right answer Our program is based on this awareness and value framework, which is based on the assumption that the challenges of modern society are very complex and require a comprehensive approach of various actors, ""said LMŠ.
According to Šarec, LMŠ wants to implement its program in the government, which will not deal with the issue of its existence every day, but will deal with people's problems.

What measures would you take to keep us from getting cold next winter and the shelves still stocked with food? Will young people be able to afford their own apartment? Today the situation is even worse than four years ago. What about foreign policy? Most parties, for example, are still in favor of NATO.","The analysis of pre-election programs was divided into two content sets. In the first we publish healthcare, economy, energy with environmental impacts, housing issues through the prism of youth, education, media, agriculture and defense.
We emphasize that if we did not find the answer in an individual election program, it does not necessarily mean that the party does not offer a solution elsewhere. We analyzed the programs of all parliamentary parties and the Freedom Movement party, which is placed at the forefront by various opinion polls. In the elections, the party Konkretno is running in the alliance of the Let's Connect Slovenia party, which according to the latest Mediana opinion poll enjoys 1.9 percent of support.
Healthcare
Supplementary insurance
The parties SD, LMŠ, SAB, Levica would abolish supplementary health insurance and place it under compulsory insurance. The LMŠ party is convinced that supplementary health insurance today is a market activity and instead of health care, part of the collected money is used for the profits of commercial insurance companies. The Gibanje Svoboda, DeSUS and Nova Slovenija parties would reform supplementary insurance, while Nova Slovenija would establish competition in the field of compulsory health insurance. The Svoboda Movement announces the transformation of supplementary insurance, when 600 million a year will be provided for public health funds within the framework of a broad social consensus. The SDS did not opt ​​for supplementary insurance in the program.
Concessions in health care would be abolished by the parties Nova Slovenija and Levica. The Left proposes that the concessionaires operate on a non-profit basis and return the surplus to the public health system.
'Amphibians in healthcare'
Against t. i. amphibians in health care, ie doctors who perform their work in public and private health care at the same time, would take action in the Left, the SAB, the Freedom Movement and the SD. The SD party would limit the work of doctors in the public and private sectors at the same time, afternoon work and other forms of supplementary work would be disabled in the Left. The SAB would clearly delineate the work of doctors in the public and private sectors. In Nova Slovenija, however, they advocate that medical staff who meet the standards would be allowed to work in the private sector, and that employees would also be rewarded for their work results.
Waiting times
The reduction of waiting times will be started immediately in the SD, the program predicts. Their goal is to reach a maximum of 30 days for a specialist examination. The SAB is also announcing a program to reduce waiting times. In the Freedom Movement, queues would be eliminated by a temporary measure - all doctors who are able to perform services can compete for performance. The SDS predicts that a competitive environment will lead to shorter waiting times due to more efficient work methods and cheaper services. They add that they will ensure timely access to a personal physician and specialist treatment. In Levica, they say that they will eliminate waiting periods with additional co-financing of programs that ZZZS pays after implementation. The LMŠ would allocate additional funds to shorten waiting times and establish legal possibilities for additional payment of employees. The SNS, like the others, is in favor of shorter queues and does not offer concrete solutions in the program.
ZZZS and other measures
In SD, the role of ZZZS would be strengthened and modernized, the renovation of ZZZS is also announced in Desus. The SAB party would increase the number of family doctors by improving working conditions and higher wages. Their priority is also the construction of a regional hospital in Ljubljana. The Desus party would introduce a legal obligation to involve all health resources in the country. In Levica, a public company would be established for the purchase of medical materials and medicines, thus limiting corruption and profiteering in this area. In the SNS party, priority would be given to health legislation, which would not include private individuals. They also support a central public procurement system without intermediaries. They are advocating for the legalization of cannabis.
The SD would gradually increase funding for public health. The DeSUS party would increase its share of GDP for healthcare to 9.3 percent. The Left Party would strengthen the public health system with additional funds, especially at the primary level of health care, accelerate the import of health personnel and increase the capacity of medical faculties. The client does not offer concrete solutions in the field of healthcare. In their program, they emphasize the importance of digitalization, which will put the patient at the center, and the reform of the Health Insurance Institute.
Economy
In the program, Konkretno, SAB, DeSUS, Levica and Gibanje Svoboda are advocating for a greener economy. NSi is advocating the withdrawal of the state from the economy, while the SNS should be bought out. Privatization procedures would be stopped in the Left. The tax relief of the economy was announced in the SDS, where, for example, small entrepreneurs would be allowed flat-rate taxation. The Slovenian state holding company would be transformed into the National Demographic Fund in the SDS and most of the state's investments would be transferred to it. They see untapped economic potential in wood. The same is true in LMŠ, where we would redefine the relations between the owners of forest plots and the state and encourage the sale of wood within various so-called ""wood exchanges"".
In Levica, the economy would be focused on the participation of workers in management and forms of workers' ownership of companies. Most concrete measures in the field of debureaucratization are offered by the LMŠ, which would reduce the number of regulations by 10 percent in the next four years.
Energy
The second block of NEK
The Ministry of Infrastructure, headed by Jernej Vrtovec, has issued an energy permit to Gen energija for the second unit of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant (JEK 2), but it does not have the support of all political parties in the construction. The SD party is convinced that the citizens should decide on the construction of the second block of the nuclear power plant in a referendum. The SAB, Desus, Gibanja Svoboda, Levica and LMŠ also agree with the consultative referendum. Support for the consultative referendum was also expressed in NSi. Their goal is for Slovenia to become a net exporter of electricity. This would be achieved through well-utilized renewable resources and the second block of the Krško nuclear power plant, which they support. In the Svoboda Movement, the second block of the nuclear power plant is conditioned by transparency and independence in managing investment decisions and respect for the decision in the referendum, as they say, only those nuclear technologies controlled by the Western world will be acceptable.
The Left would stop this project and hold a referendum first. The SNS supports NEK-2, and the SDS party is also announcing the construction of the second block.
TEŠ
Regarding the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant, which produces about a third of the electricity, only the Levica and Konkretno parties are specific. The Left advocates that the use of coal should be abandoned by 2030 and that the Šaleška region be restructured economically. The party specifically points to the reform of the energy sector. They advocate the closure of TEŠ in 2038.
Green energy and renewables
Let's look at customer commitments in the field of green energy, renewables and the concept of energy in the future. In Nova Slovenija, they are advocating a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. They would encourage solar power plants in degraded areas, and also support the construction of a chain of power plants on the lower and middle Sava. Solar incentives are also supported in SD, in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and introducing an energy cap to limit rising electricity prices.
The SAB party will complete the construction of a chain of hydroelectric power plants on the Lower Sava and begin construction on the Middle Sava. We would also set up a 3rd energy pillar for a faster transition to green renewable energy. Desus also supports investment programs for the construction of smaller solar power plants and the exploitation of the potentials of the Sava River and wind farms. They are in favor of banning technologies that threaten the quality of natural resources. The Freedom Movement would accelerate the solarization of surfaces and support the self-sufficiency of all forms. It would increase investment in the grid and enable the use of standing water, riparian and agricultural land for investment in renewable energy sources. We would reduce the role of natural gas, abolish the mandatory connection to the gas network for heating in individual new buildings and encourage heating devices to renewable energy sources.
The Left is encouraging a 60 percent reduction in greenhouse gases over the next two governments compared to 2005. It will provide a 2 percent of GDP financial framework to combat climate change, part of which will go to the decarbonisation fund and part to long-term adaptation. We would accept a commitment to decarbonise state-owned enterprises by 2030 and abolish subsidies for all fossil fuels by 2025 and reduce their use by 2035. We would launch a comprehensive program to build larger solar power plants and roof solarization, achieving 10% in five years solar energy in the takeover. The LMŠ party would invest in renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric power plants, solar cells and wind potential. We would increase the capacity of municipal waste incinerators, invest in companies that create sustainable jobs.
The SDS promises stability of electricity supply and a gradual transition to renewable sources, because Slovenia's energy concept should be based on new investments in competitive, sustainable, reliable and secure additional production sources. They promise lower electricity bills: we will streamline the operation of public services in this area, which means less pressure on the network and levies, which already account for more than half of the electricity bill, they predict.
Youth, family, education, media
Housing policy
Measures on how to get the first owner-occupied apartment are offered by NSi, SAB, LMŠ and Gibanje Svoboda. The Christian Democrats would establish a guarantee scheme for young families in this area, an image also in the SAB. The LMŠ would ensure that an individual could get their first apartment by paying rent, while the Svoboda Movement wrote that the state would guarantee the loan upon purchase. Housing issues in Levica would be tackled with the construction of 30,000 non-profit flats by 2030, and a public rental service would be opened in LMŠ. In the SD, municipalities would be empowered to set the highest possible rents.
DeSUS supports the construction of housing cooperatives, they will provide a greatly increased construction of rental housing for young families, the socially disadvantaged and the elderly.
Families
Families would be taxed in NSi. The basic income for children, young people under 20 and the unemployed would be introduced in the SDS. In public administration, 5,000 jobs would be allocated to young people in the SAB. In the field of education, free school meals for all are announced in the SD. The package of measures in the school system was prepared by the SNS. For example, we would introduce biology in the 6th grade, abolish descriptive grades in the first triad, and unify textbooks throughout Slovenia. A one-year course would be introduced for foreigners who would like to be part of the Slovenian school system. At all levels of education, they advocate for entrance exams. The SAB party would provide free public transport for young people, pupils and students, and teach pupils and students about democracy in primary and secondary schools. The SDS is advocating for the renewal of curricula, so that they would allow more freedom to teachers, which would strengthen their autonomy.
The media
The SDS would also renew the media legislation, specifically how, they did not write in the program. However, they did so in the Svoboda Movement and the LMŠ. Both parties are in favor of independent and free media and legislation that would reduce political influence on public service broadcasting and the STA.
Agriculture
Self-sufficiency
The SAB party would promote its own self-sufficiency, local sales and consumption. They will try to increase their own food production by more than 80 percent in vegetables, fruits and cereals. They believe that we need to ensure 100% self-sufficiency in meat and dairy products. DeSUS also believes that the share of self-sufficiency should be increased and dependence on imports reduced. They identified this as a strategic priority for agricultural development. There are no concrete measures in the LMŠ to increase self-sufficiency in the program, but they wrote that the use of local food in public institutions would be raised to at least 40 percent. A special plan of work with farms and young entrepreneurs, better conditions for the transfer of farms between generations, a more favorable tax environment for agriculture and complementary activities, appropriate social policy and rural infrastructure would be established.
The Left Party is encouraging an increase in the amount of organically produced food, with the aim of increasing organic agricultural land by up to 25% by 2030. Battery-based animal husbandry would be banned and free-range farming encouraged. Animal protection controls would be tightened. The use of carcinogenic soil herbicides would be abolished and the control of antibiotics in food, especially meat, would be improved. We would end up advertising meat and dairy products and promoting plant-based foods. They promote sustainable forest management.
The SD party would improve self-sufficiency with locally grown fruit, vegetables and meat, focusing on the maximum share of organic production and at the same time promoting own food production and cultivation of smaller arable land (gardeners) and offering locally grown food in restaurants and other catering establishments.
In particular, the party believes that in the future we should strengthen Slovenian agriculture and achieve greater weight of domestic agriculture in the food industry chain. Their goal is high self-sufficiency of Slovenia with locally produced food. In the SDS, self-sufficiency in locally produced food would be enabled through an active agricultural policy.
The situation of farmers
The Freedom Movement would promote sustainable agriculture and establish green supply chains between smallholder farmers and end customers. In public food procurement, we would strictly require the purchase of food from local Slovenian food producers. The NSi party would ensure an adequate income position for farmers (possibility of agricultural insurance for family members, higher support for farms with very difficult cultivation conditions) and an expanded range of ancillary activities on farms. They promise more funds for measures for young farmers, more funds for adapting farms to new farming conditions. Strengthening the processing and marketing of own products.
The party Specifically supports the project of smart villages and measures to make the younger generations more attractive in agriculture. The SDS sees wood as a great opportunity for Slovenia's economic development. They predict a tax relief for farmers. The Agricultural Land Fund would be abolished.
The SAB and the Left say they will transpose the principle of the right to drinking water into legislation.
Defense and security
Then, investments in the military and conscription
The parties are not unanimous about the funds that the state budget would allocate in the future for defense and about Slovenia's role in NATO. On the one hand, the NSi party would raise defense spending to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2024, predicting the construction of a middle battalion battle group by 2026 and the continued modernization of the military and the purchase of new equipment. The SD will strive to provide a stable source of funding that will enable further modernization of the army. It would improve the social security of soldiers and further encourage voluntary military service. The SDS announces the establishment of a dynamic system of compulsory military training, the strengthening of the Slovenian Armed Forces in personnel and weapons, and support for the development of a national cyber defense system.
The Svoboda Movement is in favor of modernizing the Slovenian Army. Slovenian high-tech companies would have an advantage when buying equipment. They have a different position in the Left, where they are proposing to repeal the law on 780 million for arms purchases and to withdraw from all already concluded contracts. They believe that we should limit the purchase of military equipment to the equipment that the army needs to provide socially useful tasks. We would launch a public debate on the possibility of demilitarizing Slovenia. The LMŠ would establish national civilian readiness in a way that would connect the defense ministry with other parts of the critical infrastructure.
In the Left, they are against the introduction of forced military service. Compulsory military service would be introduced in the SNS party. The SDS announces the establishment of a dynamic system of compulsory military training, the strengthening of the Slovenian Armed Forces in personnel and weapons, and support for the development of a national cyber defense system.
The Left is strongly in favor of Slovenia's withdrawal from NATO, proposing a referendum and neutrality. They will also advocate the withdrawal of EU member states from NATO. The army would be withdrawn from NATO military operations abroad, and participation in peacekeeping operations will have to be decided by parliament. The SNS is also in favor of Slovenia's withdrawal from NATO, and their defense policy should be based on armed neutrality outside military alliances. Opposite NATO membership is supported in Nova Slovenija. However, the SD believes that a referendum on NATO membership is not necessary.
Police
In Nova Slovenija, in the field of police, they want to strengthen the number of uniformed police work, they announce the introduction of t. i. foot patrols, modernization of police infrastructure and re-establishment of police district heads. They will also advocate the construction of a national civil protection center and three regional sub-centers. The SD party will advocate the immediate abolition of all measures of political subordination of the police. They are announcing the reorganization of the General Police Administration, the abolition of the complete subordination of the Criminal Police Administration and the Uniformed Police Administration under the GPU. The SAB is also advocating for the depoliticization of the police and the army. They also support the strengthening of cyber security and the prosecution of hate speech.
The parties Konkretno and Desus do not mention defense measures in their program.

According to him, the movement will try to connect the divided Slovenian sides and lead Slovenia into the future.","According to Zdravko Počivalšek, the only credible poll is the parliamentary elections, but he is convinced that the movement will achieve a double-digit result in the upcoming April parliamentary elections and be part of the future government. He stressed that after the election they will talk to all parties: ""In the new government, we will work with those who want to look forward, not left, right and back.""
As he explained, the movement in the April parliamentary elections is being eliminated with six key points.
In the first place, he pointed out the conditions for the economy, which will in turn enable a welfare state and a public sector that serves all citizens. They will advocate for a green and digital transition. “It’s the end of an era when we imported cheap energy and exported garbage,” he reminded.
According to him, debureaucratization and balanced and harmonious development of all regions in Slovenia are also important. “Everywhere we want to create the conditions for young people to get a job, a solid salary and create living conditions,” he said. They also want new demographic policies that will contribute to the ""growth of the number of Slovenes"".
In his address, the head of the movement's election headquarters and president of the SLS, Marjan Podobnik, recalled today's World Cup in ski jumping in Planica. ""These days, Slovenian flags are flying in Planica. Then we put the flags in place and pull a whole series of mutual accusations out of our arsenal,"" he said.

'Enable voting for all citizens',"On March 8, the Institute responded to a decision by the National Electoral Commission (DVK) that voters in isolation due to a new coronavirus infection will be able to vote at home, but will have to submit an application by April 20th. The DVK called for voting to be available to all citizens, including those whose coronavirus infection will be confirmed after 20 April.","At Thursday's session, the National Electoral Commission decided that in addition to voting by mail, voters who will be in isolation due to coronavirus infection on the day of the National Assembly elections will also have the option of voting at home. In this case, they will have to submit the application for voting at home to the district election commission no later than April 24 by midnight.
At the Institute on March 8, they expressed concern that some voters would not be able to cast their vote. The question arises as to what this means for all those who will be confirmed infected after 20 April. ""As we understand it, these voters will not actually be able to cast their vote,"" Kristina Krajnc of the institute told a news conference.
They also pointed out the practice from abroad and pointed out that several European countries still enabled voters to participate in the elections in the event of a covid-19 infection.
At the press conference, they also pointed out that on Thursday, registration for voting from abroad was prevented half an hour before the deadline, which they described as violations of the right to vote.
The DVK announced that they were aware of the error that occurred in the last hour before the deadline for submitting the application. They explained that there was a system failure due to incorrect setting of the time window in the computer program. They apologized to the voters for their mistake and assured them that their applications, which arrived last night between 11 pm and midnight, would be considered timely."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/dvk.html,DVK explains why it was not possible to submit an application for voting from abroad for a short time,"On Thursday, several citizens informed the Office of the National Electoral Commission (DVK) that the last hour before the deadline for submitting an application for voting by post from abroad could not be submitted. ""We immediately checked the matter with the administrator of online services operates under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Administration, and received information that there was a system failure due to incorrect setting of the time window in the computer program, ""now explain to DVK and add:"" We sincerely apologize to voters and assure that their roles, which arrived last night between 11 pm and midnight, considered timely. ""","According to the technical administrators of the online services, the problems were caused by the period calculated when blocking the application for the elections 30 days before the election date, the DVK further announced. In the time period of 30 days before the election, the clock is shifted from winter to summer time and thus the resulting loss of 60 minutes, and the program code calculates the exact time 30 days before the election. ""This is an extraordinary situation that happened due to the period before the change of clock,"" they say on DVK. Such problems have not been detected since 2016, nor was it foreseen in the design of the solution scenario.
The method of calculating the blockade for the possibility of submitting applications will, as promised, be programmed in the future so that the calculation of the period will not be performed on the calculation of time between two time points, but in such a way as to control only the specific date. possible.
Explanation from the administrators of the web services of the eGovernment portal:
The date of the elections is set for April 25, 2022, which is written in the program format as 24.04.2022 00:00:00 GMT + 0200 (Central European Summer Time). The day on which the problem occurred on the part of the user was March 24, 2022 at 23:00:01, which is written in the program format as 24.03.2022 23:00:01 GMT + 0100 (Central European Standard Time) . The program code is set so that the time period of the difference between the days is calculated in milliseconds. Due to the shift of the clock, which will occur on March 27, 2022, there was an error in the calculation of the blockade of the application. The program code calculated that there were only 30 days left between 24 March 2022 2022 23:00:01 and 24 April 2022 00:00:00 h, so the possibility of submitting the application was consequently locked. If there had been no movement of the clock in the intervening period of up to 30 days before the election, there would have been no loss of 60 minutes and thus no error would have occurred.
At the press conference, they also pointed out that on Thursday, registration for voting from abroad was prevented half an hour before the deadline, which they described as violations of the right to vote."

The self-praise of political parties for submitting candidacies a month before the elections flew one after another this week. But the key will be who the voters will trust. And not only in terms of programs that can only be a letter on paper, but also in terms of achievements to date and responsible management of taxpayers' money, which no government so far can boast of below the line. But as we face key challenges, even after the epidemic and the war in Ukraine, these elections will be particularly important. Not only who will win, it will be important who will form the government.","According to opinion polls, the SDS parties of Janez Janša and the Svoboda Movement of Robert Golob are the highest. And who with them if one or the other wins? Not only who will win, it will be important who will form the government. Aljaž Pengov Bitenc and Rok Čakš discussed this in the show 24UR ZVEČER.
Can the war in Ukraine benefit the SDS?
The war in Ukraine has shuffled pre-election cards and could benefit the SDS, Caks is convinced. ""As far as the tragic story with Ukraine is concerned, it is written on the skin of politicians like Janez Janša, because he is one of the few, if not the only European leaders with war experience in high positions,"" he said. In his opinion, Janša thinks proactively because of this experience and behaves in the same way in the international arena.
Peng Bitenc is more critical of the moves made by the government during the war in Ukraine. ""What Mr. Jansa is doing with his quasi-initiatives to resolve the war in Ukraine is just a signal that he is supposed to fabricate a state of his own, but I think that all in all it means a little struggle in practice. a pose for domestic needs, ”he said. At the same time, he estimates that the voters that Janša would potentially gain from this will primarily leave the NSi pool.
While Peng's Bitenc emphasizes that Janša's moves are not coordinated at the European level, that they do not have a broader mandate and even cause quite a few worries, Čakš believes that the dust is rising mainly at home. ""If we look at foreign media, these moves that Janša is making on the international stage are welcomed positively as an expression of courage and support for Ukraine,"" he said.
""However, the opposition has found itself in a precarious position because the context of the election campaign with the war in Ukraine and its aftermath has changed drastically. They thought we would talk about government mistakes during the corona crisis And in these things the government is very proactive, the whole coalition is very proactive and this proactivity undoubtedly benefits it, ""Čakš is convinced.
The only one who understood the moment and knew how to respond properly to Janša's initiative to visit Kiev was Robert Golob, who praised him and thus gained the legitimacy to criticize Janša when necessary. While KUL criticizes practically everything, what this government is doing, and is therefore illegitimate in this criticism, ""he added. Pengov Bitenc: ""I think that Mr. Janša is the last person who can deny someone legitimacy, and consequently the claims of Mr. Čakš do not drink water here."" According to him, by praising Janša, Golob removed the topic from the table and can continue to build his campaign. ""Janša's actions in Ukraine are basically Slovenia's domestic political story,"" he is convinced.
We cannot pretend that there is no war in Ukraine and that it does not have its effects on the international environment and also on Slovenia, replied Čakš, who insists that the crisis is a water mill for the government. ""This crisis has brought substantive issues to the forefront and put the government in a proactive position, which is their current electoral advantage. solution, ""he said.
Rather than winning, it is a question of who will form the coalition
Peng's Bitenc believes a lot depends on the dynamics on the left. ""If it happens that Robert Golob gets a majority as an individual party, but that KUL as a coalition gets a similar or even slightly smaller result, it can happen that we will watch the formation of the government for a long time, because the left tends to big egos in small space. However, if it happens that Prime Minister Janša would in some way challenge the result of the elections, then we can have a very tense beginning of the summer, ""he predicts.
For Čakš, however, it is crucial how many allies of each side will be included in the National Assembly, as the result of the election will not be decided by the direct winner. On the right, Janša cannot count on the composition of the government without NSi and Connect Slovenia, but on the other hand, the question is how many KUL parties will be included in parliament and with what result. The question is also the Left, or whether deputies with more extreme views will be willing to accept compromises, he explained. ""There are a lot of unknowns here, everything is open, and decisions will be made at the lower limit of entering parliament.""
Attendance is also important, the higher it is, the harder it is for smaller parties to reach the parliamentary threshold, he added. ""In this regard, it will be very important what the turnout will be, because we have so many parties on the border of four percent."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kampanja-volitve2022.html,"The beginning of the election campaign: NSi by bus around Slovenia, SD candidates like live posters","We will certainly be able to spot candidates for elections and political party programs everywhere next month. Some of them have already started field activities, all with the same goal - to convince voters why they are the ones who deserve your vote. The party NSi and SD started the fastest, leaving the people on the first day of the election campaign.","From the bus, members and candidates of the NSi party will greet and convince you all over Slovenia. They followed the ideas of Lojze Peterle from 2004, who was the first to go to the polls by bus and then won a decisive victory with the party. ""In the election campaign itself, we find it most valuable to have that genuine contact with voters to tell us the things they strive for and in this way help us improve as a party,"" explains NSi party president Matej Tonin.
They will also try to attract attention along the road in the SD, which walked like live posters during major traffic jams along major traffic lanes. ""We are announcing that we have capable people, young, old, new, that we know what we want to do, that we have a plan and that we are very confident in the campaign,"" said Tanja Fajon, leader of the SD parliamentary group.
The roadside billboards of the SDS party are the target of vandals
Most parties, however, still swear by roadside billboards to address voters. Even before the election campaign, we were able to see advertising posters at several locations, especially the SDS parties, which were already the target of vandals. ""The question is what impact these ads have on voters, some research shows that they are not very big, but this does not prevent or convince parties not to invest their resources in it,"" explains political scientist Marinko Banjac.
However, the funds will not be invested only in promotion, the SAB party has decided, where part of the money from the campaign will be used to collect humanitarian aid for Ukraine, because, as they say, they will not sit idly by. ""In the next few days, we will start collecting this aid, and we will publish the specific items we will collect and the locations on our website,"" Alenka Bratušek describes the activities of the SAB party.
For voters, however, it is important, above all, to ask ourselves what the parties are planning in their programs."

They will have to submit an application to the district election commission by April 20 at the latest, along with an appropriate certificate of isolation.","Among other things, DVK members also adopted instructions to district election commissions and election committees to prevent the spread of new coronavirus infections. Respect for mutual distance will have to be ensured at polling stations, the use of protective masks, hand disinfection and ventilation will be mandatory. Voters will enter individually, and pens will be disinfected. Floor markings of the direction of movement and markings for maintaining the appropriate distance will be installed at the polling stations.
After examining the security situation and logistical conditions of doing business in Russia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs assessed that the conditions for holding elections at the Slovenian Embassy in Moscow were not set. The DVK discussed today what to do with the polling station there. Election materials cannot be delivered there due to disabled postal services. In the event that the situation does not change soon, the DVK will make the final decision at a correspondence session.
The DVK also decided on the applications for accreditation for election observation so far and approved the application to 14 representatives of the international non-governmental organization World Peace Volunteers based in Ghana. However, due to non-compliance with the conditions set out in the Rules on Criteria, Conditions and Procedure for Obtaining Election Observation Accreditation, the DVK rejected the role of Rob Thompson from the United Kingdom.
According to the rules, observers can be representatives of domestic and foreign organizations, institutions, associations and societies and international organizations involved in the field of elections, protection of human rights, integrity or education, and members or. representatives of the central electoral authorities of other countries, but not individuals."

The party believes that Slovenia needs their green thinking, and urges voters to cast their vote with the future in mind.","According to Zgojznik, their candidates are very diverse, from workers, students to researchers and doctors, 40 percent of whom are women. The youngest is 18 years old and the oldest 81 years old.
Among them are two Slovenes of the Year, Petra Greiner and party president Urša Zgojznik, Goldman recipient Uroš Macerl, Orlek singer Vlado Poredoš, mountain rescuer Klemen Belhar, women's rights activist Jasmina Jerant, Slovene Greens leader Miha Jazbinšek and honorary citizen of Novo Mesto Janez Penca.
Zgojznikova pointed out that she submitted her candidacy with her daughter in mind, as the question of what kind of world she will live in in 10 or 20 years is also a question for this year's parliamentary elections. The fact that we are still talking about manipulation, hatred, division of society is definitely not a topic that would interest my daughter. Green topics are missing, we are not talking about what kind of water we will drink, what kind of food we will eat. The Ukrainian crisis shows us how dependent we are on others, how poor our self-sufficiency is, ”she said. Rights are also an important topic for the party.
The party wants to cross the parliamentary threshold, and even if opinion polls predict 0.5 to 3.5 percent support, they are not pessimistic and do not intend to give up. They believe that public opinion results are being manipulated and that there are certain agendas. They are convinced that they have more support in Slovenia and that April 24 will show the right result.
If they cross the parliamentary threshold, they will talk to all parties because they think these are too important topics. According to the party president, it would be difficult to sit at the same table with the current ruling coalition ""because of the curtailment of rights or the restriction of democratic principles"", but they do not want to be exclusive at the moment.
On Saturday, the candidates will present themselves in person at the constituencies, with cleaning and other actions. The parties think it is more important to contribute to society than to rent large halls ""for painting and patting"", said Zgoznikova, who also announced the party's participation in Friday's climate protest."

There will be 38 male and 30 female candidates running in the election, some of whom will run in two constituencies, so the party will have its own candidates in all 88 constituencies.
The youngest member of the party is Neja Gajzer from Maribor, born in 1996, the oldest is Janez Artač, born in 1941.
Although some have already written off DeSUS, the party leadership expects the party to run for parliament. ""The party leadership is very happy that we had no problems in selecting candidates for the parliamentary elections and collecting signatures. Participation in our election conferences was 100%. The moral conscience of pensioners will continue to be present in Slovenia. We expect that we will come to the parliament and decide on an equal footing with other parties on the lives of 600,000 Slovenes who are retired today, ""he emphasized.
Among DeSUS's program priorities, Jasnič highlighted care for health, social services, pensions and long-term care, with special emphasis on cooperation with civil society. ""Our motto is that no one in Slovenia should be hungry, no one should be cold. This country is so rich that it must take care of all its elderly people,"" Jasnič emphasized.
When asked how they assess the moves of some DeSUS deputies who are running for other parties, such as MP Branko Simonovič, Jasnič emphasized that they do not think anything good of these members in the party.
We do not support that our leading people, those who played a prominent role in DeSUS and had good positions and services at the expense of the party, suddenly find that they no longer belong to DeSUS. In our opinion, such actions harm the party, ""stressed Jasnič. He also believes that ""other parties in DeSUS see the prey they can take before the elections"", but in his words, their care for pensioners is only temporary."

""The great support of the people fills us with hope and confidence that we will be able to make this project possible,"" said the president of the Freedom Movement.
Golob believes that the reconstruction of the country will be necessary due to external circumstances that are not in our favor. ""We are going from a health crisis to an energy crisis, to a Ukrainian crisis, etc. We also have a crisis of democracy in Slovenia,"" he said. The Svoboda Movement is convinced that now is the last chance to turn all this in Slovenia's favor. Golob believes that by activating citizens and their dormant capital in banks, they will ""create new value"" and thus fill the state coffers, ""he added.
Regarding his candidacy in the Ljubljana units, Golob emphasized that analysts played a decisive role in this, as they want to achieve the best possible result. According to Golob, Nova Gorica already has a strong candidate, former mayor Matej Arčon. ""We have one goal and that is victory, and we also subordinate who is running where,"" Golob said. The coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, is also running in the same districts of Ljubljana as Golob. Asked who will win this fight, Golob replied: ""Do you think I doubt myself? I have never doubted myself, the Freedom Movement will certainly celebrate.""

Anthropologist Svetlana Slapšak will also run on the list of the Left, who agrees that this election will be historic.

Our ideas, which we wrote down in the election program, are crucial for the future of the country,"" they wrote in today's press release. They reiterated that the party's goals are to break into parliament and government.
The Pirate Party was founded in 2012, but has so far failed to cross the parliamentary threshold. Earlier this month, the party also gained new leadership. At the electronic congress, Boštjan Tavčar, a long-time vice-president and founding member of the party, was elected the new president.
The non-partisan list of the Healthy Society movement is also in the election race
Candidate lists for the April National Assembly elections were also submitted to the People's List of the Healthy Society Movement in all eight constituencies. According to the movement, this is the first non-partisan list of voters in the history of Slovenia.
According to them, over 1,000 legally required signatures of voters in support of the non-partisan People's List were collected in each constituency. There are a total of 77 candidates on the lists drawn up by voters in each constituency, of which 33 are women and 44 are men.
The non-partisan list consists of ""all of us who have enough political parties, stupid measures, harmful laws and unreasonable spending of our budget. Who want a truly healthy society as a pillar of development,"" the movement's website said.
The Resni.ca party submitted candidate lists for the National Assembly elections
The president of the non-parliamentary party Resni.ca, Zoran Stevanović, submitted the party's candidate lists for the parliamentary elections in eight constituencies. 85 of their candidates will run in all 88 constituencies, and the lists have been backed by nearly 1,200 people, the party said."

Candidate lists in all eight constituencies in Slovenia were also submitted to the SD. Maurizio Tremul will run for deputy of Italian nationality, the Unitarieta - Insieme (Unity - Together) group announced.","The president of the SAB party, Alenka Bratušek, expressed her belief that the current government will no longer exist after the elections and that Slovenia will need brave, reliable people with experience who have already proved themselves in the crisis in the next term. She emphasized that the SAB team had already fought to fulfill its pre-election promises during this term and that they had already proved themselves in the party during the 2013 financial crisis.
Bratušek called on the citizens to take part in the upcoming elections in as large a number as possible, so that Slovenia would get ""a strong center-left government that it deserves"". She emphasized the importance of maintaining a stable and stable economy, the welfare state and raising pensions.
Bratušek also expressed her belief that the parties of the KUL coalition, with which the SAB has signed an agreement for cooperation after the elections, will get the most votes in the elections. At the same time, she assured that they will also cooperate well with the Freedom Movement, as the parties have a lot in common in terms of content.
The SAB is running in the elections with a list of 80 candidates. On the party's list of candidates, which will also include 38 candidates, all current deputies will also run. Bratuškova in the Kranj constituency, Marko Bandelli in the Postojna unit, Maša Kociper in the Ljubljana center unit, Andrej Rajh and Branislav Rajić in the Maribor unit and Vojko Starović in the Celje unit.
Candidate lists were submitted to the SD in all constituencies
Candidate lists were also submitted to the SD in all eight constituencies in Slovenia today. The president of the party, Tanja Fajon, said that they have an excellent plan, a capable team, a desire for change and the energy to work differently. 86 candidates are running in the elections, most of them women and young people in the party's history.
In response to a question about the post-election alliance with the SDS, Fajonova rejected the possibility of cooperating with this party, which ""has done a lot of damage in this country"". According to her, the SD does not cooperate with parties that violate the constitution and legislation, conduct disrespectful dialogue, discredit people and limit critical thinking and civil society. Fajon sees no opportunity to engage with parties that are not close to their values ​​and the values ​​of tolerance, respect and dialogue.
He sees a natural ally in the Freedom Movement. She said they share ""the same values ​​and the same desire to change the government, make a fresh start and return people to normalcy"". On the connection of the Freedom Movement with KUL's clients, Fajonova said that they would definitely talk if they received any offer.
The SD president does not talk to anyone about staffing after the elections. “First we need to gain the trust of the voters, the result, and then we will decide who is the one who will have enough confidence to be able to form and form the next government,” she said.
Maurizio Tremul will run for Italian parliament
The candidate of the Unitarieta - Insieme (Unity - Together) group for the seat of the Italian national community is the long-time president of the Union of Italians, Maurizio Tremul. He emphasized the need for dialogue, unity and transparency within the national community. The current MP Felica Žiža also intends to run.
The upcoming parliamentary mandate will be demanding and will require certain skills, such as dialogue, the ability to listen to other opinions and political experience, said Tremul, who is from Koper, at today's presentation of his candidacy in Izola.
He emphasized the need to involve all minority individuals and institutions. ""Our voice wants to be the voice of all, the voice of the unity of the Italian national community, the voice of dialogue, the voice of transparency,"" he added.
As Tremul emphasized, it is important for an MP to maintain a dialogue with all political parties and also with the government, but he must not be tied to just one party and must preserve the freedom to vote according to his conscience. He added that in case of election, he will be open to any post-election cooperation, taking into account certain principles, such as democracy and the rule of law.
Tremul emphasized the importance of transparent action for the benefit of the national community with wide participation within the minority, and added that as a member of the nationality he would also represent the interests of the Istrian region.
The representative of the Unitarieta - Insieme group, Ondina Gregorich Diabate, a municipal councilor from Koper, emphasized at today's presentation that not enough has been done so far for the development of the national community. According to her, she needs more dialogue and transparency, as well as more ambition and unity. The tremors were also supported by Luka Juri, director of the outgoing Koper Provincial Museum, and Bruno Orlando, who ran for parliament four years ago.
The current member of the national community, Felice Žiža, confirmed today that he will run again for a minority deputy. He will submit his candidacy in the coming days, and he is expected to present it to the media on Thursday."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/lms-pred-volitvami-v-potrjevanje-predsednika-in-predstavitev-kandidatov.html,"Šarc's new mandate at the head of LMŠ: 'We don't want to see Ljubljana, fumigated with tears,'","With 139 votes in favor and one against, LMŠ delegates gave Marjan Šarc a new mandate at the helm of the party a month before the parliamentary elections at the electoral congress in Maribor. Jerca Korča, a member of parliament, will also remain vice-president, while Igor Žavbi will be replaced in the second vice-presidential position by Klemen Grošelj, MEP.","Marjan Šarec did not have an opponent, and the LMŠ also coordinated the candidacies for other seats in the party in advance. In addition to the vice-presidents, a new executive committee was elected, in which the current vice-president Igor Žavbi, former interior minister Boštjan Poklukar and the president of the party's local committee in Dravograd Marjeta Podgoršek Rek were elected. The participants also elected members of the honorary tribunal at the congress.
In his address after the election, the new and current president of the party, who is running for the second time in the National Assembly, thanked the party members for their trust and added that he was aware of the responsibility and burden that awaits him. He recalled that four years ago, as a non-parliamentary party, they won 13 seats and became the second strongest parliamentary party, and then put a lot of effort into forming a government that disbanded after half its term.
""My move, which followed two years ago, was radical, but at the same time democratic. For the autocrats, it is a corn rifle, but for me it is a desire for new elections. Anyone who says that I have handed over power to the current government is very narrow-minded and he knows very little about the political backstage. They would accuse me of ruling at any cost according to Jelinčič's price list, ""Šarec said once again, rejecting accusations by his opponents that they feared an epidemic.
According to him, they are going to the elections with confidence, with the aim of achieving the best possible result, so that the current opposition will have enough votes to form a new government. According to him, the new government will need high support in order to be able to deal quickly and effectively with all the accumulated problems, and there will not be much time for negotiations.
According to Šarec, LMŠ wants to implement its program in the government, which will not deal with the issue of its existence every day, but will deal with people's problems. The regulation of affordable and quality health care, energy prices, high indebtedness, falling economic growth, and the green breakthrough are just a few of the issues he will be employed on.
According to him, the first task will be normalization and return to democracy. ""We don't want to see Ljubljana tear gas with tears. We are fed up with fences every week, we are fed up with settling accounts with the media and peaceful readers of the constitution. We will not solve this with tarnishing, defeatism and despair. ""Let's go to the polls and give our voice to democracy,"" he said.
As he believes that the next government will be a coalition in any case, adjustments of all partners will be needed. He also mentioned the newly formed party, which is also presenting its candidate list today, which Šarec symbolically sees as a good sign for future cooperation. “I’m happy for anyone who gathers the courage to go into politics,” he said.
Šarec sees immediate confrontation with the consequences of the epidemic as a precondition for starting a successful term. According to him, additional financial resources should be allocated to public health immediately to carry out emergency examinations, treatments and operations that were not carried out due to the epidemic.
As the management of the intimidation epidemic has not had a good effect on the people, they will insist that it be written into the coalition agreement that the governments take immediate solutions to begin normalization within the first 30 days. The umbrella law, which is also supported by non-governmental organizations, would immediately eliminate some of the ""undercuts"" of the current government, limit the independence of prosecutors, restrict non-governmental organizations in nature protection and the like.
They will also insist on the revision of the STA and RTV Slovenia laws in order to restore the professionalism and independence of both institutions. and rehabilitate all political personnel changes of people without basic competencies and experience in public administration as well as all other organizations that are directly or indirectly under the influence of the state.
The leader of the parliamentary group, the vice-president and the president of the youth group also spoke at the congress
The leader of the parliamentary group, Brane Golubović, emphasized at the congress that after the epidemic and numerous price increases, we are still facing the war in Europe, which has given impetus and fear additional impetus. According to him, the challenges are really great, but the key to the solution is people's trust in government and politics. ""The current government has not enjoyed this trust for some time. Especially not because it takes power as its property, state institutions and state-owned companies as its feuds, people as a passive crowd that must be silent, follow it, and use public media as propaganda machine, as a brass of her truth, ""he said.
According to the party's vice-president Jerca Korča, political developments in the last term have strengthened them even more in the awareness that every program commitment is a dead letter on paper if it is not backed by upright and hard-working people. ""For the next 35 days, we have a responsibility to invite people to make an important decision about the future of our society. Decide whether, as a society, we will allow the prisoners of the past to dismantle our community or go the normalization path and face challenges future, ""she added.
Žavbi also emphasized that the biggest challenge at the moment is the parliamentary elections, so the LMŠ made an effort and prepared a good list of candidates, which will be mostly represented by candidates who come from the local environment and those who know what and how to change in our country.
Nik Prebil, the president of the party's youth wing, also addressed the gathering, saying that young people were justifiably disappointed with most of the current policy, which did not take away their activity, interest, good ideas and desire for real change. ""We need to show decision-makers at all levels that youth is about politics, because the path to the realization of our programmatic starting points leads only through a policy that will not only listen to young people, but also hear and cooperate with them,"" he said.
The participants of the congress were greeted with video addresses by representatives of the European political group Alda and the presidents of all three other parties of the KUL alliance. SAB President Alenka Bratušek described LMŠ as natural allies, while SD President Tanja Fajon pointed out that Slovenia is facing groundbreaking elections to decide whether we will continue to be a democratic state or an autocracy. The champion of the Left, Luka Mesec, spoke about the good cooperation between the parties, especially since they have been in opposition."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/4000-javnih-najemnih-stanovanj-za-420-milijonov.html,4000 public rental housing for 412 million euros?,"Left Party coordinator Luka Mesec said while collecting signatures for a referendum on investments in the Slovenian Army: ""Instead of armored vehicles, which are only useful for missions abroad, we could build as many as 4,000 public rental apartments for 412 million euros."" Is this a realistic estimate?","According to the estimates of the coordinator of the Left party, Luka Mesca, 4,000 public rental apartments could be built in Slovenia with 412 million euros. We checked to see if that was true.
The Housing Fund of the Republic of Slovenia was asked to estimate the average investment value of the construction of 1,000 rental apartments. Costs, as they pointed out, can vary depending on the location, they also depend on the specifics of each location, urban location and other external factors.
Nevertheless, according to the fund's estimates, the cost of building 1,000 rental apartments is around 160 million euros, including tax. The investment value takes into account, inter alia, the costs of land, utilities and transport arrangements, preliminary investigations, design, equipment and financing costs, as required by applicable law.
One of the Housing Fund's latest projects - the brand new Novo Brdo neighborhood in Ljubljana, which offers 473 new rental apartments - cost € 78.67 million in taxes. According to this metrology, about 165 million euros should be allocated for 1,000 apartments.
Based on the data provided to us by the fund, we would need significantly more funds for the construction of 4,000 rental apartments, on average around 640 million euros. For 412 million, 2575 apartments could be built. The statement of the coordinator of the Left is therefore not true.
What are the needs for public rental housing?
Between 2020 and 2021, the Housing Fund of the Republic of Slovenia conducted a survey on the needs of public rental housing, to which 140 municipalities or their public funds responded. Based on the results, 9,668 public rental apartments would already be needed, depending on the needs.
The fact that there is a lot of interest in public rental housing is also shown by the number of applications for renting an apartment in the completely new Ljubljana neighborhood of Novo Brdo. Monthly rents there range from 322 euros for a one-bedroom to 972 euros for a four-bedroom apartment, and as many as 1,228 interested applicants have submitted their applications by the deadline.
For a square meter of second-hand apartment an average of 3250 euros
The supply of housing, especially in the capital, is limited, and prices are skyrocketing. In its semi-annual report for 2021, the Surveying and Mapping Authority states that Ljubljana maintains the primacy of the highest housing prices in Slovenia. After the median price of second-hand housing (median) in the second half of 2020 for the first time in history exceeded 3,000 euros per square meter, in the first half of 2021 it was already well above this limit (3250).
The highest relative price - over 7,200 euros per square meter - was achieved by an apartment in a new villa block in Vič. This apartment was absolutely the most expensive, as the buyer paid 850,000 euros for it together with the parking space. The relatively most expensive second-hand apartment was sold behind Bežigrad, for 570,000 euros.
The Housing Fund wants the future government to pay more attention to the construction of public rental housing and to provide sufficient and permanent financial and human resources. The competent ministries should start preparing the National Housing Program for the period 2026/2035, as consensus in this area is difficult to reach based on past experience, they warn. ""The program in question should also include certain commitments by the state on the side of providing financial resources to achieve the objectives to be set, clear criteria, measures, instruments and indicators, and an appropriate implementation framework.""
As part of the fund's own investments, approximately 1,120 flats are being built or being prepared for construction from 2022 to 2025/2026 at locations throughout Slovenia. After 2025, they plan to build around 1,170 housing units. With the amendments to the Housing Act adopted last year, the Ministry of the Environment estimated that by 2025 - also with the help of the public rental service - approximately 2,000 new rental apartments could be acquired."

Republican semi-trucks around the Bidn Campaign Bus on the Texas Highway, roadblocks and bridges blocked by rural Republicans, New Yorkers distrust police officers because their unions sided with the president. Anyone who is old enough to remember the end of Yugoslavia has unpleasant memories.","The confrontation between the Bidn campaign bus and the burning phalanx of Trumpists took place in central Texas on the San Antonio-Austin highway. A group of semi-trucks hung with Trump flags surrounded the bus and began to stop it at an ever-slower pace, prompting quite excited campaign members to call police. There was also a side-on collision between one of the semi-trucks and the campaign’s accompanying personal vehicle while driving. Yesterday, the FBI announced that it had launched an official investigation into the incident, and the president was not calming the situation, but was encouraging the already overheated atmosphere. At his rallies, he kept mentioning the Democrat bus hunt and arguing that it was proof of the flight and enthusiasm of his supporters. “You saw ours who, you know ... guarded that bus ... because they’re kind,” he twisted the story and was particularly impressed with the iconography of the flags with his name on it. Biden did not share his enthusiasm. “We’ve never faced anything like this before, we’ve never had a president think that’s a good sign,” he warned at a rally in Philadelphia yesterday.
Dozens of New Jersey rural residents occupied part of the Garden State Highway, which runs from the south of this state to New York, and stopped traffic for a while. With a similar mix of American and anti-Trump flags and trumpeting and shouting, they supported the re-election of the president. Another group tackled a renovated bridge leading to New York and closed one of the lanes to traffic for a while. It was a symbolic gesture, as the bridge is named after former New York Governor Mario Cuom, the father of current Governor Andrew Cuom, who often criticizes the president. A few of them, with decorated semi-trucks, even made their way to the edge of town, where they drove crosswise through the streets for some time. Three decades ago, more than 7,000 kilometers to the east, similar marches by people from rural areas to cities with similar political views, summed up in the slogan ""first we"", marked the beginning of the yogurt revolution, which erupted into a big rally in Kosovo Polje. Two years later, Yugoslavia was burned at the stake by interethnic and interfaith conflicts.
The United States may not have a net of inter-ethnic disputes, but it does have roughly outgrown scars from the Civil War and the decades of cultural war with which the parties exchanged voters. Increasingly conservative Republicans have taken on the role of racist Democrats in the South, and increasingly progressive Democrats have taken on the role of a black minority. Part of the Republican leadership tried to divert the party from sliding to the far right after the 2012 election defeat with a campaign autopsy, but then Trump happened, so today Republicans are more of a political cult than a political party. The other half reacted with antagonism to the controversial president, who sometimes borders on exorcism. When Trump’s bravest supporters marched in downtown Times Square over the weekend, not-so-friendly confrontations with mostly very liberal citizens quickly ensued, and then counter-protests erupted. The protesters were sent by the police and some of the most hardened closed, which is a new crack in trust in the guardians. He was strongly influenced by the sometimes too harsh intervention during the spring protests against racial violence, but it did not help that the union of police officers from a strongly democratic city strongly supported Trump.
Trump's judges
For months, the president has been deliberately fueling the political rift in the United States and blaming Democratic mayors and governors for every problem, from the outbreak of a pandemic to the outbreak of racial equality protests. He described Bidn's eventual election as ""the beginning of the destruction of America"". At the same time, he constantly claims that he will lose the election only because of possible major fraud. He urges his supporters to go to the polls tomorrow as observers, raising fears that we will witness similar riots as the incursion of armed Trump supporters into Michigan's parliament, especially as the president said in a confrontation with Biden's far-right militias ready. He was not bothered that in Michigan, federal police recently revealed alleged preparations by right-wing extremists to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. At the same time, the court there rejected efforts to ban the open carrying of weapons at polling stations.
According to the online newspaper Axios, Trump plans to declare victory on Tuesday night if the initial counting of ballots favors him, without waiting for the results of early voting and postal voting. Trump denied this yesterday, but then immediately added that ""it's awful if we can't find out the result of the vote on election night. As soon as it's over, we'll act with our lawyers."" Lawyers are already working: in Harris County, which is considered a strong democracy, they are trying to annul 127,000 ballots because voters were able to cast them right out of their cars to limit people-to-people contact during a pandemic. The Texas Supreme Court yesterday dismissed the lawsuit by Republican activists, but they also filed it in federal court, and strongly conservative Judge Andrew Hanen is expected to rule on it today, less than two days before the election ends.
This is only part of a legal battle between the two parties in which Democrats are trying to make it easier for voters to vote early and by mail, and the White House insists it poses a threat of electoral fraud, despite left-wing and right-wing election experts. that fraud is extremely rare, that there is no evidence for the president's claims, and that a fragmented electoral system almost prevents such large-scale conspiracies. Democrats are highly skeptical of the Supreme Court, which the president has infiltrated with three conservative judges, especially since Trump has always expressed an expectation that they will support him. Tensions escalate his evasion of calls to agree to a peaceful surrender of power if he loses. But it's not just top judges - with the Republican Senate virtually freezing the appointment of new federal judges under President Barack Obama and then expressly appointing dozens of heavily conservative judges in recent years, Trump has left a strong mark on US justice.
Postal delay
An analysis by a Washington Post officer shows that judges appointed under Trump mostly (in about 75 percent of cases) ruled in favor of Republican lawsuits and, despite the pandemic, did not allow voters easier access to the ballot. This is even more evident at the second, appellate stage, in which as many as 21 of the 25 court opinions were against easier access of voters to postal voting. At the same time, predictions are coming true that the U.S. Post Office will not be able to deliver the increased amount of ballots cast. In the summer, postmen across the U.S. began warning that the new leadership, set up by Trump's White House in June, was introducing changes that would make it harder to deliver shipments in an election year. New first postman Louis DeJoy promised at a congressional hearing that this was not the case and that the work would be done properly.
But in recent days, there have been growing backlogs, especially in those states where the presidential race is being decided. In Colorado and Wyoming, barely 43 percent of ballots were cast on time on Saturday, and in central Pennsylvania, arguably a key state election, only about 63 percent. Less than 90 percent of the ballots went on the road in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Carolina, other parts of Pennsylvania, and in some places in Florida and Texas. Democrats usually vote early (according to current analyzes, this year's ratio is three Democrats to one Republican), and courts have already ruled that ballots that do not reach election commissions by November 3 will not be valid.
With an overwhelming turnout - nearly 100 million voters prematurely - it could ""miss"" a large number of votes cast, mostly democratic, which could result in close results (the Republican won in 2016 with just 77,000 votes in three states). ) decide the election. Trump cries out all the time about the scam - he may not be very precise about who is to blame for it."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kaj-vse-zajema-zadnji-predlog-koalicijske-pogodbe-marjana-sarca.html,This is the content of the latest proposal of the coalition agreement of Marjan Šarc,"LMŠ sent the last draft of the coalition agreement to potential partners. On 30 pages, there is a universal basic income for all underage citizens, raising the minimum full-time pension to at least € 620, ensuring a minimum maternity leave regardless of employment status, € 150 million to eliminate healthcare queues and more redundancies in the labor market .","Representatives of SD, SMC, NSi, SAB and DeSUS took over the proposal of the coalition agreement from LMŠ today, and by Tuesday they are expected to prepare an overview of the comments, which will be discussed at the continuation of negotiations on Tuesday morning.
Reducing queues in healthcare will be a priority
Although the LMŠ wants the proposal of the coalition agreement to remain confidential, its content has been leaked to the public this time as well. It shows that one of the biggest challenges will be to change the health care system in which they intend to bring regulated competitiveness. The priority will be to reduce queues, and the national program for the elimination of queues should include public institutions, concessionaires and private individuals, with the main criterion being the most cost-effective offer.
As stated in the proposal, they will open an expert discussion on different models of health insurance restructuring. A commitment to pass a law on long-term care remains in place, and the network of homes for the elderly would be supplemented with private ones. Gradually, the minimum pension should be raised.
Tax relief of 13th and 14th salaries
The draft coalition agreement also states the goal of relieving the salaries of the most productive and developmentally important personnel. The 13th and 14th salaries would also be relieved of taxes. However, labor law would be changed in the direction of easier adjustment of employers and greater flexibility. It should also simplify the employment of foreigners.
Transparent, professional and responsible management of infrastructure investments would be ensured by examining, in cooperation with the profession, the feasibility of establishing a strategic expert council for infrastructure, whose tasks will include determining the investment priorities of public infrastructure projects. The Council would act publicly and transparently, thus preventing the influence of lobbies and interest groups so far. In addition, the role and responsibility of DRI would be more clearly defined than t. i. in-house engineer for state public infrastructure projects, and transparently establish cash flows by introducing cost engineering on the part of the client and quarterly or. half-yearly informing the public about the progress of the project.
Start of construction of the 2nd track
The contract also envisages the start of the construction of the 2nd track on the planned route with the construction of a double-track line. Among the planned measures are supplementing the existing building permit for the expansion of service pipes, approving the investment program and starting the construction of access roads, starting the DPN procedure for the double-track line, continuing the work of the established government project council for civil control, completing the procedure with the European Investment Bank establishment of cash flows flows with the introduction of cost engineering on the part of the client and quarterly or. half-yearly informing the public about the progress of the project.
Probationary period of judges
The treaty also includes changes to the judicial mandate - they will propose an amendment to the Constitution in the direction of introducing a probationary period for judges and the appointment of judges by the President of the Republic or directly by the Judicial Council.
In order to increase the efficiency and quality of the work of the judiciary, the powers and responsibilities regarding the tasks to be performed by the Judicial Administration and the implementation of court activities would be more precisely divided, while ensuring better cooperation, judicial legislation to ""not change from week to week"" and to continue to eliminate backlogs, while ensuring that economic disputes are given priority in resolving those in which a lengthy trial would lead to insolvency and job losses. .
It would also increase the accountability of judges and prosecutors for wrong and too slow decisions. Personnel councils set up by the courts would play a key role in assessing the work of judges.
More powers for the police and the prosecution
The Criminal Procedure Code would be amended in the part of the judicial investigation so that it would be more effective. The possibility of conferring more powers on the police and the prosecution in the field of obtaining evidence would be examined, ensuring the principle of equality before the law, and paying special attention to victims of crime and their position in criminal proceedings.
In the field of migration, the coalition agreement envisages the transfer of competencies of the Office for the Care and Integration of Migrants to the Ministry of the Interior and the amendment of asylum legislation with clear safeguards to prevent abuses of the Institute for International Protection.
What is not in the contract and why?
The LMŠ therefore wrote a rather general coalition agreement. This is content that the ideologically written six potential partners - roughly - can agree on. With a few exceptions.
In any case, the text is far from the project contract that Šarec talked about before the coordination. For example, there is no longer a planned financial audit of the outgoing government's key infrastructure project - the 2nd track. Nothing is written about the fate of 2 TDK, nor is it defined what will happen with the participation of neighboring Hungary. Which Cerar's SMC achieved. Another ideological topic that they preferred to put under the rug: public or. private education. It is a reaction to the decision of the Constitutional Court, which could ignite a serious ideological dispute between NSi and SD, but the coalition agreement does not address this topic. Logic: all for peace between partners.
It has already been heard from individual parties that they are not yet completely satisfied with the text of the coalition agreement proposal, and that key topics are expected to lack amounts, deadlines and calculations. At the same time, there is optimism that the details will be harmonized at Tuesday's meeting, at least to the extent that the proposal will also be considered by the authorities of some parties later this week.
The NSi executive committee has already been convened for Tuesday evening, but will not yet make a final decision on the party's possible entry into the coalition. The party council must decide on this, and the key word will be given to its members in an internal referendum, as announced by the party. On Thursday, the SD presidency will also discuss current issues, including coalition negotiations.
Who would take over which ministry?
After the harmonization of the content, if it happens, the parties will have to bite into the sour apple of the government's personnel image. There are quite a few possibilities about party wishes.
According to Radio Slovenia, SMC president Miro Cerar could still get the post of parliamentary speaker, while NSi president Matej Tonin could get one of the state-building ministries, probably foreign or defense. SD president Dejan Židan is said to be interested in the economic department, while SAB president Alenka Bratušek could become deputy prime minister for the coordination of health, labor and finance departments. According to this version, NSi could also get a judicial, SMC infrastructure, and SD a school or minister responsible for science."

Janez Janša said that coalition agreements will come into force only when the President of the Republic decides whether and to whom he will grant a mandate to form a government. He added that they have had several talks with other parties so far, although he has not released which ones. ""It is true that only Nova Slovenija came up with open questions, in such a way that they knew what was written in our program, we knew what was written in theirs, where the points of contact and differences are,"" he added.
Janša estimates that talks with other parties with the aim of forming a coalition agreement will only be possible in the second phase. According to him, the first round is about testing whether the parties are ready to sign a coalition agreement and whether they have adequate human resources for this mandate, in which the EU Council will also have to be led. ""It is not only important that someone writes something down on paper, it is also important for us whether they have people who are able to lead not only ministries but also the relevant composition of the EU Council. If we find that such a willingness exists, a kind of substantive harmonization, ""he explained.
He says that the SDS has prepared 14 negotiators with teams and a draft coalition agreement has already been prepared, so they can carry out this procedure as soon as possible.
The leader of the party that won the most votes in the parliamentary elections does not see anything wrong in the talks between the six parties led by Šarec. ""If a dilemma is resolved before formal proceedings begin, the better, these proceedings will be faster. If it is found that someone else can form a majority sooner than we who won this election, then we will We won't even bother with that. So no conversation is superfluous. """

Although he was second in the elections, Marjan Šarec has 50 pages of the coalition agreement written, which he will start coordinating with potential coalition partners, and a complex personnel crossword puzzle of the 5 + 1 party, as Šarec imagined, is starting.","""We have this ready. But when we sit together with our partners, we will determine the way we work. That is, we would like it to be done together. If we throw something on the table and do not give up, then there will be no success. , ""says the president of LMŠ Marjan Šarec.
SAB President Alenka Bratušek replies that they expect a draft coalition agreement and that they know what their demands are. ""This is a very precise definition of health care and the regulation of pensions,"" says Bratuškova.
The more parties, the more interests need to be reconciled
But how to reconcile the six parties in the coalition? For comparison: we had three in this term, but we saw how it went and how many reforms they adopted.
Personnel and interest combinatorics will really be very complicated. In addition to the possible prime minister-designate Šarc, there are two former prime ministers (Miro Cerar and Bratuškova), at least three candidates for economy minister (Vojmir Urlep, Dejan Židan and Zdravko Počivalšek), and the prestigious position of foreign minister.
There is also the right-wing Nova Slovenija, which must first convince its membership in order to cooperate with the left-wing political camp. In this light, the statement of the age-old Slovene politician Ivan Oman, who supported Matej Tonin and the Christian Democrats before the elections, is also very significant. In an interview with national television on Saturday, he called for a ""government of integration that would connect left and right"". He added that it is good that the relative winner Janez Janša does not have an absolute majority, as this forces them to unite, not to divide.
On Wednesday, President Borut Pahor will hold talks with the new President of the National Assembly, Tonin, on the process of forming a new government."

Janša's SDS is growing strongly among political parties after the elections. The second with more than half the support is Šarčeva LMŠ, the third place went to Levica. On the scale of politicians, however, the elections considerably shuffled the order.","Miro Cerar's government is leaving with a medium impression. Three months after the resignation of the Prime Minister, his team, which only performs current business, is supported by slightly more than every third respondent (36.8 percent). Just under half (49.1 percent) remain dissatisfied, 14 percent (more precisely - 14.1 percent) are undecided.
Janša's SDS is growing strongly among political parties after the elections. If the election were held tomorrow, the relative winner of the early election would convince even more people than last month - almost one in four (24.7 percent). The second with more than half the support is Šarčeva LMŠ, which is supported by ten (10.1) percent of respondents, while the Left (8.4 percent) jumped to third place.
They are followed by Židan's Social Democrats (8.2 percent), Cerar's SMC (5.6 percent), Tonin's Christian Democrats (4.6 percent) and Jelinčič's National Party (3.8 percent). Alenka Bratušek's party and Desus are also above two percent of support.
And still undecided. A good 13 percent (13.3 percent) of respondents do not know which party to choose. Just over six percent (6.4 percent) would choose none, and three percent were reluctant to answer.
On the scale of politicians, the elections have shuffled the order considerably. The first place is once again reserved for the President of the Republic Borut Pahor, and the second place is reserved for the 'cemented' European Commissioner Violeta Bulc.
Former President of the National Assembly Milan Brglez jumped to third place, followed by his successor and NSi champion Matej Tonin. The head of the LMŠ, Marjan Šarec, obviously did not become famous by trying to form a coalition and slipped to fifth place. They are followed by SD champion Dejan Židan, the first face of the Left Luka Mesec, old and new NSi deputies Ljudmila Novak and Alenka Bratušek. Outgoing Prime Minister Miro Cerar is 12th, SDS President Janez Janša is 14th, and Franc Kangler is finishing the list."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kdo-bo-12-predsednik-dz-se-bo-ponovilo-leto-2011.html,Newly elected Speaker Matej Tonin: NSi will continue to hold talks with both sides,"At the inaugural session, the newly elected deputies of the eighth convocation of the National Assembly elected Matej Tonin as the new president. The NSi president received 80 votes in a secret ballot, with only nine deputies voting against. Tonin does not link the election to NSi's entry into the center-left coalition and emphasizes that he will continue to hold talks with both sides.","After today's coordination, just before the start of the inaugural session of the new convocation of the National Assembly, the president of the LMŠ, Marjan Šarec, explained that they intend to propose NSi president Matej Tonin as the interim president of the National Assembly. In addition to LMŠ, his candidacy was also supported by SD, DeSUS, SAB, SMC and NSi, confirmed LMŠ. Tonin needed at least 46 deputies to be elected, but he received as many as 80. Only nine deputies voted against.
""Parliament is able to unite in key moments and this is a positive message for the Slovenian public,"" NSi champion Matej Tonin commented on his election as parliamentary speaker. He also says that his election does not mean that these are not necessarily the outlines of the center-left coalition, and emphasizes that NSi will continue to talk to both sides. He said that they had not yet had substantive talks with LMŠ, and with Janša's SDS. It will all depend on the coordination of the programs.
As Speaker of the National Assembly, Tonin wants the formation of parliamentary committees, especially the Foreign Policy Committee, as soon as possible, due to the lawsuit against Croatia before the EU court. This is followed by the election of vice-presidents, and Tonin will do his best to ensure that the procedures for appointing the future government are as smooth as possible.
He became the twelfth President of the National Assembly in the history of an independent state. He is taking up this position a good month before his 35th birthday. But he is not the youngest speaker of parliament. Jožef Školč was a few months younger, coming to this place less than a month after his 34th birthday in 1994.
Until the election of the President, the first session of the new convocation of the National Assembly was chaired by the oldest member of parliament, Peter Jožef Česnik (SAB), and the Mandate-Election Commission by Jože Tanko (SDS).
Šarec, who ranked second behind the SDS in the recent parliamentary elections with his LMŠ, explained in a statement to the media that the proposal for Tonin's candidacy was coordinated between the mentioned parties of the potential coalition. ""Of course, there is still a long way to go,"" he said of forming a coalition.
At the same time, Šarec, who will be the first to sign under Tonin's candidacy, emphasized that they agreed that this was a temporary proposal, and expressed the expectation that Tonin would resign from the presidency if agreed in coalition coordination. According to him, it would not be good for democracy and the general understanding of politics if they were dealing with the appointment of the President of the National Assembly for a long time today.
""Lightning can also strike the National Assembly today, anything is possible in this world,"" he said of the possibility that Tonin would not want to withdraw. Tonin did not give a statement to the media before the session.
SMC President Miro Cerar emphasized that it was essential for them to take ""the first, decisive steps towards forming a stable central coalition"". As he assured, they will continue to be constructive in this regard and will not insist on proposals that would undermine such a consensus. In recent days, Miro Cerar and the current Speaker of the National Assembly Milan Brglez, also an SMC MP, have been mentioned as possible candidates for the Speaker of the National Assembly.
According to Cerar, the joint decision to support Tonin is an ""expression of great trust"". Tonin assures that he only wants to be the interim Speaker of the National Assembly and that when the coalition is formed, a final agreement will have to be reached on ""how we will represent certain contents in certain positions"".
He added that today they found that they needed an interim president who could be supported by a sufficient number of votes. ""This also indicates the outlines of a new central coalition,"" he explained. According to Cerar, after today's first step, Šarec will find it easier to coordinate work in forming this coalition.
Alenka Bratušek Party MP Marko Bandelli also announced his support for Šarč's candidate for parliamentary speaker. According to him, this decision will be accompanied by further coalition negotiations. Bandelli advocates a central government, which he sees as the only option, in which ""wisdom prevails over individualism"".
Franc Jurša, the leader of the DeSUS parliamentary group, also has a positive opinion of Tonin, saying that despite his youth, Tonin will be able to lead the National Assembly ""for the time allotted to him"". Regarding the fact that Tonin may not resign from the post of president, he said that Tonin ""cannot resign himself, he can be removed by the deputies"".
Janša: ""By supporting Tonin, we are solving the dilemma of the left""
According to NSi MP Jernej Vrtovec, the party wants to cut the Gordian knot created after the elections with the candidacy of Matej Tonin for the parliamentary speaker. “Sometimes it is necessary to overcome divisions, especially ideological ones, and look at what is good for the people and the country,” he explained. NSi's participation in the government coalition, however, depends on the agreements, he added.
In a statement to the media on the sidelines of today's session, Vrtovec said that NSi had decided to act inclusively, not exclusively, and to raise the level of discussion. ""Tonin is a person who includes and who can go beyond left-right divisions,"" Vrtovec stressed. He is convinced that Tonin will be a good Speaker of the National Assembly and will perform this function responsibly and conscientiously.
As for the further operation of NSi, according to Vrtovac, it depends on further negotiations. ""Whether Nova Slovenija will be part of the ruling coalition does not depend on human resources, staffing, but on the content of the coalition agreement and what we will be able to agree on,"" he said.
Asked whether the NSi was closer to the left or the right in terms of content, Vrtovec said that they had not yet started discussing the content with any political party, with the exception of certain tactics. At the same time, he explained that their economic program is very clear and is also the basis for their negotiations.
NSi president Matej Tonin can also count on the support of SDS deputies in his candidacy for the post of parliamentary speaker. SDS leader Janez Janša wrote on Twitter that for the time being they are solving ""the dilemma of the so-called left, which is only able to agree on someone who is not theirs"".
Hope and trust of the people
The session began with an address by President Borut Pahor. ""People have entrusted us with their hopes and trusts. We are charged to protect and develop our country and homeland together,"" he said, adding that ""our mutual cooperation is essential to strengthen confidence in democracy, the state and politics.""
In his address to the deputies, Pahor said that ""the security of our country, the well-being of its people and Slovenia's reputation in the world will greatly depend on our ability and willingness to cooperate"". ""We are elected by people who have different views. We have different views. No one has the right to force us to renounce our opinion. However, we have a state vocation to respect and reconcile these differences,"" he said.
He pointed out that this year he and the National Assembly have some common tasks ahead of them, the first being the formation of a new government. The President of the Republic must propose a candidate for Prime Minister no later than 30 days after the constitution of the National Assembly. However, he will not delay the proposal unnecessarily, but will inform the National Assembly about it as soon as possible, he announced.
He reiterated that in talks with the leaders of the parliamentary groups he would check whether there was enough principled support in the National Assembly to entrust the mandate to the leader of the largest parliamentary party, Janez Janša. In this case, he will sign a proposal for his candidacy for prime minister in early July and officially send it to the National Assembly. However, if he finds out that someone else enjoys the necessary parliamentary majority, he would invite Janša to an interview again, as he has already informed him that he would not accept the mandate in this case.
At best, we could get a government at the end of August, which means that half a year will pass between the two governments with full powers. According to Pahor, during this time, issues have been accumulating that are waiting to be resolved. ""Therefore, it is clear that the election of a new government as soon as possible would be useful and encouraging for Slovenia,"" he said, adding that the process of forming a government is always demanding and complicated. Therefore, it strives to be at least as transparent and predictable as possible.
The position of Speaker of the National Assembly is traditionally part of coalition replays
Since its establishment in December 1992, the National Assembly has been chaired by eleven presidents, who have exchanged seven parliamentary terms. Feri Horvat and Ljubo Germič, who chaired the highest legislative body for just over three months, sat on the chair of the National Assembly for the shortest time.
According to the protocol, the President of the National Assembly is the second most important person in the country. Elected by a majority vote of all deputies, he represents the highest state legislative body and leads its work. The position is considered prestigious among politicians, so it has always been part of coalition coordination.
After the first parliamentary elections in 1992, Herman Rigelnik from the largest government party, the LDS, took over, but after 1996, the practice was established that the second largest coalition party would take over. At that time, it belonged to Janez Podobnik from the SLS, who entered the government led by the LDS.
After 2000, the government was again composed of the LDS, and the position of the Speaker of the National Assembly was given to the second largest coalition party, the ZLSD (now the SD). Borut Pahor, who is also the only one to hold all three presidential positions in the country, held most of his mandate - he was also the Prime Minister, and today he is the President of the Republic. Even when the government was formed by the SD after the 2008 elections, he left the position of parliamentary speaker to his coalition partner Zares and Pavel Gantar.
In 2004, when the SDS won the election, the party took over both the government and the National Assembly. France Cukjati became the first MP.
It was the same four years ago, although even then it looked different. Namely, the candidacy was initially announced by the president of DeSUS Karl Erjavec, but then he changed his mind. Among the reasons at the time was uncertainty about the composition of the new coalition and the division of key functions. Milan Brglez from the election-winning SMC then became the Speaker of the National Assembly.
The most complicated was in 2011
The inaugural session of the National Assembly after the 2011 elections was the most varied. Borut Pahor (SD) ran in the first and second rounds. In addition to the SD, he was supported by the parties SLS and NSi, and DeSUS deputies voted according to their conscience. The winner of the elections - Positive Slovenia - ran with her MP Maša Kociper, but remained alone in both attempts to vote in support. Meanwhile, SDS deputies did not support any candidate in the first two votes. In the third round, however, there was a shift. Pahor did not run again, but the SD decided to support Kociprova, which was still not enough. The president of the Virant List, Gregor Virant, and the president of DeSUS, Karl Erjavec, were appalled by what was happening and said that it was best to find an agreement that would enable the constitution of the National Assembly. Therefore, Virant entered the candidacy, receiving the support of the ad hoc coalition of the Virant List, SDS, SLS, DeSUS and NSi. It was this coalition that, after the failed attempt of the President of the Parliamentary Assembly Zoran Janković, formed a government led by the President of the SDS Janez Janša. After the dissolution of the government coalition, the government was formed by the PS with Alenka Bratušek, and the position of the president of the National Assembly was again won by the second largest coalition party SD.
The position of Speaker of Parliament is honorable, but also very well paid
According to the Rules of Procedure, the President of the National Assembly represents the National Assembly, convenes and chairs the sessions of the National Assembly, signs laws and other acts adopted by the National Assembly. government and other state bodies, takes care of cooperation with representative bodies of other countries, international parliamentary institutions and international bodies and organizations, takes care of the implementation of the Rules of Procedure, assigns matters to working bodies, decides on disputes over competences between working bodies and decides on official bodies. the travel of Members abroad if no such working body is competent to take such a decision. The President of the National Assembly is ranked in the highest, 65th salary grade and is entitled to a salary of EUR 5,419 gross."

Cerar's SMC will insist on the proposal that the outgoing Prime Minister become the new Speaker of the National Assembly. What are the chances of this proposal succeeding? On the other hand, the winner of the elections, Janša, was already drinking a coalition agreement - they spent two hours with NSi president Matej Tonin on this topic.","The leaders of politically related parties from the 'right' took a detailed walk through the SDS coalition agreement and listed quite a few common points, but they have not yet concluded any final political alliances.
Even today, Janez Janša did not comment on whether he might nominate a candidate for a possible coalition for the new head of parliament on Friday.
Miro Cerar, on the other hand, remains a serious contender for the same position. The SMC will not propose him for this on its own, as it would be so easy to risk literally destroying its candidate in the event of too few votes. Thus, they expect that the LMŠ will propose him for this position and provide him with the necessary 46 votes for the election, otherwise the SMC will understand this as a vote of no confidence in the party. The decision on a possible joint candidate of the left parties will supposedly be made on Thursday, after additional talks between the party presidents.
Mentioning the name of Miro Cerar, Dejan Židan hinted that it might be worth looking for another name from the left parties that would make it easier for Marjan Šarc to form a coalition - unofficially they have in mind the current Speaker of Parliament Milan Brglez."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/3-500-evrov-nadomestila-mesecno-za-nekdanje-poslance-brez-sluzbe.html,"3,500 euros a month in allowances for former members of the unemployed","As of the beginning of next week, 54 deputies will no longer sit on the bench of the National Assembly. We checked who can exercise the right to parliamentary compensation, who cannot and why it is sometimes better to be silent.","Some have already announced the receipt of compensation, others condemn receiving it on social networks and in the media, and still others are silent. It will soon be clear who will receive how much. Bojan Dobovšek is also saying goodbye to the parliamentary ranks, convincing 1.52 percent of voters with the newly established Good State. With this result, he provided the party with several thousand a month until the re-election.
The Faculty of Security Sciences of the University of Maribor has confirmed that Bojan Dobovšek is returning to academia after the end of his parliamentary term. They explained that in his case, legally, it is not a question of re-employment, but of reactivation of the employment relationship, which was dormant during the parliamentary term on the basis of the suspension of the employment contract. Which means that Dobovšek will not use the right to parliamentary compensation, as it does not even belong to him.
Right to compensation
The right to salary compensation is regulated by the Deputies Act. The allowance thus belongs to Members whose term of office has expired and, for objective reasons, such as re-election, they cannot continue their previous work or obtain other suitable employment and do not meet the minimum conditions for retirement.
He is entitled to an allowance of 80 per cent of the last salary a Member has received while in office for a maximum of six months from the end of his term, which may be extended until his retirement is met, but for a maximum of six more months. In a slightly better position are those who held the office of deputy before the expiring term. For each previous consecutive term, they are entitled to an additional three-month salary allowance, but not more than six months in total. In total, therefore, a Member can receive the allowance for a maximum of 18 months.
Who doesn't have that right?
If, for example, we do not get a new government within six months after all the legally prescribed attempts, President Borut Pahor will dissolve the National Assembly and call new elections, and newly elected deputies will not be entitled to salary compensation. The same applies, as we explained in the case of Bojan Dobovšek, to deputies who were employed until the confirmation of their mandate and whose rights and obligations arising from this employment relationship on the basis of an agreement with the employer are suspended.
Amount of compensation
The amount of the deputy's allowance is set at 80 percent of the last salary that the deputy received when he held office. If we take as a starting point the average April salary in the amount of EUR 4,364.86, we find that a deputy with an otherwise average MP salary would receive compensation in the amount of EUR 3,491.89.
The period of receipt of the allowance for a member whose term of office has expired shall also be counted as length of service. During this time, he is socially insured in accordance with the regulations governing the social insurance of persons in employment, and upon retirement he is entitled to severance pay.
However, a deputy receiving an allowance is not entitled to holiday pay, separation allowance, a monthly flat rate to cover the costs of performing the function of a deputy in a constituency and the like.
Dobovšek to the faculty, Bizjak Mlakar will be an actuary again, Gorenak will write, Čuš to the local elections
Like Dobovšek, former Minister of Culture and MP Julijana Bizjak Mlakar is returning to her old post after two terms. The day after the expiration of her parliamentary term, she will again become a certified actuary at the Insurance Supervision Agency. Vinko Gorenak, a long-time SDS MP, told our television that he was systematically running in Celje, an ineligible district for him, as he is retiring to write books. Another former SDS MP, most recently an independent MP, was more disappointed with the outcome of the elections. He wanted to cross the parliamentary threshold with the Green Party. Andrej Čuš has already announced the temporary receipt of the allowance, and at the same time indicated his candidacy in the local elections.
The list of Members of Parliament who received salary compensation after the end of their parliamentary term in the 2011-2014 term of office can be viewed here.

Intellectuals also warn against re-elections, which would ""push voters back into tactical voting beyond the choice of substantive differences in order to prevent authoritarian political formations from gaining power."" The statement appeals to the SMC, LMŠ, SD, Levica, Alenka Bratušek and DeSUS parties to form a coalition government.
""Of course, such a coalition will be as demanding as democracy itself.

Jelinčič on the formation of the center-left coalition: ""Comets are also coming, but we don't know what will happen with that.""
The president of the second-ranked LMŠ party also met with the president of the SNS, Zmag Jelinčič. Jelinčič believes that they have a lot in common, as they both want to help Slovenia. He said that he and Šarc talked mainly about forming a government and rescuing Slovenia, which is ""in heavy trouble"".
Asked whether he would support the candidate for president of the National Assembly, who will be proposed by the center-left coalition, he answered that there is no such coalition yet. Noting that this coalition is in the making, he replied: ""Comets are coming too, but we don't know what will happen with that."" Jelinčič believes that the center-left coalition would be a coalition in itself, saying that most parties think only of their own well-being and not of what is good to do for Slovenia.
Marjan Šarec also said that the National Assembly would have to be constituted first, adding that he was in no hurry to appoint the President of the National Assembly. ""If there is a will, we will elect the president at the first session, but if there is no will, then nothing will happen by force,"" he said, but at the same time confirmed that he would do everything to make it happen. According to him, the decision on whether to support the SD or SMC candidate for the National Assembly has not yet been made, as it is too early. However, he announced that a lot will happen by Friday. He said he had not yet invited party representatives who had expressed readiness to participate in the center-left government under his leadership to a joint table.
He adds that there was no communication noise between him and the president of the SMC, Miro Cerar, and that talks are ongoing. At the same time, he emphasizes the informality of the talks so far and that the real composition of the coalition and talks on ministerial posts will begin only on Friday, when the National Assembly will be constituted.
Jelinčič's victory is still of interest to him as Minister of Culture, as he believes that much can be done in this area.
Šarec also touched on the question of whether the decision on the lawsuit against Croatia for non-compliance with the arbitral award on the border should be made by the current outgoing government or the new government. ""What needs to be done, of course, cannot wait for the next government,"" he said. He reiterated that the European Commission should do more in this case and that it is not a matter of taking the Slovenian or Croatian side, but of the rule of law."

Find out what challenges the EU is facing and what are the initiatives that the population has identified as most beneficial.","A year before the European elections, the Eurobarometer shows that confidence in the EU and optimism about the future are rising among Europeans.
Half of Europeans continue to have a positive view of the state of the European economy, the best result since 2007. In the 25 Member States, the majority of respondents believe that the state of the European economy is good. For the first time since spring 2007, however, a positive opinion on the state of the national economy outweighed a negative one, although there are large differences between countries. Support for economic and monetary union and the euro is also at a record high.
Confidence in the EU is growing at 42 percent. Since autumn 2017, it has strengthened in 19 countries, especially in Portugal and Slovenia, where it increased by 6 percentage points. 40 percent of Europeans have a positive view of the EU, and trust in the EU remains higher than trust in national governments or parliaments. A majority of Europeans, 58 per cent to be precise, are also optimistic about the future of the EU, as are all EU countries except Greece and the United Kingdom. According to 58% and 54% of Europeans, respectively, the free movement of persons, goods and services within the EU and peace between EU Member States are the two most positive achievements of the EU.
At national level, the main issues are unemployment, health and social security, and immigration. Europeans have also shown strong support for the European Commission's priorities, such as free movement and the common defense and security policy. Compared to 2014, more citizens believe that they benefit from key EU initiatives."

Šarec met with the coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesc, and Janša called the leader of the SD deputies, Matjaž Han.","After the meeting, the current Speaker of the National Assembly Milan Brglez explained in a press statement that an inaugural session had been agreed, which would include three mandatory items: election of the President and Vice-President of the Mandate-Election Commission, confirmation of mandates and election of the Speaker. They also determined the seating order in the parliamentary hall, which, according to Brglez, was not a problem, although there was no full agreement between the parliamentary groups before the meeting.
Difficulties are evident in the election of a new speaker of parliament
However, problems are indicated at the most important item on the agenda of Friday's session, ie the election of a new president. Judging by the statements of the interim leaders of the parliamentary groups, it is unlikely that talks on possible coalition cooperation would lead to the point that the National Assembly could elect a new president.
They are also silent about the names of potential candidates in the parties.
Specifically, Šarec has not yet decided who will be supported as the Speaker of the National Assembly at the inaugural session of the National Assembly. Who will take the presidency in the National Assembly was usually tied to the election result, Šarec said, but added that it was all a matter of agreements, ""nothing is final, no one has closed the door"", and there are still a few days until Friday.
He reiterated, however, that the LMŠ as a party will not propose its candidate for parliament speaker.
The leader of the SD deputies, Matjaž Han, explained that they do not have a name, otherwise ""whatever I would say, I would say too much"", as it is all a matter of agreements and talks that will take place after Friday. However, in his opinion, it is also possible to suspend the inaugural session on Friday and wait a few more days to decide on a new president.
According to the interim leader of the NSi deputies Matej Tonin, there is also a high probability that the President of the National Assembly will not be elected on Friday. With no agreement on the future coalition yet, Toni has a feeling that none of the candidates will be elected. The president of NSi does not rule out the possibility of running for office.
The SMC is a bit more optimistic, as according to the interim leader Igor Zorčič, there is a possibility that, after additional talks this week, they would formulate a proposal for a joint candidate. According to Zorčič, if this is the president of the SMC Miro Cerar, he will be a joint candidate of a possible center-left coalition. According to Zorčič, the possibility of proposing Cerar as a candidate to the SDS is not realistic.
According to Alenka Bratušek's party, according to the interim leader of the parliamentary group Marko Bandelli, they expect that the LMŠ will nominate a candidate for the National Assembly. They would also support the candidate of this party, although Bandelli also expects that the elected president of the National Assembly on Friday would perform the function only temporarily. According to him, the SDS candidate would not be supported.
Such a candidate would not be supported even in the Left, announced the interim leader of the parliamentary group Matej T. Vatovec, but it is more likely that they would support a candidate from other parties. Zmago Jelinčič (SNS) says that it will be very difficult for them to decide on support for the presidential candidate, as he believes that there will be at least three or four candidates who will compete with each other.
The leader of the DeSUS parliamentary group, Franc Jurša, is convinced that the largest parliamentary group should be the main winner in the election of the President of the National Assembly. If she fails to do so, the second biggest one will come, he added.
Representatives of SDS and LMŠ did not make any statements after today's meeting at Brglez.
Miro Cerar is said to want the position
It is unofficially mentioned that the current Prime Minister Miro Cerar wants the position of President of the National Assembly.
Cerar confirmed today that the SMC ""expressed its intention to nominate him for the post of Speaker of the National Assembly, and that is all."" He thus rejected media reports that the SMC made its participation in the coalition led by the LMŠ conditional on this appointment and the allocation of some SMC ministerial posts.
At a press conference aimed at responding to the European Commission's actions regarding the execution of the arbitration award, Cerar said that a lot of information published in the media was inaccurate.
Among other things, he reiterated that the party he leads will not participate in the coalition with the SDS. He also said this in an informative telephone conversation with SDS leader Janez Janša, who was interested in the position of the SMC after the elections. ""To date, however, I have not received any proposal from Janša regarding the coalition agreement or departments,"" he said.
As he said, the SMC supports the formation of a center-left government ""and now that it is known that Marjan Šarec wants to form this government, we have given him full support to do so and we are ready to work with him in this center-left government. Šarec put on the table a proposal for a coalition agreement and that we will start discussing the contents and, of course, the departments, ""Cerar said.
He said that a group of parties wishing to form a coalition must also agree on the Speaker of the National Assembly, and that Marjan Šarec should lead this process. “Let’s give time time,” he added.
So who could become the new Speaker of Parliament?
As our journalist Anže Božič reported, the possibilities and interests of who will become the new Speaker of the National Assembly are almost as many as there are parties in parliament. The first is Miro Cerar, for whom this would be the most elegant way to step down as prime minister. And it doesn’t matter who would suggest it. If it is proposed by Janša's SDS, the proposal falls. If he is proposed by Šarec, they have problems in the SD, where they would like to nominate either the current vice-president Matjaž Nemec or the party's champion Dejan Židan. There is also Matej Tonin, who could also be suggested by either the left or the right. He, too, made no secret of his interest in the situation today. But every prime minister wants party leaders in government, otherwise the government is weaker. The solution of some kind of interim Speaker of Parliament is also possible, but unlikely, but there is not enough trust between the parties to be able to vote for a new one in this case.
The National Assembly will be constituted when more than half of the seats are confirmed, ie at least 46. This also ends the term of the previous convocation of parliament.
If the deputies do not elect a new parliamentary speaker on Friday, the oldest member of parliament, Peter Jožef Česnik from the Alenka Bratušek Party, will temporarily hold the office of chairman, who will also chair the inaugural session. In this case, he would chair the solemn session of the National Assembly before the day of statehood, which will be on Sunday, and he would have a solemn speech at it.
At today's meeting, the leaders of the parliamentary groups also agreed on the composition of the mandate-election commission, which has an important role to play in the inaugural session of the National Assembly. The position of president will at least temporarily belong to the largest parliamentary group, the SDS, and the candidate for this position will be the current leader of the SDS parliamentary group, Jože Tanko.
Negotiations on a new government coalition are continuing
The issue of the candidate for the post of Speaker of the National Assembly is closely connected with the outlines of the future coalition, which is still quite unknown at the moment. Talks on possible cooperation are taking place all the time, which was also confirmed by the interim leaders of the parliamentary groups."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/pahor-bo-sklical-ustanovno-sejo-dz-desus-o-usodi-erjavca.html,Karl Erjavec remains the head of DeSUS: he was supported by both the executive committee and the party council,"The DeSUS council decided on the fate of party president Karel Erjavec, who offered his resignation after a poor election result. The party's top leadership expected him to back with 12 votes in favor and two against. He was also allowed to stay in office by the party council - supported by 44 of the 57 council members present.","Today, the DeSUS council did not accept the resignation of the party's president, Karel Erjavec, who offered it due to the poor result in the last parliamentary elections. Erjavec's stay at the helm of the party was supported by 44 of the 57 council members present. However, it is also clear that DeSUS will not enter the center-right government.
In a statement for the media after the council session, Erjavec assessed that the high support of the council and before that of the executive committee was a good guide for further work in the party. ""With such a journey, I can continue to lead the party successfully and efficiently. I think the party can now go with fresh zeal to new challenges that will not run out during this period,"" he said.
He reminded that they are preparing for the November local elections, and before that there are agreements on a new government coalition. He reiterated that the DeSUS party was ready to participate in the center-left government, but not in the center-right government. ""But negotiations will be arduous,"" he admitted.
“It can happen that in the end there will be a minority government,” the DeSUS champion said. Sam does not believe that the NSi would join the center-left coalition. On the Left, however, he said they have ""some very specific requirements"" regarding the removal of the fence at the border, the reduction of defense resources and the withdrawal from NATO. “It’s hard to say whether they will give up their standards set during the election campaign,” he said. However, according to him, one of the possibilities is for the Left to support the minority government.
It also seems that working in the coalition will be hard, no matter what it is. Especially because the new government is facing tasks that will have to be coordinated with a large number of parties, Erjavec reminded, pointing out, among other things, negotiations with public sector unions and decisions on the ownership of the NLB.
He assessed that Cerar's government was successful
Regarding the future Speaker of the National Assembly, he added that the unwritten rule is that the candidate is offered by the second strongest party in the coalition. SMC President Miro Cerar has all the qualifications for this, but the problem would be that the SMC is not ranked second among the parties of a possible center-left coalition, he explained. In addition, he said, party presidents should also be members of the government.
Erjavec said today that the outgoing government had achieved good results. ""I think people will only realize over time how good and successful the government of Miro Cerar has been,"" he said. Asked about his criticism of Cerar in the election campaign, he explained that he was particularly critical of Cerar's surprising resignation.
Erjavec also finds it interesting that in the last elections they lost the most in SMC and DeSUS, ""who were the creators of a successful government"".
He is still convinced that the outcome of the elections would have been different if another party had joined the so-called left-wing bloc, which he concluded with Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković before the elections. At the same time, this signature was one of the most frequently mentioned accusations against Erjavec before today's vote on his resignation, as some in the party estimated that he did not bring them the necessary votes.
If the vote were secret, there would be a little more chance of Erjavec saying goodbye
Despite his stay, they are said to be less satisfied on the ground with the party leader. The majority opinion of the party council was thus less predictable than the vote of the executive committee. The party council consists of 64 members, including leading officials and chairmen of provincial committees, most of whom are elected members of the party's territorial organizations.
Even before the vote, it was said that the result could also depend on whether the vote will be public or secret, and that Erjavec's chair, which he has held since 2005, can only be shaken if the vote is held at a council meeting. parties secretly.
But Erjavec is convinced that the result would be the same as it was now that they voted publicly. Due to the high support, he also sees no point in convening an extraordinary electoral congress of the party, at least not until the end of the year.
Even before today's debate, it was also heard from the party that it is necessary to clarify what exactly is to blame for the poor election result and what is Erjavec's responsibility. On the other hand, some wondered what the alternative to Erjavec at the helm of the party was.
However, from the encouraging tones of some participants in the debate, it could be concluded that Erjavec will remain at the helm of the DeSUS party even after a poor result and, as he put it, a ""personal defeat"" in this year's parliamentary elections.
Erjavec assessed the discussion of the party's bodies as very high quality. In particular, an in-depth analysis of the reasons for the poor election result was carried out at the Executive Committee meeting. ""In politics, there are victories, there are defeats, but it is important that you learn from defeats and move on,"" he explained.
Gantar remains the party's vice president
Erjavec also confirmed that nothing has changed in terms of functions in the party, and that Tomaž Gantar, who took over the leadership of the party when Erjavec's resignation was confirmed, remains its vice-president. Only an early or extraordinary congress could change that, he explained.
Gantar expressed satisfaction with the rather unanimous opinion regarding Erjavec. Certain concerns, he said, remain. However, he is satisfied that Erjavec remains president, especially if his resignation would be an obstacle to joining a possible center-left government.
At the same time, Gantar confirmed that he himself did not vote in support of Erjavec either on the executive committee or on the party council. As he explained, he was ""inadvertently involved in this story"", which would make it, in his opinion, incorrect to vote one way or another.
For Erjavec the worst election so far
The long-time party leader and almost eternal minister has had a really bad election. All the 'stars' of the DeSUS party remained in front of the parliament: Saša Dončič, Lado Leskovar and Peter Vilfan; for the first time since he has been in politics, as well as Erjavec himself, who has undoubtedly lost much of his political weight and reputation. There is also an unfortunate connection with the mayor of Ljubljana, Zoran Janković, and pale appearances at confrontations.
Erjavec himself admits his mistakes: ""I am aware that some mistakes were made on my part during the election campaign, and I take responsibility for that. It certainly turned out that we did not meet those expectations that we thought would This means that we will achieve visibly better results in Ljubljana and some other cities. ""
After 2005, Erjavec was elected party president at congresses in 2009, 2013 and most recently in 2017, when he was also the only candidate for the post.
The coalition of Šarec also depends on the survival of Erjavec
According to Alenka Bratušek's party, talks on a possible coalition with left-wing parties also depended on Erjavec's stay at the helm of the DeSUS party and the reality of the Left's demands. According to the Secretary General of the Alenka Bratušek Party, Jernej Pavlič, the talks are very intense, and calls and meetings take place daily.
Regarding the joint meetings of the three center-left parties, where they are discussing the possibilities of cooperation together with LMŠ and SMC, Pavlič explained at the press conference that this is the beginning of a center bloc that would represent a possible coalition. before an actual agreement is reached.
As he reiterated, they are in favor of a strong center-left coalition, and the key topics are retirees, health and youth. According to them, the coalition program will have to be written down very precisely so that there will be no problems with solutions. ""I believe that we will agree on some outline of the coalition, but then we will have a rather tense conversation about what those substantive points are,"" he said.
Pavlič hopes that the talks between the three will spread to representatives of other parties as soon as possible. Even before the DeSUS council decided on Erejavec's fate, he expressed the belief that it was very important for Erjavec to gain the vote of confidence at the party council meeting, as otherwise ""it could happen that a center-left coalition will not be possible"". Now that the decision in DeSUS is known, however, according to him, the talks will continue. Pavlič estimated that the intentions of the DeSUS party were very different and that the intention of Erjavec's potential successors was to join the right-wing government.
'In terms of content, coalition with NSi easier than with Left'
Asked whether he would prefer NSi or Levica in the coalition that is being formed in its infancy, he answered that ""according to the content logic, a coalition with NSi would be easier than with Levica"". According to him, the latter will also have to take responsibility if the government of Janez Janša is formed, as it makes joining the center-left coalition conditional on some unrealistic demands. As Pavlič estimated, it will be difficult to ""get those few important votes of the Left or NSi"".
According to Pavlič, the troika has not discussed whether they would be ready to enter into a coalition with the SDS. “The desire is for a center-left government,” he stressed. According to him, the Alenka Bratušek Party is ready to talk to everyone, even after the elections they have already heard from all parties in parliament, and met with representatives of the central social-liberal parties. As he explained, they have not yet received any offer from the SDS, but only inquiries as to whether they are ready to talk. ""We don't rule it out because we've learned in politics that you have to talk to everyone, even if you know in advance that you may not agree. But conversation is an important thing, because if you don't, you're in the wrong industry."" because politics is a matter of agreements and talks with everyone, ""he said.
They will support Šarč's proposal for the Speaker of the National Assembly
Regarding the candidate for the National Assembly, he explained that they are aware that they cannot get this seat with five deputies, that it belongs to larger parties and that proposing a candidate is the task of the one who will form the coalition. As he said, they will support Šarč's proposal, as they think it is right if they want to enter into a coalition with him. He asserted that there has been no division of functions in the talks so far, as they must first agree on program issues.
According to him, the new coalition should make healthcare a priority and each party should also appoint a state secretary in this department. The departments that are the most difficult and responsible must belong to the prime minister and the one who has the most votes in the coalition. Because if he belongs to the smallest party and then has no votes in parliament or leverage, he cannot do anything alone. for the finance ministry to belong to the prime minister, the ministry with the most problems must also be the responsibility of the one at the top. ""
According to Pavlič, the party's executive committee also met on Thursday, in which they are ""more than satisfied"" with the election result of 5.11 percent. Congress. Until the congress, Bratuškova, who was not elected to the National Assembly, will hold the position of party president professionally until the congress."

Meanwhile, the President of the Republic Borut Pahor signed an order convening the inaugural session of the new National Assembly, which will take place on 22 June at 11 am.","The SDS, which won the recent parliamentary elections, will prepare a ""draft coalition agreement to be offered for coordination to coalition partners"" in a week's time, Twitter said. According to SDS leader Janez Janša, who does not exclude anyone, it is expected that all parties elected to the National Assembly will receive the draft.
The SDS, which won 25 seats in the elections in early June, is otherwise silent about its post-election activities. The statements of the representatives of some other parties show that they had informal talks with the SDS representatives.
The party announced via Twitter on Thursday evening that an expert council had met to ""assess the results of the elections for which it had prepared a winning program"". At the same time, they announced that a draft coalition agreement will be prepared within a week on the basis of this program, which will be offered for coordination to coalition partners. The SDS confirmed that all parliamentary parties are expected to receive the draft.

Last week, Janša met with the President of the Republic at an informal meeting, after which he announced in a statement for the media that everyone would receive an invitation with some program starting points. He mentioned that nine parties had joined the National Assembly, that such a situation was the result of our distorted proportional electoral system and that it dictated an approach in which all parties were invited to form a government coalition.
At the same time, Janša announced that he would not accept the mandate if it turned out that a majority other than the SDS showed the ability to form a government with the necessary support of deputies.
These days, some parties from the center-left are intensively meeting and coordinating on the formation of a possible center-left government, which would be led by the second-ranked president in this election, LMŠ president Marjan Šarec.
The President of the Republic Pahor convened the inaugural session of the new National Assembly for 22 June
The outlines of a possible new government coalition will also be shown at the inaugural session of the National Assembly during the vote on the President of the National Assembly. Today, after the President of the National Electoral Commission (DVK) Anton Gašper Frantar handed him the official minutes on the outcome of the early parliamentary elections, the President of the Republic Borut Pahor signed an order convening a constituent session of the new National Assembly. This will be on June 22 at 11 a.m., the president's office said. Pahor once again called on political parties for dialogue.
In a statement at the signing of the order convening the inaugural session of the new National Assembly, President Pahor expressed the expectation that parliamentary groups would be formed by the end of June: ""As soon as I am formally informed, I will meet talks on appointing a prime minister-designate for the new government. I expect these talks to take place in late June or early July. ""
In talks with the leaders of the parliamentary groups, Pahor will check whether there is enough principled support in the National Assembly to entrust the mandate to the president of the winning SDS, Janez Janša. ""You are aware of my position that it seems right and fair to me that the champion of the winning party should be the first to have the opportunity to form a government,"" he added.
If Pahor estimates that Janša could get the necessary parliamentary majority, he will sign the proposal for his candidacy for prime minister in early July and officially send it to the National Assembly. ""If I find out in talks with the leaders of the parliamentary groups that someone else enjoys the necessary parliamentary majority, I would invite Mr. Janez Janša to an interview again. He has already informed me and the public that he would not accept the mandate in such circumstances,"" he added. .
In a statement, Pahor also emphasized that the dialogue on the possibilities of forming a government and its program does not mean a necessary commitment to participate in the government. ""However, it creates an atmosphere of high political culture. This enables much-needed conversation and cooperation even after the composition of one or another government,"" the president said. According to him, the process of forming a government goes beyond the importance of electing a government.
""Experience has taught us that dialogue and inclusion enable us to achieve more together, and closing doors and exclusion allows us to achieve less deeply for each other,"" Pahor warned. He added that the process of forming the government is also important for creating one or another atmosphere, which will significantly determine the possibilities for the work of the government, the National Assembly and the entire Slovenian politics in the coming years.
President Pahor also reminded that this year, in addition to the appointment of a new government, Slovenia is also awaiting the election of a new Governor of the Bank of Slovenia and a new constitutional judge.
The President of the National Electoral Commission (DVK), Frantar, was accompanied by the director of the DVK service, Dušan Vučko, when handing over the official minutes on the outcome of the early parliamentary elections. Pahor thanked all those who took care of the flawless conduct of the elections."

Due to the poor result in the elections, he offered his resignation to the party leadership. However, he did not want to speculate on possible scenarios, but stressed that the situation is uncertain at the moment. Tomaž Gantar agreed to temporarily take over the leadership of the party until the congress in case of no confidence in Erjavec.","DeSUS President Karl Erjavec admits that he made mistakes during the campaign. He mentions the connection in t.i. the left bloc with Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković and his emotional responses to confrontations in which, in his words, unlike others, he was confronted ""with some purely family matters"".
After today's government session, Erjavec said in a statement for the media that he was not satisfied with the result achieved in the elections and that he expected a better result. ""But I am pleased that we continue to be a parliamentary party,"" he added. He pointed out that DeSUS is still not the smallest parliamentary party.
According to him, the party was ""attacked from all sides, from left to right, during the campaign, and even the media were not the most friendly.""
Dissatisfied with DeSUS's election result, he will offer his resignation at Friday's meeting of the party's council, the highest body between the two congresses, even if the executive committee, which meets a few hours earlier, gives him a vote of confidence.
Tomaž Gantar is mentioned as a possible candidate for further leadership of the party
Regarding the atmosphere within the party before Friday, Erjavec replied that some were dissatisfied and expressed this publicly. Most of the accusations are about his connection with Janković. The decision to do so was made by the party's executive committee, but Erjavec emphasizes that the party's president is always the one who bears the greatest responsibility for the election result.
There will be a discussion on Friday about the mistakes made. It is not possible to predict what the majority opinion will be on Erjavec's resignation. One can only hear from the party that it is necessary to clarify what is to blame for the poor result in the elections and, of course, how much responsibility Erjavec bears in this.
Erjavec is convinced that the leader of the parliamentary group Franc Jurša supports him all the time. But that one of the party's vice presidents, Tomaž Gantar, is emerging as one of the possible candidates for further party leadership. He adds that it is a decision of the party's bodies, ""I have made my mandate available."" Gantar estimates that Erjavec made the right move by offering his resignation.
He did not want to guess about the outcome of tomorrow, but reminded that there is a very uncertain situation at the moment. ""We do not know whether there will be a government, what this government will be like, we may even have early elections again, and the party must be as prepared as possible for any situation,"" he stressed. He pointed out the possibility that the party would be in opposition for the next four years and reiterated that only participation in the center-left government was possible for them.
Gantar would temporarily take over the leadership of the party
Gantar, who agreed to temporarily take over the leadership of the party until the congress in case of no confidence in Erjavec, said that he sees DeSUS in the left-wing coalition. But at the same time, he added that he thinks it is fair that they are also talking to someone who won the election. ""During the campaign and even now, there were too many purely personal grievances, exclusions and the like. I think that politicians at the highest level should not allow this and that we should talk to arguments,"" he said.
Gantar admits that it would be more difficult to coordinate with the SDS, but Erjavec is convinced that this is not possible at all, as they are too different when it comes to privatization and the sale of state property. ""We are incompatible,"" he said, reiterating that he did not want a third government experience with Janez Janša.
Erjavec reminded that the party's leadership, including Gantar, had decided to do so before the elections, and above all that they had told voters in the campaign that they would not participate in the coalition with the SDS. Therefore, changing this position is ""not an option"" for him.
Taking over the leadership of DeSUS would 'ruin Gantar's plans'
Gantar stressed today the importance of party unity, even when it comes to its leadership. He said that any solution was acceptable to him, so that only the party would agree on it. Asked whether, in his opinion, it would be better for the party to change the leadership, he answered that it is difficult to say. ""Ultimately, all of us, as well as probably most of the public, after so many years of leadership, equate DeSUS with Karl Erjavec,"" he said, adding that there was a certain fear of what would have happened if Erjavec had not been there. ""On the other hand, it is true that if Erjavec himself has actually lost more trust, then this means even greater problems for DeSUS in the final phase,"" he added.
Asked about the possible takeover of DeSUS, Gantar added that this would ""ruin his plans"", which is why he did not go to the parliamentary elections, as he intends to run for mayor of Piran in the fall."

The report will also be published in Friday's Official Gazette.
However, the results of the elections are to be challenged by representatives of some non-parliamentary parties affiliated to the Committee for Democracy of Equal Opportunities. They believe that the recent elections were unfair and illegal, as non-parliamentary parties were discriminated against. After today's session of the DVK, the representatives of the parties announced that they intend to challenge the results in the Supreme Court, and they will also appeal to the National Assembly, which is also enabled by the Parliamentary Elections Act. The appeal must be lodged no later than the first session of the mandate-election commission, at which they decide on the confirmation of parliamentary mandates.
The representative of the Sloga party, Janko Veber, announced that in the event of the rejection of the appeal, the confirmation of the mandates will also be challenged in the Constitutional Court. They are convinced that the inaugural session of the National Assembly cannot be held until the decision of the Supreme Court.
The official results of the elections held on June 3 show that nine parties have entered the National Assembly, while the relative winner is the SDS party.

They are followed by the Left with nine deputies and the NSi with seven deputies. Alenka Bratušek's Party and DeSUS will occupy five seats each in the new convocation of the National Assembly; the former was supported by 5.11 percent and the latter by 4.93 percent. The SNS, which will have four deputies, has re-entered the National Assembly.
The remaining 16 parties that ran in the elections did not enter the National Assembly. However, four parties that convinced more than one percent of voters in the elections will be eligible for co-financing from the state budget: SLS, the Pirate Party of Slovenia, Dobra država and Andrej Čuš and the Greens of Slovenia."

Some accuse him of overtaking, as Janez Janša must be the first to get the opportunity to form a coalition as president in the election of the victorious SDS. However, Šarec has already replied that he has no problem with this, that he is only checking whether the parties that refused to cooperate with the SDS before the elections still remain in this position.
SMC on the post-election situation
Cerar, after today's meeting of the party's executive committee, said that the SMC sees itself in a coalition of parties advocating an open, free-thinking and development-oriented society, which Marjan Šarec, the president of the second-ranked LMŠ, wants to form. ""If he manages to form a stable coalition, we will be part of that coalition,"" he added.
He also said in a statement for the media after the session at which the party's post-election intentions were discussed that the SMC also wanted such a coalition to achieve the party's program goals and to continue the good results of the current SMC-led government.
Cerar emphasized today that the SMC has always been a party that knew how to talk and did not refuse constructive talks. But if there was a conversation with the SDS president, Cerar would explain to him the position he had already represented in the election campaign, when he repeatedly stated that he did not want to cooperate with Janša's SDS, he said.
The SMC president rejected allegations of disputes within the party, especially between Cerar and Milan Brglez. ""Since the SMC has existed, it wants to show that there are divisions in our country. There is no such thing in the SMC. We are a free-thinking party, we have different opinions, which we then coordinate and act united,"" he was determined.
Asked whether he would prefer to see the Left or the NSi in the coalition, the SMC leader replied that it was too early to talk about what the new coalition would look like. He pointed out that those who have the responsibility to form a coalition must do their job. “In doing so, SMC will constructively cooperate and represent its program,” he added. According to him, this process will not be easy, but it must end for the good of Slovenia.
According to him, it is still too early to ""take any position"" on the candidate for President of the National Assembly. He announced that intensive talks on this would begin next week before the constitutive session of the National Assembly."

Before the vote on 'late coffee', they met with the president of LMŠ Marjan Šarc, where they found some common program points. Tonin acknowledged that the NSi would be ‘a little special’ in the center-left coalition.","The session of the NSi council ended, at which they decided on the offered resignation of the NSi president Matej Tonin. Tonin remains at the helm of the party after the party's vote. Tonin's stay in office was supported by 51 members of the party council, and nine would accept his resignation, which he offered because the party did not achieve the desired 10% support in the last parliamentary elections. However, it improved the election result from four years ago.
Ljudmila Novak also expressed her support for him
After the secret ballot, Tonin expressed satisfaction with the support. He assessed that today the party has decided to continue with the outlined direction and that they are trying to achieve even better results in the next elections than this time, when they improved the election result from four years ago. It is essential that the party remains united, he added. According to him, his predecessor Ljudmila Novak also expressed his support in the discussion.
Talks on the future coalition were also discussed at the party council. Tonin reiterated that the party is talking to both Marjan Šarc and Janez Janša, with whom he spoke twice after the election. He pointed out that the coordination of programs will be important.
Tonin: NSi would be ""a little special"" in the center-left coalition
At the meeting, Tonin presented Šarc with the NSi program and suggested that he review it and ""delete what is unacceptable to them"". Among the conditions for joining the coalition on the NSi side remain the elimination of waiting times in health care, an increase in net wages in the public and private sectors and the acceleration of procedures for the confiscation of illegally acquired property.
Tonin acknowledged that the NSi would be ""a little special"" in the center-left coalition. Therefore, they need feedback on how much other customers are willing to approach them. If the first verification of the programs shows that convergence is possible, they will go to the work of the program group by departments.
Regarding their conversation, Marjan Šarec explained that he ""responded too late to the invitation to the coffee that was already in February"". At that time, Tonin invited representatives of several parties for coffee, but Šarec announced that they would respond to the invitation when the time came. ""Now the time has come and we drank that late coffee,"" said Šarec, and did not want to reveal the content of the conversations.
They will continue to talk
He explained that they discussed many things, including some Kamnik topics, as the parties in the local municipal council are in a coalition. According to Šarc, the election programs of both parties were also on the table. But Šarec emphasized that it was too early to reveal any program points.
As for whether the NSi agrees with the starting points he sent to the elected parties with the exception of the SDS, Šarec said that they were such that it would not make sense to talk to those who had anything against them. forward.
""We heard from Nova Slovenija that we will continue to talk - this is what the meeting brought,"" said Šarec. NSi is ready to talk further.
Tonin believes that it would be wise to have at least the outlines of a potential coalition until the inaugural session of the National Assembly. would be surprising. He added that some underestimated program coordination.
Šarec: Maybe everything is not explicitly impossible
Asked whether NSi is a tab on the scales of a possible center-left government, Šarec replied that they could not say who the tab on the scales was because they had not yet conducted all the talks.
In recent days, Šarec has already met with the presidents of some other parties elected to parliament, Miro Cerar (SMC), Alenka Bratušek (Alenka Bratušek's party), Dejan Židan (SD) and Karel Erjavec (DeSUS). He did not agree on a date with the representatives of the Left and the SNS, he explained.
He also denied that they would talk to anyone about personnel issues. As he explained, it is first necessary to coordinate whether they will cooperate at all and how they will coordinate the programs. At the same time, he asserted that their party would not submit a proposal for a candidate for parliamentary speaker before the inaugural session of the National Assembly, which is expected to take place at the end of next week. ""I think it is right that we are constructive here. But I believe that by then we will have agreed on who this president will be,"" he added.
He said that he had not yet received an invitation from the SDS to a meeting, and said that he did not know if he could expect it. ""If they get it, they will decide whether to respond to it as well,"" he said, adding: ""Maybe anything is not explicitly impossible."""

The outgoing Minister of Economy Zdravko Počivalšek rejects the logic of excluding any prime minister, including the SDS leader. For the left wing of the SMC, the association with Janša is completely unacceptable, unofficially, in the extreme case, there is even a possibility of disintegration of the ten-member parliamentary group.","D-Day for the SMC will be tomorrow afternoon, when the wider leadership will meet for the first time after the elections and check the new relations and blood picture of the party after losing 26 seats compared to the previous elections.
There will also be a debate on the table as to where the party leader Miro Cerar should lead the coalition negotiations - right to Janez Janša, left to Marjan Šarc, or leave the door open for both.
But the interests of the party could not be more different. Minister and newly elected MP Zdravko Počivalšek strongly rejects the tactic of pre-determining names and wants substantive talks with anyone first.
On the other hand, the left wing of the SMC does not even want to hear about the talks with Janša's SDS. Milan Brglez even announces that as long as he is the vice-president of the right-wing coalition, he will not be. Meanwhile, Cerar's circle expects a ""pragmatic and state-building"" decision tomorrow and the start of negotiations with two potential prime ministers, Janša and Šarc, which would raise the political price of joining any party with only 10 deputies, without which neither the left nor the right government."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/dvk-potrdila-neveljavnost-81-glasovnic-z-volisca-v-buenos-airesu.html,Following the final election results: some candidates promised parliamentary seats left empty-handed,"The National Electoral Commission has announced the final election results, which remain unchanged in relations between the parties. However, some candidates who were promised a parliamentary seat were left empty-handed. At the request of the SDS, the DVK also inspected 81 invalid ballots from the polling station at the diplomatic and consular mission in Buenos Aires and found that all 81 ballots were in fact invalid.","At 12 noon, the final results of the early parliamentary elections were published on the DVK website, as all ballot papers sent by post from abroad were added. These did not affect the percentages received by individual customers.
The SDS received the most votes from abroad (1,387 votes), followed by the Left (756 votes), SD (719 votes), SMC (647 votes), LMŠ (518 votes), Nova Slovenija (488 votes), DeSUS (444 votes) , Alenka Bratušek's party (210 votes) and SNS (187 votes).
However, the SDS received 222,042 total votes (both cast at home and abroad), the Marjan Šarc List 112,250 votes, the Social Democrats 88,524 votes, the SMC 86,868 votes, the Left 83,108, Nova Slovenija 63,792 votes, Alenka Bratušek's party 45,492, DeSUS 43,889 votes and Slovenska national party 37,182 votes.
Shuffled cards within parliamentary groups
However, votes by mail from abroad shuffled the cards in the parliamentary groups of the Left, Alenka Bratušek's party and NSi. According to the counted ballot papers by post from abroad, some of the candidates who were promised a parliamentary seat were left empty-handed.
While Petar Dirnbek from Brežice initially promised himself a parliamentary seat in the Novo mesto constituency, Primož Siter from Trbovlje obviously gathered more votes among the Left's candidates in this constituency.
Martin Mikolič, the mayor of Rogatec, will not be among the NSi deputies in the next term, but Aleksander Reberšek from Žalec has joined the National Assembly.
There are also changes among Alenka Bratušek's party deputies, while party president Alenka Bratušek still remains outside parliament. Andrej Rajh from Maribor will take the place of Jožef Ribič, who was promised a parliamentary seat by post from abroad.
The results are not yet official, as they have to be confirmed by the DVK. It will do so at Thursday's session, and on Friday the report will be handed over to President Borut Pahor.
The DVK dispelled the SDS's doubts: 81 ballots from the Buenos Aires polling station are invalid
Namely, the SDS party filed an objection to the DVK due to irregularities in the work of the polling station in Argentina. It drew attention to the disproportionate number of invalid ballots at this polling station. In Argentina, 759 voters voted either in person or by mail, with 81 and 11 percent of invalid ballots cast, respectively.


According to the SDS, such a large number of invalid ballots casts doubt on the correctness of the work of the electoral committee and, consequently, on the fairness and credibility of the overall election results. Therefore, they suggested that all invalid ballots be reviewed, and in case of significant violations, all ballots from the polling station would be counted first, and they even suggested re-determining the result at all 31 diplomatic and consular missions.
After a long discussion, the DVK members decided to recount the 81 ballots. They did so and found that in fact they were all invalid and the electoral committee correctly determined the outcome of the election.
It turned out that the voters who cast an invalid ballot did not follow the instructions to fill in the official blank ballot. These were received by voters in countries outside Europe, and had to be completed by entering either the name of the party or the name and surname of the candidate in a blank box.
However, they could only vote for a candidate who ran in their constituency in Slovenia. In controversial cases, however, voters entered the name of a candidate who did not run in the election in their district, so these ballots were invalid. Most of these voters entered the names of the SDS and NSi champions, Janez Janša and Matej Tonin."
