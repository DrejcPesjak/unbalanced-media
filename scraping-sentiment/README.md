Archived part of the repository.

Here we use selenium to scrape web articles from specified news sites and then TextBlob sentiment to determine with which political party the news outlets sympathizes the most.

Currently this part of the repository is just a code dump.
The program uses selenium for scrapping web articles, thus you need to add geckodriver to path.

```console
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/repository/unbalanced-media/
