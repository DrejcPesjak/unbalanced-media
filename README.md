# Analysis of unbalanced Slovenian media news outlets - left vs right wing

Sentiment analysis of political news articles to determine whether a certain media is leaning left or right (if it writes more positively about political parties on left or the right).

Currently the repository is just a code dump.
The program uses selenium for scrapping web articles, thus you need to add geckodriver to path.

```console
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/repository/unbalanced-media/
```
