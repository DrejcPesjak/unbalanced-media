https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kadrovanje.html,"Governments go, cadres stay","The endless drive carousel is particularly marked before and after the elections. This is the time when every previous government has taken care of the employment of more or less loyal employees in state subsystems, who will remain in positions even after the replacement of ministerial positions. Numerous tenders from ministries have been published in the last month, as well as the appointment of new ambassadors and some other changes. During the term of the outgoing government, the opposition persistently pointed out the high intensity of this practice, and the LMŠ even calculated that the Janša government would even carry out two staff changes a day on average.","The outgoing government of Janez Janša was marked by numerous personnel changes, led by turmoil in the police, energy, culture, hospitals, education and other subsystems.
As colleagues from the Facts editorial office found, an additional 10,000 people have been employed in the public sector in the last term, ie since the 2018 elections. During the government of Marjan Šarc, the number increased by 4,600, and during the Janša government by more than 5,400. for the implementation of public procurement in the field of real property.
In the second half of April, the ministries announced 30 new posts, most of them at the Ministry of the Environment - 12. In addition, posts were advertised to the Surveying and Mapping Authority, the Environmental Agency and the Water Directorate. Recently, there have been changes in the supervisory board of Mladinska knjiga, where Jože Možina and former trainee Francija Matoza, Janša's lawyer, have taken over. For some, the appointment of Tomaž Kokot to the top of Pošta Slovenije was also controversial, as he does not have the required experience. The Management Board of SSH will carry out an independent legal review of the procedures and determine whether the procedures were carried out professionally and in accordance with the company's legislation and internal acts.
With the departure of the government, a number of ambassadors are ending their four-year term. Among the candidates for future heads of missions of the Republic of Slovenia abroad, which have already been approved by the National Assembly, the opposition also accuses some of inexperience and unprofessionalism. The government has recalled eight ambassadors, with nine running out this year.
In the first calendar year, the third Janša government made 1,117 appointments and 395 dismissals, and the rotation of the personnel counter continued through last year and this year. Tatjana Bobnar, Director General of the Police, Alenka Ermenc, Chief of the General Staff of the Slovenian Army, Dejan Matijevič, Director General of the Intelligence and Security Service (OVS) of the Ministry of Defense, and Kristina Plavšak Krajnc, Director of the Government Communication Office (Ukom), Rado Fele were dismissed. , Director of the Government Legislation Service. Anton Zakrajšek lost his position as director of the Commodity Reserves Institute.
Changes have also taken place in the energy sector. Supervisors of Gen energija first dismissed their long-time first husband Martin Novšak, and then appointed former state secretary at the Ministry of Infrastructure Blaž Košorok to the position of director general of the second pillar of Slovenian energy. Boris Sovič (Elektro Maribor) and Andrej Ribič (Elektro Ljubljana) also lost their staff in the energy sector. Despite good business results, the Gen-i did not extend the mandate of Robert Golob. All three are convinced that the government's moves were politically motivated.
Instead of Sandi Viršek, Petra Grajžl, Minister Vizjak's right-hand man, rose to the top of the Radioactive Waste Agency. There are also allegations of a lack of experience with her appointment. The government has transferred responsibilities for supervising the agency's operations to the Ministry of the Environment, with the desire to manage an estimated € 200 million estimated infrastructure project for the construction of a low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste repository in the background.
Personnel changes also took place in Telekom, Luka Koper, SDH, BAMC and Intereuropa. The opposition emphasized that they were either members or well-known supporters of the SDS party. At the same time, in their opinion, only a few meet the basic conditions for taking over leading positions.
During the epidemic, Janša's government was followed by numerous changes in health care, including the NIJZ, where Milan Krek took over the leadership after the resignation of Nina Pirnat and the temporary leadership of Ivan Eržen. The opposition also accused the latter of links with the ruling party, which Krek repeatedly denied and insisted in an interview with 24ur.com that politics did not interfere in the work of the National Institute of Public Health.
Changes also took place in the field of education. The government dismissed four members of the ARRS board - Jano Kolar, Emilija Stojmenova Duh, Justina Erčulj and Tone Kregar. Their place was taken by Igor Emri, Gabrijela Horvat, Fidel Krupić and Tina Tomažič. d. the director of the agency was confirmed by the government as Mitja Lainščak. Dismissed members of the Public Agency for Research of the Republic of Slovenia filed a lawsuit with the Administrative Court. In November 2020, the government dismissed Renato Zamida from the position of director of the Public Agency for Books, and appointed Dimitrij Rupel in her place. Recently, the government's decision to appoint dr. Borut Roncevic, State Secretary under the previous SDS government."

According to the new media freedom index, Slovenia achieved the worst ranking so far. They reminded of the events with STA and emphasized that RTV Slovenia is currently under attack due to political subordination. Among the first tasks of the future government coalition, the leaders of the Svoboda, SD and Levica parties point out the regulation of the situation in the media field and ensuring the independence of the media. To this end, in their opinion, the law on RTV and the media should be amended in an urgent procedure, they emphasized on the sidelines of the first official round of coalition negotiations.","The president of the Svoboda Movement, Robert Golob, the president of the SD, Tanja Fajon, and the coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, agree that regulating the situation in the media is one of the priorities of the future government. As Mesec said on the sidelines of the first official round of coalition negotiations, the media law was already discussed today as one of the first to be changed, and solutions to changes to the RTV law are ready.
""We will have to make a lot of efforts to ensure the independence of the media again,"" said Tanja Fajon. According to her, they have already prepared solutions to the amendments to the RTV Act, and they are also in favor of amendments to the Act, which would remove the policy from the RTV governing bodies.
The champions of all three parties also responded to the fall in the media freedom index, in which Slovenia slipped to 54th place. According to Robert Golob, Slovenia's slippage is another indication that it is high time for a change of government and ""one of the easier goals that we will improve. We will have to do it quickly,"" he announced. Moon and Fajon also pointed to the current government.
""The slippage of media freedom on Media Freedom Day is very worrying news and further proof of how much damage the outgoing government has done. It is not only a slippage in the media and democracy, but also a deep slippage against autocracy,"" she said. .
The president of the LMŠ parliamentary group, Brane Golubovič, also attributes Slovenia's slip in the media freedom index to the autocratic rule of this government. ""One of the characteristics of autocratic rule is the subordination of all media, and when you subjugate all media, when you want them to spread only one truth and that is the truth of the government, you fall on the scale of media freedom,"" Golubovic said.
The Legal Network for the Protection of Democracy submits proposals for resolving the public RTVS for public discussion
On today's World Press Freedom Day, the Legal Network for the Protection of Democracy presented the starting points for changes to the Radio and Television of Slovenia (RTVS) Act in the part relating to management and governing and supervisory bodies. In the next two weeks, they want to hold a public debate on them in order to reach the widest possible consensus.
""We believe that a functioning and high-quality public service is a precondition for a healthy democracy. At the same time, we note that the public service faces many challenges from digitalisation and commercialization of the media environment. ""said Barbara Rajgelj. She explained that with the amendments to the RTV Act they want to ensure the normalization and stabilization of the environment, which will enable quality production of content, and at the same time soften matters, which will allow the institute to start long-term reflection on the future of public service.
She pointed out that various stakeholders had been discussed at the Legal Network. ""First with media experts, then with employees, and partly with the public,"" she explained, adding that they do not think they have addressed all stakeholders so far, as there are many of them. In the next two weeks, they will therefore organize a public debate to which they will invite the general public.
The Voice of the People initiative also participated in the preparation of the solutions, said Sandra Bašić Hrvatin. Even before the parliamentary elections, the initiative warned that the independence of the RTVS program and supervisory board must be ensured immediately. In their opinion, it is necessary to ensure that the composition of both councils in the future will ensure the professionalism and independence of the operation of RTVS.
At their call, all forms and attempts at political control, reduction and silencing of the public media and political interference in the appointment of leading management and control bodies must be stopped. According to them, a legal change is needed to ensure the long-term independence of the public media from political parties.
The proposal includes changes in the area of ​​the Program and Supervisory Board and the Director General
Anuška Podvršič presented some starting points that she believes are important for changing the RTV Act. As she explained, the changes are mainly related to the work that regulates the program council, the supervisory board and the general director. According to them, it would make sense to reduce the number of members in the program council.
“Above all, we are talking about members appointed by the National Assembly and thus give more power in deciding who will sit in the council to employees and the public,” she said. Thus, they believe that it is enough that there are only two members in the world, appointed by political parties - one coalition, the other opposition. As before, one member would be appointed by the Hungarian and Italian minorities, and another would be appointed by the President on the basis of a proposal from the religious communities.
A larger number of members in the council would be appointed by employees. “We would do that in direct elections like we have done so far,” she said. Employee representatives would represent various activities, such as journalism, cultural arts and cultural activities.
A larger number of members in the council would also be appointed by the public. ""This appointment would not be centralized as before, where a larger number of members are elected by the National Assembly, but would be appointed by various institutions,"" she said, listing representatives of culture, science, sports, human rights ... case On the basis of a public tender, the Ombudsman appointed a representative to represent human rights.
According to them, the council should also have significantly more powers than before. ""The council would no longer be called the program council, as it would no longer only deal with a program policy, but would also get a supervisory function over operations. The supervisory board would no longer be needed,"" she explained. She added that a finance committee would be formed within the council, with a majority of finance experts.
They also believe that RTV should be represented by the management. ""The board would have its own president and more members. The board would thus take over the structure and function of the director general together with the professional directors, but everything would be regulated in law,"" she said. According to her, this would make the administration more stable and transparent.
Marko Milosavljevič from the Faculty of Social Sciences in Ljubljana said that they are aware that public RTV is very important for democracy, which was shown during the covid-19 epidemic. ""If we want to have a strong RTV, it must also be properly managed,"" he stressed. He must also be provided with strong funding, he added.
Regarding the Multimedia Center (MMC) of RTVS, Rajgljeva said that they wanted both Radio Slovenia and Television Slovenia to play their part in appointing the editor-in-chief of this editorial board, as was the case before the changes this year. The organizational area is so damaged that it needs to be fixed, she pointed out.
DNS: The situation for journalism in Slovenia is bad
On the occasion of the International Press Freedom Day, the Slovenian Journalists' Association (DNS) congratulated the journalists who, despite the increasingly hostile environment in which they have been working in recent years, have maintained high professional standards, quality and independence. ""Freedom of the media and journalists is key to the democratic political process, as evidenced by a look at the neighborhood, where subordination of the media has been one of the main tools for taking over and staying in power,"" they said in a press release.
They emphasized that the situation for journalism in Slovenia was bad and added that this was also shown by the new index of media freedom around the world, which ranked Slovenia 54th. ""This is the worst ranking since Reporters Without Borders has compiled the index,"" they wrote. Since last year, Slovenian media freedom has slipped 18 places and fallen into the category of ""problematic"" countries.
DNS points out that traditional media are finding it increasingly difficult to fund content that is not just a lure for clicks. ""Politics, especially the current one, wanted to be loyal to journalists as political propagandists, and discredited those who did not want to participate in all possible ways. It is not pleasant to be a journalist in such an environment.""
The DNS management of RTV, which does not enjoy the trust of the workers, called for resignation
On May 3 last year, the association launched a fundraising campaign for the Slovenian Press Agency (STA), ""in which the public has made it clear that it demands independent public media"". Today, they will gather in front of RTV Slovenia with other journalist organizations. ""When the government found out that the STA would not give up, and exhausted everything under pressure, including illegal possibilities, its attention shifted to RTV Slovenia,"" they say.
""We monitored a number of maneuvers, including circumventing the law, with which the management first beheaded the editorial board and then recruited staff who did not receive editorial support,"" they warn, explaining that the latest in a series of moves was their interests, enforcing changes to the statute of the public institution without a serious public discussion with the creators of the program, whose editorial boards are being separated by the proposal. ""In the Association of Journalists, we have repeatedly called on the management, which does not enjoy the trust of workers, to resign due to irregularities. We are repeating this call today,"" they said.
""Although the Association of Journalists is not in favor of unsystematic interventions in media legislation that need thorough overhaul, the depoliticization of RTV Slovenia will require rapid intervention to stop the decline in trust, professional standards and enable the public media to function normally. We expect discussion and constructive dialogue. ""they point out.
DNS with projects for local media and photojournalists
In its report, DNS also wanted to inform the public that at the end of the Local Media for a Better Society project, which was carried out together with journalists and local media from the region, they published an analysis of content monitoring and interviews with regional media editors. . ""On the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, we must not forget this important part of the media landscape, which brings local news and stories to the Slovenian public,"" they wrote.
The second project they are launching today relates to the position of photojournalists who have recently set up their own assets within the association. ""The profession of photojournalist is disappearing, photo editors are disappearing, and the price of work is constantly falling. To find out the conditions in which they work and how their work is evaluated, we published an extensive online questionnaire today. it also contained all the hidden costs of this profession, ""they wrote, inviting photojournalists to participate.
In conclusion, they added that they hope to work on the reform of media legislation by next May 3, the real goal of which will be to create a systemic framework for the successful operation of the media in Slovenia and to form a long-term media policy. ""For this, we need competent leadership and a team in the media directorate. These are moves that politics has announced. In the journalists' association, we will keep their word,"" they said.
RSF: Slovenia dropped 18 places on the media freedom index
Slovenia dropped 18 places on the index of media freedom and ranked 54th out of 180 countries, according to the index of the organization Reporters Without Borders. In the annual report, he warns against a new period of polarization, which is further intensified by information chaos.
The hostile atmosphere towards journalists, encouraged by Prime Minister Janez Janša, has led to physical and online attacks, the RSF report states. Although the legal framework protecting freedom of the press is still strong, the media is subject to political pressure and strategic SLAPP lawsuits.
Although the publicly owned media in Slovenia have been subjected to political pressure in the past, it has intensified since Prime Minister Janša returned to power in 2020, the report states. He adds that Janša usually insults journalists, whom he thinks are too critical.
The RSF also points out in the report that the government has arbitrarily stopped the financing of the Slovenian Press Agency for several months and appointed political allies to the management of RTV Slovenia and supervisory bodies. In addition, media outlets controlled by those close to Prime Minister Janša's SDS party are receiving investments from Hungarian oligarchs loyal to Viktor Orban. However, the lack of transparency in media ownership and the legacy of poorly regulated privatization threaten the independence of some media organizations, the report warns.
Journalists investigating corruption or pandemic management have received online harassment from supporters of the Prime Minister, especially female journalists. During the covida-19 pandemic, government-critical journalists warned of discrimination in access to public information. On the other hand, citizens showed solidarity with journalists and contributed en masse to the STA crowdfunding initiative after the government stopped funding it, the report said.
""The creation of media weapons in authoritarian states deprives citizens of their right to information, and at the same time is associated with growing tensions in the international community, which can lead to the worst wars,"" said RSF Secretary General Christophe Deloire.
Last year, the RSF noted that media polarization in countries further strengthens divisions within countries and polarization between countries at the international level. Within democratic societies, divisions are on the rise as a result of the spread of opinion media and misinformation reinforced by social networks, the report added.
This process is visible, among other things, in the case of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, as the propaganda war was already raging before the physical conflict, the RSF explains. China, for example, is using its legislation to restrict the population's access to other parts of the world and information.
Polarization is also present within democratic societies, among others in the United States. Social networks and opinion media in France are also contributing to increased social and political tensions. In Poland, however, the repression of independent media and the growing influence of the authorities on the public media have contributed to polarization.
The Annual Report of Reporters Without Borders on the Media Freedom Index topped Norway (1st), Denmark (2nd) and Sweden (3rd), where they follow a democratic model by promoting freedom of expression. However, the situation was described as very bad in a record 28 countries, including Belarus (153rd) and Russia (155th). At the tail end of the index are Iran (178th), Eritrea (179th) and North Korea (180th).
This year, Slovenia fell by 18 places to 54th place. Last year, when it fell four places in terms of the media freedom index, it ranked 36th. The situation is, on average, described as problematic. The situation is difficult in the field of economic context, in the field of political context it is assessed as problematic, and in the field of legislative framework, socio-cultural context and security as satisfactory.
Under the new methodology, the RSF defines media freedom as an effective opportunity for journalists to select, create and disseminate news and information in the public interest, independent of political, economic, legal and social interference and without compromising their security. The degree of media freedom is assessed in five categories: political context, legal framework, economic context, socio-cultural context and security.
Ombudsman: The authorities have a duty to provide an appropriate atmosphere for the free functioning of the media
On this day, the Ombudsman Peter Svetina also emphasizes the importance of free and independent media for the functioning of a democratic and plural society. He expects from the decision-makers appropriate measures with which Slovenia will advance on the scale of media freedom.
According to him, each authority is obliged to provide an appropriate atmosphere for the free operation of the media in their creation and dissemination of program content. ""I expect to establish an appropriate legal framework that enables both the free functioning of the media and the actual transparency of their ownership and the prohibition of spreading hate speech in the media. For many years we have been pointing out the need for amendments to the Media Act, which would also determine the way of protection of public interest, ""It is important that the damages awarded are high enough to deter the media from increasingly sensationalist and populist publications,"" Svetina said.
He is also concerned that defamation remains a crime, which poses a threat to media freedom, and therefore proposes the decriminalization of defamation. Journalists are often the target of online harassment, and there are more and more reports of strategic lawsuits against journalists. The Ombudsman expects the new government to address the necessary changes in media legislation as a matter of priority. He also believes that progress is needed on the transparency of the management of state and local community funds for advertising in media outlets. He also pointed out the inadmissible precarization of the journalistic profession.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/inspektor/konec-sveta-kot-ga-poznamo.html,The end of the world as we know it?,"The dramatic change on the Slovenian political stage will employ both politics and society for some time to come. Meanwhile, developments in Europe and the world, politically and economically, are moving forward. Also dramatic. And that will affect our future just as much as the party’s campaign promises.","Breaking down borders between cities along the border and new borders between countries. War, populism, extremism and darling. The European Union, built on the ruins, victims and suffering of the Second World War, seems to be weakening on the verge of slipping into another sea. Will we soon be in an energy and food crisis, will we be left without the rule of law, democracy and freedoms?
Legendary journalist and commentator on world events Ervin Hladnik Milharčič sees some possible directions for Europe. One is the path taken by Gorizia and Nova Gorica, ""on which two local communities, due to a combination of circumstances, no longer have any real meaning each"".
The second way is to predict the end of the world. ""Now we are at a time when the European order is changing. The old world is no more, but we have seen it many times,"" says Hladnik Milharčič.
Within this, Slovenia is not an island in itself and the future government will have to act in these circumstances. We will all feel the consequences of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the energy and food crisis is threatening us, and everyday life is already becoming more expensive. A comfortable life that will soon be threatened without dramatic social and economic changes is still self-evident to us. It is important for us to do our best - now.
This is also noticed by a middle-aged couple from Maribor, traffic engineer and local activist Josip Rotar and historian and anthropologist Mateja Ratej, a parent of two, active in their local environment. ""We each live in our own family circle, the highest sense is that our family prospers, we care less about everything else or we care too little that this could generate some social change,"" says Mateja Ratej.
Consumerism and digitalisation have further intensified individualisation in recent years. At home, we think and live in the short term, just for our family. More than a quarter of a million Slovenes (254,000) lived below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold in 2020 - one in eight Slovenes and 11,000 more than in the previous year (2019). The risk of social exclusion has increased even more.
At the same time, we also saw during epidemics the importance of domestic work, care for the elderly, protection, upbringing and education of children, which is still not included in gross domestic product and thus in economic growth. Only financial transactions count, says financial justice researcher Ajda Pistotnik.
And only on the basis of these indicators is the development of society measured. This is where this significant difference between the official performance of the state and the actual quality of life of individuals arises. We should really ask ourselves, but our way of life can still survive, warns Ajda Pistotnik.
In the meantime, we have been listening recently to how very successful our economy and economic growth are. However, it is necessary to be aware that this economic growth only counts products, product creation and product consumption, which means that we are increasingly consuming final resources and polluting the environment. This means that the more economic growth we have, the more we are developed according to all criteria, the faster we rush into a climate breakdown.
Increasing uncertainty, economic, existential, social and political, is being exploited by demagogues, populists and autocrats, who are also growing stronger in the countries of the European Union, and in some places increasingly in power. History teaches us that what they do all the time is dangerous, diminishing the independence of the judiciary and democracy, which includes, in addition to elections, the protection of human rights and freedoms. They are leading to the collapse of communities such as the European Union. And the key players are aware of that, says professor of international relations Ana Bojinović Fenko. Not only politicians and European bureaucrats, but also civil society movements and business people who know that in a political community such as the European Union, which is currently the most economically developed in the world, it offers the best quality of life and is most stable and means peaceful cooperation, even integration. countries, collective consideration must first come to the fore.
One of the best examples can be found on the western Slovenian border. The mayors of Gorizia and Nova Gorica have different political orientations, the Italian Rodolfo Ziberna is from Berlusconi's Forza Italie, the Slovenian Klemen Miklavič is from the left-wing movement. ""Together we see the same goals and also achieve the same goals through measures, which means that it is actually something that is accepted in the population as a whole and goes beyond political divisions and ideological views,"" says Miklavič.
It will be a big problem if even more European leaders, not just Viktor Orban, opt for illiberal instead of liberal democracy. Inwardly, Europe must look to its internal borders, nationalisms are still alive and well. And that threatens those day-to-day advantages of living in the Union - the free movement of people and goods and a common currency.
The outlook for society at the moment is anything but rosy, but not everything is as black as it seems at first glance. State and European institutions, bureaucracy and the like are just frameworks. In the end, it mostly depends on the people and the community how it works and how much it is willing to do."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/konec-ideologij-ali-zmaga-ene-ideologije.html,‘The end of ideologies’ or the victory of one ideology?,"After the end of the Second World War, and in the first years of the Cold War, American political science and sociological circles were dominated by dealing with ideology or. ideologies. One of the most pressing issues was the future of the world in the context of a clash of ideologies. The second broader discussion, however, concerned life at a time of “the end of ideologies” in the context of building a strong welfare state, with a strong working class and a regulated capitalist market.","Daniel Bell, a famous sociologist, published a book in 1960 entitled The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties. Bella’s key thesis is that the appeal of “total” ideologies that actually represent “secular religions” for Bella is diminishing due to the improvement of everyone’s standard of living. Total ideologies, he says, were sometimes a “path to action” as they addressed the anger, exploitation and exclusion of different parts of society. But, such ideologies in the conditions of a strong welfare state no longer have the same appeal and became in the 50s of the last century mainly ""dead ends"". The key question was no longer whether capitalism or socialism, as this contradiction was resolved by the creation of a welfare state. The issue of ideology and the conflict between ideologies therefore replaces the technical-managerial management of a society of abundance and a welfare state. In this context, Bell's book can be read as a specific eulogy to socialism, as one of the theses in the book is that socialism is becoming increasingly irrelevant and even harmful to the working class in the West in conditions of strong state prosperity and technological development.
Martin Seymour Lipset, one of the pioneers of political science in the United States, also took part in this discussion, taking similar positions in his books and articles as Bell. Lipset emphasized that his thesis on the end of ideologies is not a thesis on any decline in political debate, but rather on the end of ""total ideologies"" that strongly influenced the peoples of the world in the 19th and 20th centuries and were in stark contrast to other with another. The predominant form of political belief in the “West” was described by Lipset as “conservative socialism”, where the emphasis is on the market and on a strong welfare state. Both liberal, conservative, and Social Democratic or Socialist parties in North America and Western and Northern Europe believed in and advocated this.
Technological development, high economic growth, as well as the actual redistribution of wealth created by the working class have created the material conditions for discussions on the “end of ideologies”. However, in these two specific debates of Bell and Lipset (as well as to some extent in similar debates by C. W. Mills) it was a matter of defending the Social Democratic Third Way before it was ""invented"" as a new form of politics by English Labor during Tony Blair's rule. production for the market as the only possible and ""non-totalitarian"" and combining production for the market with a strong welfare state.
At the end of the Cold War, however, a new thesis emerged on the end of ideologies that was essentially, in a very mechanistic interpretation of Hegel’s philosophy, equated with the end of history. Francis Fukuyama, first in a famous article and later in The End of History and the Last Man, defended the following thesis: in the West there is a ""supra-ideological"" consensus on fundamental political and economic values, but also at the global level, after defeat socialism, there has been a supra-ideological political-economic order where all societies and states will be essentially based on liberal democracy and capitalism. What Fukuyama very noticeably omitted, compared to Bell and Lipset’s argument, was the emphasis on a strong welfare state.
This difference in understanding the end of ideologies is important and significant. During this period of 30 years - from the first major debate to the second major debate on the end of ideologies - tectonic shifts took place in politics, economics and society. Fukuyama was able to omit the emphasis on the welfare state without much difficulty, as in the period from the early 1980s, the disintegration and change of this in the ""West"" gradually began. The conditionality of social benefits has become the common sense of politicians of ""various"" supra-ideological parties, and the defeat of socialism has completely eliminated the fear of capital and the state of the possibility of workers' revolts. The state became more and more servile to capital, but it began to move to places where production costs were (were) lower and profit rates were therefore higher. All of this was framed by the neoliberal ideological-practical revolution - in the 1970s, first by coercion in Chile and later by the use of more ""peaceful"" means - although the showdown with the unions was bloody everywhere - based on the idea that the market and market relations must be extended to all spheres of life, the welfare state must be limited as much as possible, and the state must be limited to the role of ""night watchman"". Thus, Fukuyama's prediction of the end of history, or a reflection of the end of history and the end of ideologies, was essentially a reflection of the victory of the political-ideological project of neoliberalism, or. market and capitalism without the admixture of the welfare state.
Debates and desires for a world without ideologies - that is, without great narratives and disputes about them - do not mean that we actually live in a world without or beyond ideologies, but rather the victory or dominance of one ideology over another and the dominance of one mode of production over others. . This has been clear since the beginning of the debate on the “end of ideologies” in the 1950s. The spirit of the Cold War created an alternative to the ""supra-ideological"" world in the form of a powerful welfare state based on the capitalist mode of production, and after the end of the Cold War this utopia turned into a neoliberal dystopia embodying the most ""pure capitalism"" (Husson). A policy based on the “end of ideology” and on consensus is at its core an anti-political regulation of the status quo, without questioning the fundamental foundations of society. ""The end of ideologies"", either from the perspective of the Social Democratic Third Way or from the perspective of liberal / conservative neoliberals, means the victory of capitalism with a touch of cultural struggle."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/najvecji-rusofil-med-politiki-v-sloveniji-je-janez-jansa.html,'The greatest Russophile among politicians in Slovenia is Janez Janša',"He was considered indestructible, he held ministerial positions one after the other, such and other scandals stuck to him, he marked the last 20 years of Slovenian politics, as there was no government in which he did not participate. Both Janša and others. But in the end he did not want to join Janša's government anymore. At a time of constructive distrust, when he was a candidate for the new prime minister, he earned the inscription rat in the garden of the house. Erjavec is also accused of being a Russophile for seducing Slovenia too much into the embrace of Moscow as foreign minister. In the show Ena na ena, he told Uroš Slak that the biggest Russophile was Janez Janša and reminded him of the South Stream project, but he still believes that sending heavy weapons to Ukraine is not the right solution. He is convinced that diplomatic activities should be launched immediately instead: ""If tensions escalate, we will really experience even worse things. When Russians say something, they usually mean it,"" he said.","Karl Erjavec also made headlines in the Slovenian media because of his two daughters, Ines and Eva. What role did Eva Erjavec's ex-husband, businessman Andrej Marčič, play at the time? When they met, Erjavec first asked Marčič what it meant to be a businessman and to be politically active, but Marčič assured him that this was not important.
""Later, however, this turned into pressures that I have to join the Janša government,"" he said. It seems that he had a great interest in being in the government and would probably have better employment opportunities in this regard, Erjavec believes. “He kept pushing me to become a minister, that DeSUS had to stay in the coalition, she didn’t tell me right away, but it escalated when those pressures got too strong,” she describes how politics has also cut into her daughter’s family life.
Regarding the infamous photo of Marčič, Janez Janša and Božo Dimnik on the yacht, Erjavec says that it is clear that this was taken without the knowledge of the Prime Minister. ""Probably everyone who set foot on that yacht received secret photography and filming. Secret filming was also carried out when we were in his apartment. I didn't even know it until they told the police, where a procedure is underway,"" says Marčič's former father-in-law.
He no longer wanted to join Janša's government
When it was already clear that Erjavec would win the party congress at the end of 2020, he called him Jelko Kacin and ""somehow hinted that I was offered the position of Minister of the Interior"". However, Erjavec said that he could not break his promise not to take part in any of Janša's governments: ""Because I knew that his policy led to the creation of another Slovenia, another republic, as expressed in the SDS."" He reminded that in the 2018 elections he supported the idea of ​​the left bloc, because he was afraid that if Janša formed a government, ""what happened to us will happen to us"". He says there were already signs of ""orbanization"" at the time. As he says, we used to always strive for t. i. core Europe, and now our partners are Hungary and Poland.
At the beginning of 2021, there was a constructive distrust against the Janša government, Erjavec was a candidate for a new prime minister, but the distrust failed. ""At the time, the problem was the deputies, except for Jurij Lep, whom I congratulate. He was re-elected to the National Assembly in the Freedom Movement. While the others were not enthusiastic about leaving the government, obviously everyone had a certain interest,"" he said. Erjavec. In addition to Lep's vote, the KUL coalition provided him with 39 votes, which was still too few. He also talked to Igor Zorčič from the SMC, where they also expressed dissatisfaction with the work of Janša's government, but according to Erjavec, he estimated that it was a little too early to wait another two or three months. . ""At that moment, I also became a prisoner of some DeSUS MPs, who conditioned that they would support my mandate if I gave the assurance that part of the SMC party would also support me,"" he describes.
Who was the gravedigger of DeSUS?
Erjavec became a member of the DeSUS party a week before the start of the 2004 election campaign: ""Polls predict that DeSUS does not have the conditions to enter parliament. people, especially the elderly. That's how DeSUS came to the National Assembly for 200 votes at the time. "" Although Janez Janša, who won the election, even demanded that these votes be counted, DeSUS finally joined his government. Erjavec became party president a few months later. He set himself the goal that DeSUS would always be in parliament and not be the smallest party.
Then Erjavec was no more and after 26 years DeSUS is no longer in parliament. Who is the DeSUS Undertaker? ""Deputies and former president Aleksandra Pivec. If we came to parliament with a promise not to participate in the government of Janez Janša, then you cheated your constituents. given that she has experienced distrust after only a few months. ""
He says he did not take advantage of the party to always be a minister: ""If that were the case, he would be in Janša's government today."" Now that he is no longer in politics, he feels a lot of relief.
Janša as a Russophile and warned that Russia's threats should be taken seriously
Erjavec is also accused of being a Russophile for seducing Slovenia into the embrace of Moscow. ""The greatest Russophile among politicians in Slovenia is Janez Janša,"" he said. ""Who sold the Slovenian steel industry to the Russians in 2008? As is known, Andrej Vizjak carried out this project as a minister and operationally the wife of the then prominent SDS member, Dr. Zagožna. Let's go to 2012, the government was sworn in on February 10, On the 28th, he was already the President of the Gazprom Management Board in Ljubljana and they were already talking about implementing the South Stream project. A few weeks later, he came to Maribor and talks continued. , ""he listed a number of events, including the accounts with the Russian bank Sberbank.
According to him, a large number of his visits to Moscow accumulated because he was also the chairman of the interstate commission for economic cooperation during his ministry, which he became during the Janša government. The practice was to meet twice a year - once in Slovenia and once in Russia. In addition to 20 other projects, the main project of this commission was the South Stream gas pipeline project, says Erjavec.
He also met several times with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, what did he tell him about the goals of Russian foreign policy in Ukraine and elsewhere, before the Third World War? ""When the Russians express a threat, it's not like that, every threat must be taken seriously. Even when we talk about the use of nuclear weapons. If Russia is squeezed into a corner, that too can happen. Lavrov said there is a possibility of a third world ""The only solution is to start talks immediately. The fact that heavy weapons are being sent to Ukraine is not the right policy, because it will continue the conflict, and in the long run, Ukraine will only be a ruined country,"" he said. warned. ""I am not a Russophile, but I just say that it would be necessary to launch diplomatic activities as soon as possible. If tensions escalate, we will really suffer even worse things. When Russians say something, they usually think seriously,"" Erjavec said."

The White House said the conversation was very constructive.","""They talked mostly about migration and working together to coordinate measures to reduce migration,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said after talks between Joe Biden and Andres Manuel Lopzez Obrador. They also talked about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with Mexico not joining sanctions against Moscow, global economic challenges, the covida-19 pandemic, climate change and the fight against drug trafficking.
The United States will ban the entry of asylum seekers into the United States on May 23 due to the covida-19 pandemic, and Americans are preparing for the consequences of a new wave of migrants, both practically and politically. Biden is already having problems in opinion polls because of this issue, being attacked from both the right and left of the political spectrum. Republicans say it opens borders and Democrats say it doesn't do enough for migrants. Biden is usually looking for a middle ground.
The entry ban for migrants was imposed by Donald Trump in March 2020 due to the covida-19 pandemic. Since then, they have had to wait in Mexico for a solution to the US deposits. In Mexico, meanwhile, they are exposed to violence, robbery, rape and other violations, as the U.S.’s southern neighbor is unable to bear the burden.
The attack on migrants has paid off politically for Trump, who would not have been elected without it, and Bidn's policy is not decisive in either direction, which will not benefit Democrats in the November congressional election. U.S. border agents have apprehended an average of 7,800 migrants a day at the southern border in the past three weeks, five times the average in the 2014-2019 pre-pandemic outbreak."

It seems that for the first time in the history of Slovenia, the National Assembly will be led by a woman, namely the vice-president of the Svoboda Movement, Urška Klakočar Zupančič. She was initially a candidate for Minister of Justice, but now the Ministry of Justice is supposed to belong to the Social Democrats. The Ministry of the Interior could belong to Tatjana Bobnar, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Tanja Fajon.","After Tuesday's meeting between the president of the winning party, Robert Golob, and the president of the SD party, Tanja Fajon, plans have changed somewhat. It seems that former judge Urška Klakočar Zupančič will not take over the role of head of the Ministry of Justice, but will be the first woman in the history of independent Slovenia to take the chair of the National Assembly, the N1 portal was the first to report. According to our information, Klakočar has already accepted Zupančič's offer.
According to unwritten rules, the second highest political position in the country usually belongs to the second largest coalition partner, the SD, but because the Svoboda party won such a large number of seats in the National Assembly (41), a representative of their party will take the seat.
To be honored if the party president nominated her for the post, she told the portal, adding that the National Assembly would then decide on it. She will need an absolute majority in a secret ballot, which means 46 MP votes. Until the vote, the inaugural session will be chaired by the oldest member of the new convocation, Miroslav Gregorič (Svoboda Movement).
Since the first National Assembly, which was constituted in 1992, the legislative branch has been led by Herman Rigelnik, Jožef Školč, Janez Podobnik, Borut Pahor, Franc (Feri) Horvat, France Cukjati, Pavel Gantar, Ljubo Germič, Gregor Virant, Janko Veber, Milan Brglez, Matej Tonin, Dejan Židan and Igor Zorčič.
Klakočar Zupančič became known to the public in last year's affair, when politics demanded that she be sanctioned because she criticized the Prime Minister on her closed Facebook profile. Due to political pressure, she left the judiciary in protest.
""As you know, my critical words on Facebook were followed by a real pogrom. I found myself in disciplinary proceedings, I was also deprived of the position of head of the condominium department at the Ljubljana District Court,"" she said in an interview with 24UR at the end of January. although she was later found not guilty, she left the judiciary on her own. She was disappointed that ""the judiciary has succumbed to political pressure"".
She also said that she joined Robert Golob's team because she highly values ​​him as an expert and as a person. And because they share the same values.
Bobnar's interior ministry, Fajon's foreign ministry?
Klakočar Zupančič was initially one of the main candidates for Minister of Justice. On Thursday, Golob allowed the possibility of leaving justice to coalition partners, thus avoiding a possible conflict of interest due to the supporter of the Freedom Movement, Zoran Janković, 24UR reported.
The judiciary is now expected to fall into the SD quota, where Andreja Katič and Dominika Švarc Pipan are mentioned as candidates. None of them deny their interests. According to our unofficial information, the Ministry of the Interior is supposed to be promising Tatjana Bobnar, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is promising SD President Tanja Fajon. The Ministry of Health would belong to doctor Danijel Bešič Loredan. According to our information, Golob also wants to see cardiologist Mirta Koželj in the team in this department."

Not far away, in the Austrian capital, the city's housing policy is taking a completely different approach. Vienna is a city of tenants. As many as 60 percent of Viennese live in rented municipal and subsidized housing. Rent in these apartments is safe, there is no time limit, and rents are lower than in Ljubljana on the private market. The share of such housing represents almost half of the total housing market in Vienna.","Vienna is at the top of virtually all global quality of life rankings. Rightly, the tenant of the subsidized apartment Saša Obreht tells us: ""We have a swimming pool on the roof of the block, we have a sauna in the block, a fitness center, common areas that we can use, a lot of green areas."" But this is not some elite neighborhood with dizzying rental prices. But part of a Viennese housing model with a century-old tradition based on affordability and security for tenants. Lease contracts in subsidized and municipal housing have no time limit, and the amount of rent is limited and on average at least a third lower than private housing providers.
""Living with us is a fundamental right, it has been our political decision since time immemorial. We see our task as providing affordable, safe and quality housing for the people of Vienna,"" explains Kathrin Gaal, Deputy Mayor of Vienna. As many as 60 percent of Viennese live in rented apartments, and the waiting period for them is about a year to a year and a half. The quality of housing, they say, is the same or even higher than that of private individuals.
""The model is designed so that millions of euros are obtained on the basis of the housing tax, specifically for Vienna it means about 250 million a year, which we invest in subsidized housing. Thus, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000 subsidized apartments are built annually they are restored with subsidies, ”explains Christian Schantl. Almost half of the total housing market consists of municipal and subsidized housing. ""This is a relevant share, which also affects the fact that rents in the private market are not growing as much as in other European cities,"" he added.
Housing is not only intended for the socially weaker, but for a wide range of the population, as the income limit for housing is much higher than the average income. In Vienna, they say, it is not possible to determine how much someone earns by the address of their stay."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/drzavna-proslava-znova-razdvaja-slovensko-politiko.html,The national celebration again divided Slovenian politics,"The national celebration on the day of the uprising against the occupier once again divides Slovenian politics. Only the Prime Minister Janez Janša was present at the ceremony on Mala gora near Ribnica in the Dolenjska region, but the President of the Republic Pahor and the Speaker of the National Assembly Zorčič were not present.","A national celebration on the day of the uprising took place on Mala gora near Ribnica on Tuesday at the place where the Tigers clashed with the occupier in 1941. The national celebrations were attended by, among others, Prime Minister Janez Janša and Ribnica Mayor Samo Pogorelc. On this occasion, Janša laid a memorial wreath at the TIGR memorial.
Why is the choice of this location exciting?
The choice of this location - Mala gora above Ribnica - met with opposition and protest in the office of Presidents Pahor and Zorčič, as well as in veterans' organizations. As they say, the event on Mali gora does not represent the beginning or the integrity of the national liberation resistance of the Slovene nation during the national liberation struggle.
In his speech on Mali gora, DS President Alojz Kovšca pointed out the daily divisions and called for overcoming them, as our ancestors did, who knew how to ""find light in key stormy dark moments"". But ironically, this celebration, as it has been for many years so far the day before the day of the uprising against the occupier, once again deepened the rift and tensions in Slovene politics.
As in previous years, this year's celebration, as noted by the TIGR Primorska association for several years in a row, did not hear a single word about the special position of Primorska under fascist Italy, where the fire of rebellion burned on 13 July 1920 in Trieste. words were heard about the Liberation Front and its values, about the partisan liberation struggle in which the Tigers also took part.
As they have pointed out for several years in a row, it is not true that the conflict on Mali gora was the first clash with the occupier on Slovenian soil and that three tigers clashed with 34 Italian soldiers. According to the society, three tigers in Lovšinova koča on Mali gora were surprised on 13 May 1941 by an Italian patrol consisting of four Italian carabinieri and three local militiamen. These local militiamen were nothing more than domestic collaborators. ""So the event on Mali gora can rightly be considered the first armed attack by domestic collaborators on Slovenian rebels, this time the Tigers,"" they wrote.
Historian Tone Ferenc in his book Actions of the TIGR Organization in Austria and Italy in the Spring of 1940 also states that even before this collaborative armed action there was a betrayal when local farmers informed the carabinieri in Ribnica the presence of ""subversive elements"" on Mali gora. According to the association, the organizers of the celebration inadvertently admitted that domestic collaborators were an integral part of the Italian occupation units.
They also refer to the words of historian Božo Repet for Dnevnik, who said that there was no planned armed conflict on Mala gora, but that the Italian carabinieri received information that these people were there, so they wanted to arrest them. The historian added that the event on Mali gora is too mythologized, and the goal is obvious. We would like to replace the liberation front with something else. ""Mala gora is the most convenient because the events of that time involved tigers who are generally nationally acceptable, as opposed to communists who are not acceptable on the right,"" Repe explained.
That is why the TIGR Primorska Association has repeatedly pointed out that they are strongly protesting against new and new attempts to falsify half-past history, especially against falsifying history and lies at tiger monuments.
A good month ago, President Pahor even called for another location, but they were clearly not heard. And although he formally invited the state summit to the celebration, this time the President of the Republic Borut Pahor, who is currently on a working visit to Zagreb, is not among the guests of honor. As he explained today on the sidelines of the meeting with the president of the Freedom Movement, Robert Golob, he wanted to meet with Milanović before Thursday's visit of German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to Berlin. He emphasized that if the President of the Republic is in the country, he must attend the celebration. “I would be on this one too, even if it’s not convened exactly to my liking,” he added. Pahor does not agree with the choice of the location of the celebration, his office announced last week.
The President of the National Assembly, Igor Zorčič, canceled his participation in protest.
Let's remember
On 13 May 1941, Zelen, Majnik and Kravanja clashed with an Italian patrol on Mala gora near Ribnica, which for many is considered to be the first clash with the occupier in the Second World War on Slovenian soil. The leader Zelen was killed in the clash, Kravanja was wounded and captured, but later escaped, and Majnik escaped during the clash.
In his speech, DS President Alojz Kovšca pointed out the daily divisions and called for overcoming them, as our ancestors did, who knew how to ""find light in key stormy dark moments""."

Croatian President Zoran Milanovic, with whom Slovenian President Borut Pahor met on a working visit to Zagreb in the afternoon, also believes that relations have improved in the last two years.","At the invitation of Croatian President Zoran Milanović, President Borut Pahor paid a working visit to Zagreb in the afternoon. The two presidents consulted on current issues in the region and Europe. As co-leaders of the Brdo-Brijuni Process initiative, they also talked about convening the next meeting of the leaders of this initiative. They decided to suggest to the leaders that this meeting be held in Slovenia.
The two presidents also spoke at their meeting on May 10, 2022, to be held in Rijeka. This will be the 30th anniversary of the Association of Slovenian Societies in Croatia, and the trilaterals of Slovenia, Austria and Croatia, which will be organized by Croatia in June this year.
Plenković: It is difficult to say what the Slovenian-Croatian relations will be like in the future
The Croatian news agency Hina writes that the most likely new Slovenian Prime Minister, Robert Golob, will insist on the implementation of the arbitration award, and has also announced that he will pursue a different foreign policy than Janša. ""Based on one statement on election night, it is difficult to say what this policy will be,"" the Croatian prime minister said.
Before the elections in Slovenia, Andrej Plenković expressed his support for Prime Minister Janez Janša, with whom he is a member of the same European political family, the European People's Party. On Monday, he reiterated that he would do the same again, stressing that Janša is his friend and that relations between the two countries have greatly improved and relaxed.
He reminded that Slovenia had supported Croatia's entry into Schengen and the euro area and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). ""It would not be good if a change in the political configuration in Slovenia led to a change in political views,"" he said. At the same time, Plenković on Monday criticized the president of Croatia's largest opposition party, the Social Democrats (SDP) Peđa Grbina, saying he had ""grossly criticized and even insulted"" Janša.
Namely, Grbin said on Sunday that the ""corrupt autocratic policy of Janez Janša"" failed despite the support of the Croatian Prime Minister. Croatian President Milanovic also responded to the elections in Slovenia today. He will meet with Slovenian President Borut Pahor in Zagreb this afternoon.
He expressed the expectation that Golob would form a government quickly. ""This is their architecture. Slovenia has been structured in this way for 30 years. It is a liberal left, all this comes from the shirt of the Socialist Youth Union, unlike the Communist Union in Croatia,"" the Croatian president commented on Sunday's election.
Milanovic added that relations between Zagreb and Ljubljana have been ""really good"" for the last two years, and that Janša was responsible for this. ""We see that relations between Croatia and Slovenia are more stable when Janša is in power, but even when the left was in power, they were not hostile,"" he said.
Regarding the possibility that the new Slovenian government would try to prevent Croatia from joining Schengen, he said that Croatia would not be over in this case. ""If they look at their interests, they will demand that Croatia join Schengen, otherwise they will have to hire another 20,000 police officers,"" he added."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/preverjeno/vegan-aktivist-upornik.html,"Vegan, activist, rebel","In the show Preverjeno we reveal the situation in the Slovenian livestock industry. Following the pandemic, it is even clearer that it is essential to promote the production of sustainable agricultural products.","In 2020, a group of activists secretly documented the state of Slovenian intensive pig farming. They wanted to show the public what the standard is in the livestock industry in our country. They have set up the AETP, which is fighting for greater transparency regarding animal farms, explained spokesman Samo Curk. ""This is done with the help of hidden cameras or night visits by activists who give us these recordings, and we also ask people in the industry to contact us if they want to whistle, and we will publish it.""
There are many activists living in the country who have been raising awareness of animal rights for years. Matej Glivar is one of the most recognizable. He has enjoyed meat, eggs and milk for over 30 years. As he says, he was a prisoner of the system we all live in. ""I decided overnight. I tried first, but then I felt I didn't want to support animal violence anymore. I would never do it myself, but I go to the store and pay someone to do it for me and then I'm very I quickly started looking for ways to become active, but I was never an activist. ""
The goal of all actions is change. Through activism, they want to reach a wider circle of people and encourage critical thinking, and above all, force the public to talk about this topic.
Farmer Milan Rus from Prlekija is one of the few to publicly point out that he is vegan. We visited it in the village of Mota in the municipality of Ljutomer. On the Grunt family farm he used to have pigs, cattle, horses, now he produces exclusively organically grown cereals, porridge and oils. ""I got sober and I'm surprised that no one else has been affected by this. There are few of us who have thought about it. I had to switch, I had no choice but to let my conscience continue.""
Agricultural policy is linked to subsidies. Therefore, a kilo of meat can be even cheaper than a kilo of fruit. We all pay the difference in price with contributions and taxes. In Slovenia, we subsidize food of animal origin three times more than food of plant origin. For years, many organizations and societies have called on the government to shift agricultural subsidies from livestock farming to human plant production over the next ten years."

V novi sestavi parlamenta bo imela rekordnih 41 poslancev. Kaj bo stranka naredila, da ne bo razočarala volivcev, kot se je v preteklosti že dogajalo z novimi strankami, ki so prevzele vlado? Kot je v oddaji 24UR ZVEČER dejal Golob, je vsaka stranka drugačna in tudi Gibanje Svoboda je drugačno. 
""Ljudem smo vnaprej povedali, kaj je tisto, za kar se bomo zavzemali,"" je dejal. ""Odgovornost je velika in jo sprejemamo ponižno,"" je poudaril.
S strankama SD, ki je osvojila sedem mandatov, in Levico, ki bo imela pet poslancev, se že pogovarjajo o sestavljanju vlade. Uradni pogovori pa se bodo po Golobovih besedah začeli prihodnji teden. Poudaril je, da je časovnica dokaj znana, saj naj bi se parlament oblikoval do 13. maja. Želijo si, da bi koalicijo oblikovali čim prej, celo hitreje, kot jo je Lojze Peterle, ki je imel v parlamentu ministre potrjene v 34 dneh od volitev.
Kako na oblikovanje bodoče vladne koalicije vpliva ponujen odstop Mesca?
Čeprav je prvak Levice, Luka Mesec, zaradi slabšega rezultata na volitvah, svoji stranki ponudil svoj odstop, sta z Golobom že govorila o prihodnjem sodelovanju. ""Predstavil sem mu situacijo v naši stranki. Stvar glede mojega odstopa bo razrešena do konca tedna. Če dobim zaupnico, lahko s pogovori začnemo že v začetku drugega tedna,"" je dejal Mesec.
Kot je pojasnil, je svoj odstop svetu stranke ponudil zato, ker je timski igralec. ""To se mi zdi osnovna demokratična higiena. V življenju je bolj kot to, kako prenašaš zmage, pomembno tudi, kako preneseš poraz. Ali bodo od mene zahtevali odstop, bo odločil svet stranke,"" pravi. 
Tudi Tanja Fajon (SD) je dejala, da so se o slabšem rezultatu na volitvah že pogovorili znotraj stranke, ki ji je kljub temu zaupala mandat za koalicijska pogajanja. ""Za zdaj ostajam na čelu stranke in imam mandat za pogajanja,"" je dejala in poudarila, da se bodo o njeni nadaljnji usodi na čelu stranke odločali na volilnem kongresu stranke, ki bo čez šest mesecev.  
Kako si bodo razdelili ministrstva?
Golobova stranka ima med vsemi tremi strankami, ki se dogovarjajo za koalicijo, daleč največ mandatov in bi ji zato pripadlo tudi največ ministrstev. ""Pripada nam levji delež odgovornosti,"" je priznal Golob, a poudaril, da se bodo morali najprej potruditi, da ne bodo razočarali ljudi. Izpostavil je, da si želijo prevzeti odgovornost predvsem za zdravstveni in finančni resor ter področje podnebnih politik. 
""Zdravstveni minister potrebuje zaslombo predsednika vlade in finančnega ministra,"" je poudaril. Potrdil je, da na čelu zdravstvenega ministrstva vidijo Danijela Bešiča Loredana, ki je eden prvih zdravnikov, ki si je upal spregovoriti o korupciji v zdravstvu.
Mesec je sicer pred volitvami dejal, da je Loredan zanje nesprejemljiv. ""Tudi o tem sva z Golobom govorila. Dejal sem, da je nesprejemljiv glede na program, ki ga je predstavil,"" je pojasnil in dejal, da mu je Golob zagotovil, da bodo vladni program oblikovali skupaj. Kot je še dodal, pričakuje, da bodo rešitev za zdravstvo iskali v okviru javnega. ""Korupcija v zdravstvu ne sme biti izgovor za njegovo privatizacijo,"" je poudaril.
In katera ministrstva zanimajo SD? Fajonova ne skriva, da jo zanima mesto zunanje ministrice, a za ta položaj ima tudi Gibanje Svoboda svojo kandidatko Marto Kos. ""Pogovarjala se bom tako z Golobom kot znotraj vodstva stranke. Vse korake bomo sprejemali skupaj,"" je odgovorila in poudarila, da imajo v SD strokovno ekipo. Sicer pa je dejala, da si je tudi SD zastavila jasne prioritete, med katerimi so javno zdravstvo in šolstvo ter pomoč mladim pri reševanju stanovanjskega problema. 
Mesec pravi, da se o tem, katera ministrstva bi zasedla Levica, še niso pogovarjali. ""Nismo še tako daleč. Najprej moramo v stranki opraviti pogovore v tem tednu,"" je dejal in dodal, da so resorje, ki jih zanimajo, že omenili v programu.
Sicer pa je Golob poudaril, da je vse še odprto in da bo pri izbiri ministrskih kandidatov glavni kriterij strokovnost. ""Iskali bomo najbolj strokovne in najboljše kadre. Želimo združevati najboljše kadre, ne glede na strankarsko pripadnost,"" je poudaril.
Prepričan je, da jim bo uspelo v hitrem času sestaviti levosredinsko vlado. ""Vsebinska razhajanja so bistveno manjša, kot se zdi. Sem velik optimist, da lahko razhajanja, ki so minimalna, odpravimo v čim krajšem času,"" meni Golob. 
Kaj bodo prve poteze nove vlade?
Fajonova je spomnila na predvolilno obljubo SD, da si želijo okrepiti javno zdravstvo. Dejala je, da si želijo državnega sekretarja ali koordinatorja, ki bi skrbel samo za skrajševanje čakalnih vrst.
Vse stranke pa se strinjajo, da bo ena od prvih nalog, ki se jih bodo lotili, odprava škodljivih ukrepov, ki jih je Janševa vlada sprejemala v času zdravstvene epidemije. ""Podprli bi zakon, ki ga je predlagal Inštitut 8. marec glede ukinitve škodljivih ukrepov aktualne vlade. Da vrnemo normalizacijo državi,"" je dejala Fajonova. 
Tudi Mesec se je strinjal: ""Definitivno mora vlada začeti s tem, da se odpravijo vse škodljive posledice Janševe vlade. Inštitucije morajo spet dobiti avtonomijo."" Med drugim je izpostavil tudi prekinitev političnih posegov v javni servis RTV, Policijo ... 
Je možno sodelovanje z NSi in SDS?
Kakšne pa so možnosti sodelovanja s strankama SDS in Nova Slovenija (NSi)? Golob je jasen: ""Ne vidim možnosti (za sodelovanje z Janezom Janšo). Prej vidim možnost za programsko in projektno sodelovanje z NSi, vendar je v tem trenutku prezgodaj govoriti o tem. Za to bo čas po jeseni.""
Golob je veliko govoril tudi o sklenitvi novega družbenega dogovora. Kaj to sploh pomeni? ""Nov družbeni dogovor pomeni to, da postavljamo nove temelje za to, kako je videti socialno pravična in solidarna država, ki temelji na tržnem gospodarstvu,"" je pojasnil Golob. ""Hočemo vzpostaviti nov sistem, ki bo skrbel za naranljivejše na eni strani, hkrati pa bo odporen na to, kar se dogaja v svetu. Želimo, da je sistem odporen na zunanje vplive, kot so na primer epidemija covida-19 ali ukrajinska in energetska kriza.""
Ali lahko v vladni ekipi pričakujemo tudi Alenko Bratušek in Marjana Šarca? ""Mi v tem trenutku ne izključujemo ničesar. Najbolj pomembno nam je, da bomo kadrovali po strokovnosti. In strokovnjakov je kar nekaj. Namenoma govorim, da ne bodo imeli prednost samo tisti, ki imajo našo strankarsko izkaznico, ker bi to tudi ljudje zelo slabo sprejeli,"" je dejal in poudaril, da morajo pred tem najprej odpraviti škodljivo kadrovanje trenutne vlade.
""Seveda si želimo tudi LMŠ in SAB v koaliciji, ampak ne izključujemo drugih manjših strank, ki imajo lahko zelo dobre strokovnjake, pa se tudi niso uvrstili v parlament,"" je dodal. 
'Želimo si doseči dogovor, ki bo trajal vsaj dva mandata'
Janševa vlada ima odprto ""fronto"" s Sindikatom vzgoje, izobraževanja, znanosti in kulture Slovenije (SVIZ), ki zahtevajo zvišanje plač učiteljem. Bodo sindikalisti pri svojih zahtevah vztrajali tudi pri novi vladi? 
""Stavka je odprta in traja. Stavkovne zahteve smo posredovali vsem strankam, ki so danes tukaj. Vsi so se opredelili glede zahtev. Sklepam, da to ne bo pretežka naloga,"" je bil jasen Branimir Štrukelj, glavni tajnik sindikata.
Golob je dejal, da se bodoča vlada namerava sestati z vsemi sindikati in ne s posamičnimi. Šele na podlagi tega dialoga pa se lahko začnejo pogovarjati o reševanju nakopičenih težav. ""Želimo si doseči dogovor, ki bo trajal vsaj dva mandata,"" je poudaril. A Štrukelj ga je spomnil, da je celotni šolski sistem v stavki. Zato pričakuje, da se bo vlada lotila reševanja aktualnih težav. 
Fajonova je potrdila, da so stavkovne zahteve še odprte in izrazila mnenje, da bo treba iskati rešitve za prenovo plačnega sistema. ""Pred nami so težki izzivi,"" je priznala. 
Tudi Mesec je dejal, da je plačni sistem v javnem sektorju ena od prioritet nove vlade. ""Plačni sistem je v razsulu. Pokopala ga je Janševa vlada, uničen pa je bil že prej,"" je dejal. Vendar pa je opozoril, da se mora vlada dogovoriti, koliko denarja bo namenila za plače. Predvsem pa si, kot je izpostavil, v Levici želijo ""izbrisa sramotnega plačnega razreda J"". Ob tem je izrazil prepričanje, da mora država postati zgled dobrega zaposlovalca.
Golob je prepričan, da so politika in sindikati sposobni skupaj rešiti socialni dialog. Kot je dejal, pa posamezni ukrepi niso rešitev, ker bodo podirali razmerja. ""Morda pa je čas, da po dolgem obdobju, ko socialni sporazum nismo uspeli sklenit, to zdaj poskusimo,"" je upanje izrazila Lidija Jerkič, predsednica Zveze svobodnih sindikatov (ZSSS). 
OZS si ne želi poseganj v protikoronske zakone
Glede pričakovanj podjetnikov in obrtnikov je predsednik Obrtne zbornice Slovenije (OZS) Branko Meh dejal, da najprej pričakuje stabilno in močno vlado, ne želi pa si poseganj v 10 protikoronskih zakonov, ki da mnogim podjetjem odločilno pomagali. ""Ti ukrepi vlade so bili dobri. Marsikateri obrtnik je preživel zaradi teh ukrepov. Želim, da vlada razume podjetništvo in obrtništvo, da bomo še naprej lahko delali. Smo proti višanju davkov in proti višjim prispevkov na plače.""
Golob je na to odgovoril, da močnejše vlade, kot bo prihajajoča, Slovenija še ni imela. Napovedal je obdavčenje premoženja, ki da trenutno ni dovolj obdavčeno.
Dejal je, da se zaveda, da so bili številni obrtniki zelo prizadeti in obljubil, da bo nova vlada poskrbela za vse. ""Investirali bomo v delovna mesta. Dobili smo mandat ljudi za popolnoma nov način vladanja, za vlaganje v projekte, ki bodo ustvarjali večjo vrednost.""
Meh se je strinjal z Golobom, da je vlaganje v inovativno gospodarstvo prihodnost in dejal, da bo morala pri tem pomagati vlada z raznimi subvencijami, da bodo obrtniki lahko prišli do sodobnih strojev in da bodo konkurenčni na mednarodnih trgih. Povedal je še, da prevečkrat govorimo o davkih in poudaril, da so problem predvsem prispevki na plače.
A Mesec je pobude o nižjem obdavčenju kritiziral. ""Če hočemo met višje plače tega ne bomo dosegli z nižjimi davki. To je škodljivo. Če hočemo dobiti boljše plače, potrebujemo drugačno gospodarstvo."" Zavzel se je za ustanovitev razvojne banke.
Predsednica ZSSS Lidija Jerkič je povedala, da je davčna reforma potrebna, težava pa da je parcialno reševanje le te. ""Tukaj je treba ne samo dodatno obdavčit premoženje, treba je tudi postaviti nova razmerja znotraj dohodninskih razredov. Imamo srednji razred, ki počasi izginja. To je potrebno uravnotežiti. Gospodarstva ne smemo graditi na subvencijah, velja tudi enako za socialne prejemke. Tudi ti dostikrat prihajajo v napačne roke.""
Štrukelj pa je dejal, da bo plačni sistem v javnem sektorju eden od preizkusnih kamnov te vlade, ki bo morala sprejeti težke odločitve.
O reševanju energetske krize in pritisku na denarnice
Čeprav se je Janševa vlada v predvolilni kampanji hvalila z nižjimi položnicami za elektriko, pa je Golob opozoril, da bodo posledice energetske krize ljudi udarile po žepih šele jeseni. 
""Ocenjujem, da bodo cene zemeljskega plina najbolj kritične za navadne ljudi. Trg zemeljskega plina in električne energije trenutno ne deluje učinkovito. Glavna tema bo, na kateri nivo postaviti cene, da bodo dolgoročno vzdržne.""
Kako rešiti kadrovske težave v zdravstvu?
S kandidati za sestavo nove vlade se je soočila tudi Polona Gams iz Mladih zdravnikov Slovenije, ki je opozorila, da se je v zadnjih letih zvrstila kopica ministrov za zdravje. Izpostavila je, da je pomembno, da bo vlada stala za ministrom. ""Pričakujemo povečanje števila zdravnikov, da ne bomo gledali vsega le skozi prizmo denarja,"" je poudarila. 
""Minister za zdravje bo imel mojo 100-odstotno podporo. Dal sem zavezo, da bomo program, ki smo ga sestavili, podprli. Zdravstvo je prva stvar v našem mandatu,"" pa je odgovoril Golob. 
Fajonova je izpostavila, da bo potrebna obsežna zdravstvena reforma, ki jo bo treba izvesti s pomočjo socialnega dialoga. ""Če ne bomo sposobni ljudem zagotoviti, da pridejo do zdravnika pod enakimi pogoji, potem nismo uspeli,"" je med drugim dejala. 
Mesec pa je opozoril, da Levica ne bo podprla ministra, ki bo uničeval javno zdravstvo. ""Ne bi rad, da ljudje hodijo k zdravniku z bančno, ne pa zdravstveno kartico,"" je ponazoril.
Mladi zdravniki si želijo predvsem, da bi v novi vladi odločitve sprejemali skupaj s stroko in delovali povezovalno. ""Eden večjih problemov je pomanjkanje kadra, niso dovolj zgolj delovni inštrumenti. Govorim tudi o medicinskih sestrah in drugem pomožnem osebju."" 
Goloba je vprašala, kako bi stimuliral zdravnike in medicinske sestre, da ostanejo v Sloveniji. ""Zdravstvo je potrebno temeljito reorganizirati. Kar se tiče pomanjkanje kadra. Prvo je, da je kader slabo izkoriščen. Z neučinkovitostjo šibimo svoj zdravstveni sistem. Imamo pa tudi zaguljen sistem, kako pripeljati kader iz tujine v Slovenijo. Absurdno je, da je lažje pripeljati gradbenega delavca kot zdravnika. Prenoviti moramo migrantsko politiko,"" je odgovoril Golob.
Želja po stabilnosti, dialogu in sodelovanju
Gosti v studiu so bodočemu mandatarju izrazili tudi nekatera ključna pričakovanja do nove vlade. Štrukelj pravi, da je pomembno, da vlada rehabilitira položaj sindikatov, ki da so bili v Janševi vladi marginalizirani. ""Poskušalo se nas je odriniti od dialoga in sodelovanja pri ključnih vprašanjih. Te stvari pa bo treba uresničiti, ne samo podpisati.""
Meh pričakuje, da bo vlada razbremenjevala obrt in podjetništvo. Jerkičeva pa, da se v letošnjem letu ""vrne pravna država in sodelovanje civilne družbe - od nevladnih organizacij in sindikatov"". Želi si stabilnosti na daljši čas, všeč pa ji je tudi ambicija stalne vlade do leta 2030.
Fajonova je dejala, da jo je pogovor veselil. Zagotovila je, da lahko sestavijo stabilno in trdno vlado. ""S sindikati smo ves čas v navezi, tudi s civilno družbo. Čas je, da zaženemo ekonomsko-socialni svet,"" je še poudarila.
Mesec predvsem čuti veliko odgovornost. ""Dejstvo je, da smo vsi skupaj uspeli mobilizirati ljudi, ki so plebiscitarno zavrnili vlado Janeza Janše. Levica je lahko stabilen partner.""
Ob koncu je Golob dejal, da se svoje odgovornosti zaveda in ponovil, da bo deloval operativno, saj da drugače ne zna delati, ker izhaja iz gospodarstva. ""Izzivi so veliki, vsi bi si želeli vse in takoj. Vendar z majhnimi koraki bomo to dosegli.""

The president of the Svoboda Movement, Robert Golob, lists the Ministry of Health, Finance and the Joint Infrastructure and Environment Ministry as his party's priority areas. They also have their own candidates in the party for the latter. Golob does not want to reveal the names yet, as he intends to discuss this with coalition partners first. However, in the show Council on Channel A admitted that 41 deputies and the corresponding number of ministers were not counted on, so they will have to quickly find another ministerial name now: ""But that's why we are counting on other parties, including these, who may not have come to parliament to help us with their professional staff. ""","The Svoboda party won Sunday's election convincingly, winning 41 seats after partial unofficial results. Thus, it is expected that Robert Golob will get a mandate to form a new government.
He wants to form a government as soon as possible: ""According to the latest information, the parliament is supposed to meet on May 13 and we would like it to go very quickly from there. Now I will exaggerate a bit, but I would like to get a government in 34 days since the formation of the parliament, which means that we would definitely have a government there by the end of June, that is our plan, ""he said in an interview for the aforementioned show of our media house.
As for the coalition itself, he has already been in contact with other presidents, and talks will continue after the holidays.
Together with the SD party, the Freedom Movement has 48 votes. Enough, but sometimes too little ... Does Robert Golob want stronger coalitions? ""Yes, no doubt. We want to form a government in which there will be not only two parties. We would also like to invite the Left, that is, to have a center-left coalition, as well as two non-parliamentary parties that were in the KUL , these are SAB and LMŠ for sure, and maybe some of the smaller parties that also did not get into parliament, ""Golob explains that they want to transfer the mandate they got from the people to the widest possible circle of parties with which share the same values. He adds that he is grateful that they got so many votes, but at the same time he is aware of the responsibility.
Golob said a few days ago that they had all the names of the ministerial candidates ready, but even today he did not want to reveal them, as they intend to talk about it with the coalition partners first, which will be next week. ""It is true that we did not count on 41 deputies and the corresponding number of ministers, so we will have to quickly find another ministerial name. But we are also counting on other parties, including those that may not have come to parliament to help us with their professional staff, ""he admitted.
The day after the election, the first guesses
The post of health minister seems to be promised to the doctor and the party's parliamentary candidate Danijel Bešič Loredan, which he confirmed before the elections, STA writes. After the known results of Sunday's parliamentary elections, he said about the ministerial function: ""This is Golob's business. I have done my homework.""
According to him, the health care system will have to be calmed down and stabilized, the postcovid strategy will have to be changed, queues will have to be met and a way to change healthcare purchases and health insurance will be arranged within a year.
Many see the party's vice-president, Marta Kos, at the head of the foreign ministry. ""Given that we have been given exceptional responsibility and high expectations, we will urgently need people who are willing to work hard for Slovenia. I am that,"" she said to herself.
In recent weeks, the media have mentioned that the post of foreign minister may also be of interest to SD president and current MEP Tanja Fajon. For now, the SD only emphasizes that the division of departments will be a matter of coalition talks.
Urška Klakočar Zupančič, the second vice-president of the Freedom Movement, at the head of the Ministry of Justice, may also smile at the position of minister in the new government. As she emphasized in her statement, her sincere wish is that something contributes to making the country better, so she will take responsibility if it is entrusted to her.
In informal circles, the name of the President of the Court of Audit, Tomaž Vesel, was rounded up as a possible name for the candidate for Minister of Finance. Golob will meet informally with the President of the Republic Borut Pahor on Tuesday, and the official meeting is expected after the constitution of the new National Assembly. The first talks on forming a coalition with the SD, as well as with the Left, are expected to start on Tuesday.
In today's interview for Radio Koper, the leader of the Svoboda Movement also said that one of the party's priorities was to set the core of the future coalition or government, and that they would talk to all KUL parties and not only those who managed to cross the parliamentary threshold. . He is convinced that the coalition is not just a parliamentary body, but that politics is limited to acting in parliament, which in his opinion is one of the reasons why ""people said no plebiscites not to the parties, especially the center-left parties"".
""I think that the coalition is much more, it means cooperation, cooperation for the good of our society and cooperation depends not only on how many deputies someone has, but how much professionalism and knowledge the staff has,"" he added. At the same time, he claims that they are open to the staff of parties that did not join the National Assembly, among the latter he states LMŠ, SAB, ""maybe also Vesna and Dobro država"".
On cooperation with the parties of the current government - NSi has already indicated its readiness for possible cooperation - Golob emphasizes that time will show at which points program and project cooperation will be possible. ""We believe that this time will be in the fall, and there is still a lot of work to be done by then,"" he added."

Some of them performed at a concert on the Friday before the decisive weekend, encouraging citizens to turn out as much as possible. Their vote was heard, with nearly 70 percent of eligible voters voting. What do our celebrities think about the results of these groundbreaking elections?","After the election, Aleksandra Ilijevski spoke for our portal, who also performed with the band Pliš at the big concert Gremo volit! at the Republic Square in Ljubljana. She said that high voter turnout gave her hope that we Slovenes have finally begun to realize that elections give power to representatives of the people and that if they deny their mission and forget all moral codes, we can take it away from them. : '' The question is whether all those in power have become aware of this. For a start, it would be a lot if they cooperated with each other in the new government, as they did before the elections, because they also gained votes. They can take as an example all non-governmental organizations and activists who have supported us for these two years, reminded us of what democracy is supposed to be, and above all connected us despite all possible harassment and threats of the current government and its satellites. "" she concluded with a sincere: ""Thank them!""
The legendary Lado Leskovar also took part in the event, which took place a few hours before the election silence. A day after it became clear what changes were taking place in the political field, he said: ""I am satisfied!"" the fact that so many people responded to their encouragement to take part in Sunday's vote. '' At the concert, I said, 'Sing voter unless those others you don't want to take your vote,' '' he was an honest singer. He added that at the concert he dedicated the well-known song Among the Honest People to those who are coming, and the Last Train, on the contrary (visionarily) paid tribute to those who were leaving.

Members of the band Mrfy were also happy to attend Friday's concert. Bobnar Rok Klobučar could not hide his enthusiasm for 24ur.com today: '' Top! We won! '' He said that they came to the event before the election with the desire to help and that they are happy to be able to. They expect more positive things from the new government in the future, and above all they want more attention for cultural figures.
Matevž Šalehar - Hamo cannot hide his satisfaction with the fact that people went to the polls in such large numbers. In his opinion, this is a necessary thing, and he also added a few words on the topic of the election result: '' Results? Interesting! We do not know what awaits us, but we have hope. ""He added:"" The change that is to begin with is that criticism of politics will be allowed again. Now these criticisms have been suppressed, which is simply not fair to the citizens. '' In his opinion, criticism is important for politics, because it can only get better through criticism.
After a day that brought groundbreaking changes, Tinkara Kovač said: '' We have a difficult year ahead of us, in which people in positions of responsibility had to face problems they did not expect. Nevertheless, the outcome of the election showed a desire for change, and this should not be underestimated. '' She emphasized the desire for different times: it should impose a lot of responsibility on those who enter to this beautiful country of ours. ''

The day after the election, Marko Soršak - Soki, drummer of the band Elvis Jackson, also spoke for our portal. He first told the citizens: ""Do not be afraid of difference and a new attempt,"" and added: ""Everything promised is in any case published and recorded. The promise was made, it is time for action, '' he welcomed the choice and jokingly remarked: '' Finally Primorec! '' future: '' If we don't come together now, we are doomed. '' He is optimistic about the future, but with his feet firmly on the ground, stressing a major shift: '' Change will come with different energy, it will come indexes in relations with citizens. The result is optimal, but it will not be visible immediately, relationships and communication will be important. We will come together. '' Finally, he made a statement that is often resorted to on this topic: '' A good policy is one in which people do not know politicians by name. He has to 'run', we have to be happy and focus only on our (potential) private problems. ''
The Maribor singer Sebastian also gave his opinion, saying at the beginning that he was satisfied that new faces were coming, as he no longer trusted the old ones no matter what. According to him, they have had enough opportunities to date. With the results, however, he remains realistic: '' I'm not deluding myself. However, I am counting on reconciling communication and that the new prime minister will allow for a tolerant dialogue. ""He says that he does not expect changes overnight:"" He emphasized that he was happy that the government would finally communicate differently with the citizens and have a more calming effect, and that it would not encourage disputes and disputes among the people of Slovenia and would not act disruptively."

The submission of the law with the collected signatures was the last act of the campaign Let's go to the polls.","With the bill submitted to the National Assembly today, they want to eliminate eleven harmful legal provisions adopted by the government of Janez Janša. ""The need for this law arose due to a disruption in the democratic process in the last two years. The bill removes amendments opposed by the profession, addressees of regulations and the general public. and kindergartens, preventing the politicization of the police, providing nature conservation to nature conservation organizations, restricting the Minister of Culture from arbitrarily allocating public funds, and more, ""said Kristina Krajnc, a member of the Institute's program committee.
Nika Kovač, director of the Institute on March 8, emphasized that the Let's Go to the Election campaign proved that there is a consensus among people on public health, education and community: ""These are values ​​we will continue to fight for at the Institute - regardless of power But politics can be an ally or an adversary. ""
At the beginning of the collection, the bill was sent to all political parties, and support was expressed in Levica, Alenka Bratušek's Party, Marjan Šarc's List, Social Democrats, Svoboda Movement and Pirates.

According to the election results, this is expected to happen. As Tija Jakič, a member of the Institute's program committee, pointed out: ""We are glad that the Freedom Movement Party has committed itself to supporting our law, as this is the only way to immediately eliminate the bad actions of the previous government. ""We hope that cooperation with civil society will continue to be successful.""
As Alenka Kreč Bricelj pointed out, a strong community was established at the Institute on March 8: ""It was the most beautiful campaign because it was a people's campaign. People who went to the streets of towns and villages shared flowers, collected signatures at administrative units and We crossed the whole of Slovenia together by bus. There were wonderful people everywhere, from Lendava to Ilirska Bistrica, from Jesenice to Brežice, and everyone decided to have power. participation in elections. "" At the end of the campaign, they thanked all the volunteers who worked in various places in Slovenia.
Let's remember
The Institute on March 8 called for a signature in support of a bill against ""harmful measures taken by the authorities"" prepared by them. They are convinced that the bill drafted by the Institute on March 8 in recent months will ""eliminate in one fell swoop many of the harmful legislative changes adopted during this parliamentary term"".
As they wrote, they want to restore the power of employee representatives in the councils of schools and kindergartens and reduce the influence of politics on schools, the appointment of principals and the upbringing and education of children. They want to restore the status of nature conservation organizations, and they want to take away from the Minister of Culture the possibility of arbitrary decisions on the allocation of public funds and return power to expert commissions.
They want to prevent the political replacement of 126 senior police officers, prevent the Minister of the Interior from interfering in the conduct of the Police in pre-trial proceedings, and restore the independence of state prosecutors. They would deny the Ministry of the Interior direct access to data relating to the work of the Police, return full autonomy to the National Investigation Office and re-establish arms regulation. They want to disable the privileges of political officials in the crimes of threat and coercion.
They want to eliminate the ""lobbying Uber law"", which, in their opinion, further reduces the rights of workers and increases the possibility of exploiting taxi drivers.

They want the resumption of social dialogue and the conclusion of a social agreement, as well as the immediate discussion of their strike demands in the school union. On the other hand, businessmen of all trade unions point to a number of challenges that the new government will have to face, such as the recovery from the covida-19 pandemic and rising prices. In the medical profession, however, the new government is expected to address health problems as a matter of priority.","""Congratulations to all those who entered the National Assembly, and I want them to remember that they got the state under control, not ownership,"" wrote Lidija Jerkič, president of the Association of Free Trade Unions of Slovenia (ZSSS), in her first response. According to her, if relations remain as the partial election results show, Slovenia will have a more stable and majority government, which will have a much greater ear for democratic decision-making processes and, from the point of view of trade unions, for social dialogue.
According to her, the first steps of the government should strengthen trust in the state and its institutions, as well as the feeling of citizens that it is truly committed to solving their problems and that it respects them.
According to Jerkic, the results show that the majority of voters do not support the policy of separating the outgoing government and that it did not fall for all the candies distributed by the government in order to gain support. ""We are facing a period of consolidation in the face of challenging international circumstances. It is therefore important that the new government is strong and united - despite the opposition it promises,"" she said.
According to her, high turnout is a clear sign that citizens have exercised their right to active citizenship this time and that they really wanted change.
""We expect that solutions will not be sought in the reduction of social rights and the privatization of public services""
Jakob Počivavšek, President of the Pergam Trade Union Confederation, also praised the high turnout, which gives the election results extra weight and legitimacy. ""The first results show that it is possible to hope for the formation of a much stronger coalition than we have witnessed in the period since the last parliamentary elections, and consequently less political instability,"" he wrote in a response.
The first step of the new coalition should be the re-establishment of the Economic and Social Council and social dialogue, within which future measures should be coordinated, Počivavšek is convinced. Pergam also believes that Slovenia urgently needs a social agreement, the conclusion of which should be started immediately by the new government.
""First, in the short term, it will be necessary to find sources to cover budget deficits and the pension and health funds, and immediately start negotiations with public sector unions on public sector wages, left open by the previous government. In the medium term, pension and health reform and the issue of financing long - term care, as well as the future of the labor market, including tackling precariousness and reducing working hours, and the challenges of the digital and green transition, ""he said.
According to Počivavšek, it is difficult to predict immediately after the elections what kind of economic and social policy is being announced and what will be the solution to the challenges of public finances. ""We expect, however, that solutions will not be sought in reducing social rights and privatizing public services, especially health care, but in strengthening them,"" he concluded.
""It's actually about realizing we were sitting on the wrong train""
The President of the Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions of Slovenia, Branimir Štrukelj, said that the citizens had made it very clear that they wanted to live in a different country from the one to which Slovenia had been led by the previous government. ""It's actually the realization that we were sitting on the wrong train heading in the wrong direction, towards Budapest and against Iliberal democracy. Fortunately, this train had one stop in between - it was this election - and people jumped at the first opportunity from him, ""he illustrated.
""It is undoubtedly clear that this emptied democracy, this violation of the rule of law, the encroachment on media freedom, has been rejected. In these elections, the path to authoritarianism has been rejected,"" he stressed.
As a trade unionist, Štrukelj expects the new government to immediately rehabilitate trade unions as legal and legitimate representatives of workers' interests and to return to the social partnership that the previous government has ""completely devalued"". It calls on the new government to consider the social agreement, the broadest agreement in society, which would identify key economic and social issues.
As the General Secretary of the Trade Union of Education, Science and Culture of Slovenia, he expects the immediate start of negotiations on concluding a strike agreement or meeting the strike demands, as the union strike is ""still alive and active"". ""If I conclude from the reactions of the largest party to our strike demands before the elections, concluding a strike agreement should not be too difficult a task,"" Štrukelj added.
The economy hopes for a strong government in difficult conditions
After the elections, businessmen of all trade unions want to form a government as soon as possible, which will have a solid majority in the National Assembly, know how to overcome divisions on the left and right and work for the benefit of the Slovenian economy. At the same time, they point out a number of challenges it will have to face, such as the recovery from the covida-19 pandemic and rising prices.
""The path to a rich country and prosperity leads through a stimulating business environment in which people can employ and create a lot. For solidarity and the welfare state, economic development and investments, which create quality jobs and generate income for health and pensions, do the most. and social security in general, ""said Petra Juvančič, Executive Director of the Manager Association, after the elections.
According to the association, Slovenia is facing very important challenges, such as recovery from the pandemic, high inflation with reduced economic growth, rising prices of energy and other raw materials, lack of materials and components and interruptions in supply chains. ""Therefore, it is imperative that the economy and the state connect and cooperate in formulating a joint recovery strategy and looking for solutions that will have a positive impact on the operation of our companies and thus on the future,"" they stressed.
""Ourism"" in state-owned companies, which harms the entire economy and the international reputation of the Slovenian business environment, must also end. It is crucial for corporate governance that the management of companies and other organizations is taken over by capable, professional, educated and professional development-oriented managers, they pointed out.
AmCham Slovenia Director General Ajša Vodnik congratulated all those who were elected to the National Assembly, and especially the relative winners for their excellent results. ""However, we believe that politicians will be the absolute winners for Slovenia when they know how to overcome division and find a common development path for the benefit of all citizens of Slovenia,"" she emphasized.
As Vodnikova reminded, AmCham Slovenia has chosen the culture of dialogue as its basic guideline for this year. ""We want the level of communication to rise. What we witnessed in the election campaign does not belong in public discourse and reduces the reputation of decision-makers,"" she said.
""The times that await us will by no means be easy, but they bring an opportunity for Slovenia to maintain and increase trust,"" she added. According to her, one of the most urgent and important reforms is health and pension reform, in which broad consensus and trust are important.
""For the economy, in addition to the challenges of supply chains and the lack of resources, especially energy, the ability to acquire talent and labor will certainly be one of the key challenges,"" she said. cap. Otherwise, even more important staff will look for their opportunities elsewhere, which will also lose the development orientation of the Slovenian economy, she warned.
According to the president of the SBC - Club of Slovenian Entrepreneurs Joc Pečečnik, the result shows that left-wing voters are disappointed with the established parties, which they have trusted so far. “Personally, I expected a higher SD score,” he wrote. According to him, NSi is the only party that did not suffer an electoral defeat - it received even more votes than in the previous parliamentary session. He thinks the reason for this is their work and a good economic program that supports entrepreneurship.
Regarding the victory, which smiles at the Gibanje Svoboda party, he said that he and its leader Robert Golob in the SBC - Club of Slovenian Entrepreneurs found out that they have similar goals. ""And with this election victory, a new perspective in the country is certainly opening up,"" Pečečnik added.
In a small business, they want a stable government that will be able to connect the left and the right and will work for the benefit of the Slovenian economy. ""We expect Golob to form a government that will actually have a majority in the National Assembly,"" said Branko Meh, president of the Chamber of Craft and Entrepreneurship of Slovenia.
Precisely because of the elections, the OZS also moved the Crafts and Entrepreneurship Forum, where craftsmen and entrepreneurs traditionally present their demands to the government, to the time after the elections. ""We will ask the government what it will do for the Slovenian economy, especially a little,"" said Meh, wishing the ministries for small business again. He also wants us to stop talking about minimum wages, but to start talking about decent wages for a decent life for people.
After the elections, the medical ranks expect priority to solve health problems
In the medical profession, meanwhile, the new government is expected to address health problems as a matter of priority. Both the Trade Union of Physicians and Dentists of Slovenia Fides and the Medical Chamber of Slovenia expect, among other things, the regulation of appropriate remuneration of physicians.
According to Fidesz, the government and the entire Slovenian politics will have to recognize the solution of public health as the first priority and immediately move from promises to actions for the benefit of Slovenian citizens.
""We point out that Slovenian healthcare is calling for a comprehensive reform, and not partial solutions, which we were able to follow in the pre-election promises and which have repeatedly proved ineffective, starting with a salary reform that will bring remuneration closer to effective health care systems. Western European countries with the task of retaining doctors in the public health system, without which health care does not exist, ""they wrote in the response. They reminded that the solution to rewarding with the new systemic law in the field of health care lies in the drawer of the Minister of Health.
According to them, the reward system as we know it in Slovenia is the biggest cancer of our healthcare system and the main reason why both the most experienced doctors, on whom the treatment of the most demanding patients is based, and the youngest ones, on which the future of Slovenian healthcare is based, are leaving public health care.
The Chamber of Physicians wants a health care system that will be able to provide every resident with the timely, accessible, safe and high-quality health care services they need, based on the principle of solidarity.
They are also advocating the preparation and implementation of a national plan for human resources in health care and the introduction of incentives for work in areas that are less attractive for employment, both geographically and professionally.
They reiterate the demand of doctors to exclude healthcare workers from the single pay system. They also believe that a system should be set up in which a doctor can choose whether to work as a civil servant or as a private individual.
They need a renewal of computerization, which must lead to administrative relief and greater accessibility. They are also advocating for changes in the management of public health institutions, which must enable management to organize work processes more flexibly and reward employees, Beović added."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/robert-golob-s-cela-energetske-druzbe-poletel-na-vrh-vlade.html,Robert Golob flew from the head of the energy company to the top of the government,"Who is Robert Golob? The public knew him mainly as the chairman of the board of the energy company Gen-I. But his path at the helm of the company, which he has run since 2006, came to an end last year. After complications in the run for a new term, he withdrew from society and entered politics, where he led the new party, the Freedom Movement, to a convincing electoral victory.","The long-haired 55-year-old from Nova Gorica, who does not hide where he comes from, is considered one of the leading experts in the power industry in Slovenia. He won his last five-year term at the helm of Gen-I in 2016, expired last November, and did not get a new term to run the company due to opposition from the ruling policy, despite excellent business.
He said goodbye to the helm of the company at the end of the record business year 2021, when Gen-I generated 3.4 billion euros in revenue and 71 million euros in profit. According to the contract, Golob is also entitled to an award for last year's business, which he announced he would donate to charity.
High revenues were one of the main criticisms of Golob's government, when he was hurt and outraged by political harassment, especially of the ruling SDS, in the run for a new term, founded his own party and went to the polls with it.
Initially, he became active through the Be Change movement, but at the end of January he was elected president of the Freedom Movement party, which was renamed the Green Action Party, which was founded by Jure Leben. Golob's party was also joined by unaffiliated deputies Janja Sluga and Jurij Lep, who resigned from the SMC and DeSUS during their term.
The political orientations of the Freedom Movement were not precisely defined, but the party's vice-president Urška Klakočar Zupančič spoke in February with the president of the Renew Europe political group in the European Parliament, which unites liberal pro-European parties.
Golob predicts a different approach in politics from previous political elites. He will advocate for change in the country and for freedom, with an emphasis on the green transition, the rule of law, tackling health and intergenerational challenges, and digitalisation, he says. It also emphasizes care for vulnerable and socially vulnerable groups of citizens.
Among the first tasks in the event of joining the government, he announced the abolition of harmful laws adopted by the government of Janez Janša, also on the basis of legal solutions prepared by civil society.
He interfered in state politics during the early elections in 2011, when he was the vice-president of the then newcomer on the political stage - Positive Slovenia Zoran Janković. She celebrated the election at the time, but then failed to form a government.
The government was then taken over by Janez Janša, but due to the accusations of the anti-corruption commission, it began to fall apart. At the time, Golob was also among the candidates for prime minister in the effort to replace him, but he is said to have changed his mind just now for personal reasons, so Alenka Bratušek joined the fight and took over the leadership of the government. After the split of Positive Slovenia, he decided to support Bratušek, not Janković, and became the vice-president of her party ZaAB.
He has long resisted entering politics through the big door. He has said many times in the past that he does not want to be prime minister, but he understood that politics and the economy go ""together"", so he was in politics ""with one foot"".
However, when he decided to take this step, he immediately recorded high support in opinion polls, and throughout the election campaign he maintained high support, comparable to that of the established and ruling SDS. He did not seem to be harmed by the affair with the accounts in Romania and the alleged bribes from Montenegro, which he described as untrue, and the fact that in the last days of the campaign he was in self-isolation due to covida-19.
Golob is also active in the local environment, as a city councilor in Nova Gorica with his list. ""If you live in a community, you can't act like you don't care what's going on outside your home. You have to contribute to the common good, if not for yourself, then for the good of your children,"" he said in an interview. .
Golob was born in January 1967 in Šempeter pri Gorici. He graduated from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in 1989, received his master's degree three years later, and obtained his doctorate in 1994. He is married and the father of three children.
He graduated from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in 1989, received his master's degree three years later, and obtained his doctorate in 1994. After completing his doctorate, he visited the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta as a Fulbright Scholar and in 1997 became an assistant professor at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Ljubljana.
The area of ​​his professional work was the operation and deregulation of the electricity system and the restructuring of the electricity industry and electricity markets, according to his CV.
He is the author of numerous scientific publications and papers in the field of markets, energy source optimization and power system planning. He has led numerous basic research and industrial-application projects for the needs of the Slovenian electricity industry.
In 1998, he was appointed head of the EU's negotiating team for energy; Between 1999 and 2002, he was the State Secretary for Energy under the then Minister of the Environment, Janez Kopač, in the government of Janez Drnovšek. At the time, he was involved in drafting key energy laws.
In 2002, he founded and became the director of Istrabenz-Gorenje (now IGES). In October 2006, half of this company was bought by the state-owned Gen Energija, and with a new company contract, the company was renamed Gen-I."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/sd-ju-se-obetajo-tri-poslanska-mesta-manj-kot-doslej.html,SD worsened the score. Tanja Fajon: We have achieved our common goal,"The Social Democrats, led by Tanja Fajon in this election, failed to repeat the result of four years ago. At that time, voters gave them almost 10 percent of the vote and the same number of seats, but this time, after 97 percent of the votes counted, they received 6.3 percent support and seven seats. ""We have achieved our common goal, which is to start making changes, to lead Slovenia on a new path,"" commented Tanja Fajon.","The Social Democrats received 6.65 percent of the vote and seven seats, three less than in the last election and six less than they currently have in the parliamentary group.
Therefore, as expected, the party easily entered the National Assembly, but failed to repeat the result from 2018, when Dejan Židan took it to the elections. At the time, they were the third most successful party with 9.93 percent of the votes cast.
The party reiterated that it would be a success if they managed to repeat the result from 2018, and even in the first response, SD president Tanja Fajon emphasized that they were satisfied with the results. ""We have achieved our common goal, which is to start making changes, to take Slovenia on a new path. I believe that we will be able to restore people's trust in politics, and to return normalization to this country,"" she said.
She thanked ""for every vote that brings changes to Slovenia, and also for every vote of the Social Democrats"" and congratulated Robert Golob. According to the results of the parallel elections, his Freedom Movement received as much as 35.8 percent of the vote and 42 seats.
""I am looking forward to cooperating and working in the new government. Slovenia needs a stable and strong government, SD will be a guarantee for that,"" added Tanja Fajon. ""We're on the winners' side tonight."" He does not rule out the possibility that SD will still be ""on the podium"" after the votes have been counted. Regarding the remaining parties of the KUL coalition, Fajonova said that she wants as many parties of the current opposition as possible to cross the parliamentary threshold. “Each party will evaluate their own work,” she recalled, but stressed that they worked hard together and became good allies.
The first president of Slovenia, Milan Kučan, also appeared at the SD headquarters. He said that he expected Janez Janša's policy to be defeated today. On the convincing victory promised by Golob's Freedom Movement, he said: ""People wanted change so badly that they voted for the one who was the greatest guarantee that change would happen.""
Matjaž Nemec and Dominika Švarc Pipan, vice-presidents of the party, are also expecting results at the SD headquarters. ""The key thing is that together with the voters who took part in this election so en masse, we have achieved a key common goal - a change of government that has slowly led Slovenia towards an autocratic regime,"" she said. ""People have decided to change, for real democracy, to normalize the situation in this country, to restore confidence in politics as well. I see high voter turnout as a new trust and thus a new responsibility to politics, including us,"" he added. she added.
The German also emphasized that the basic goal was to change Janša's government. “We have been successful here all of us who have struggled for years, as well as the last few months, to make this big turnaround happen,” he said. ""If SD is part of the mosaic of social and moral renewal of our country, we will be very satisfied. We want to be part of this story,"" he added. Regarding the possible consequences of the poorer election result on the party leadership, the German replied that they do not think negatively today. ""Time will tell how the party or its membership will react. The most important thing is to form a center-left government as soon as possible and start very intensive work immediately before the summer, because we have a lot of work to do to return the country to where it is. it used to be, ”he said."

Zoran Stevanović (Party Resni.ca) announced that they have just started, Pirates are disappointed with the result and non-content of the campaign, the Healthy Society movement welcomes the increase in voter turnout, and the Alliance for the Liberation of Slovenia says the elections are invalid and discriminatory.","Stevanović: We have just started, the result will be much better in the next elections
According to the results of the by-elections, the Resni.ca party received 2.9 percent of the vote and remained below the parliamentary threshold, but the party's president, Zoran Stevanović, is satisfied with the result. ""We have just started, we are moving forward and in the next elections, of any kind, the result will be significantly better,"" he said in a statement to the media. “I am extremely happy, we really represent the voice of the people that has not been heard so far,” he said.
Asked by reporters if he was disappointed that they failed to make it to the National Assembly, he said no. “With such media machinery grinding in the regime’s fight against us, with all these labels that have been given to us lately, it actually positively surprised me,” he said.
""In fact, never in the history of Slovenia has such a miracle happened as today, that a party with a complete media blockade, no media space, no uncles from the background and no financial power structures has positioned itself politically on the Slovenian political scene,"" he said. He thanked all the voters who went to the polls, and especially those who voted for them.
The election results of other parties were expected for him, with the media support they received. ""With such a media space as the new face of the deep state, we would have succeeded in the elections with a 50-plus percentage,"" he estimated.
He announced that they would take part in all elections, including local ones. Among other things, they will run for the position of city councilors in Kranj, and they will also have their own mayoral candidate, he said in a statement on the party's Facebook page. The Resni.ca party was founded in 2021 and has not yet participated in the parliamentary elections.
Pivčeva satisfied with the result, Our country remains the representative of farmers in the long run
According to the results of the by-elections, the Our Country party received 1.8 percent of the vote. The president of the party, Aleksandra Pivec, is satisfied with the result, considering that the party has barely existed for a good year. The party is committed to continuing to be a vocal representative of the Slovenian agricultural area and the farmer, as well as pensioners and workers.
In a statement at the media center in Cankarjev dom, the president said that she was extremely happy and proud that the party had managed to establish a strong and solid membership base and create a party network in Slovenia in such a short time.
Their election campaign lasted one year, during which they visited all Slovenian regions, provinces, many villages and towns, where they also talked to people, said Pivec. ""We worked to represent the voice of the Slovenian farmer, worker and all those silent people who do not reach the political decision-making space in Ljubljana,"" she added.
The party believes that the Slovenian agricultural area has been neglected by politicians for a long time, and therefore undertakes to be their vocal representative in the long run. ""Regardless of the fact that we did not manage to cross the threshold of the National Assembly, we will not give up, we will continue to build the party,"" Pivčeva added.
Gale: The voice for us didn’t go to waste, we’re long-distance runners
According to the results of the by-elections, the parties Naša future and Dobra država won 1.6 percent of the vote. Their leaders Ivan Gale and Smiljan Mekicar are relatively satisfied with the result and say that they will continue with the implementation of their program. “The voice for us didn’t go to waste, we’re long-distance runners,” Gale said.
""Given that we are one of the youngest parties, we have achieved quite a good result,"" said the president of the Our Future Gale party. The president of the Good State party, Mekicar, added that their voters in both parties recognized the fight for honesty.
They assured all those who voted for them that the parties would continue their policies. “We are not a one-day project, we are long-distance runners and we promise you that we will continue our focus,” Gale said. As he asserted, they will continue to fight for integrity, justice, honesty. “This is just the beginning of a new story for our future in a good country,” Mekicar said.
Gale noted that they may not have had enough time to present their views, but as he recalled, they are in favor of a country without corruption or. at least much less than in the last 30 years. ""The key problem in the country is corruption, when we will severely limit it, better times await us all,"" he stressed. They congratulated all the parties that managed to get into the National Assembly. Gale commented on the victory indicated by the parallel elections to the Freedom Movement, saying that the rule of law was being re-established.
The Future Party, founded this year, has so far not participated in the parliamentary elections, and the Good State remained below the parliamentary threshold in 2014 with 1.5 percent of the vote.
According to the results of the by-elections prepared by the Mediana agency, the winner of the parliamentary elections is the Gibanje Svoboda party, which received 35.8 percent of the vote or 42 seats in the National Assembly. It is followed by the SDS with 22.5 percent. NSi (6.8 percent), SD (6.6 percent) and Levica (4.4 percent) would also be included in the National Assembly. The by-elections did not involve early voting.
Pirates disappointed with the result and non-content of the campaign
The Pirate Party of Slovenia is disappointed with the achieved result, which stopped at 1.6% support according to the results of the parallel elections. They are also disappointed that the election campaign was not focused on ""but against the elections"", said the party's president Boštjan Tavčar in a statement in the media center.
""I hope that our time is yet to come, because our future is based on content and young people, the vast majority of whom are a pirate party,"" Tavčar added. He also thanked everyone who supported their party and all those who took part in the elections.
The Pirate Party is already seeing itself in the local elections. This is the third parliamentary election for the Pirates. In 2014, they convinced 1.34 percent of voters, and in the 2018 elections they achieved 2.2 percent support.
Macerl: Environmental activists don’t usually win on short distances
According to party co-president Vesna Uroš Macerl, environmental activists do not usually win on short distances. ""We have come a long way,"" he said in his first response to the results of the by-elections, which show 1.4 percent support for the party. Vesna is satisfied with the result.
Macerl thanked voters for recognizing the importance of a true green party. ""We are satisfied with the result, we remain in the Slovenian political space,"" he said in a statement at the media center in Cankarjev dom.
According to Macerl, the campaign was a lesson for the party, in which they learned a lot. “There was a time when the media space was very narrowly ordered for us, when the cast was extremely recalculated and despite everything we achieved a result that we are happy about and it keeps us going,” he said. ""Given the need to adjust the way of life on this planet, we promise our children and all those who have given us a voice that we will not give up and make moves in the next election that will go in memory,"" he added.
Co-president Urša Zgojznik is also satisfied with the result. ""We are extremely pleased with the result, our campaign was clean and transparent. We had candidates in all constituencies, we had candidates we didn't meet yesterday, but we've done stories with them before,"" she said. According to her, Vesna is looking forward to tomorrow and the coming months. ""We think that Slovenia deserves one real green party that will solve local stories, which will set the direction for Slovenia, ambitious, sustainable and such that it will be suitable for all children and grandchildren,"" she said.
The Healthy Society movement welcomes the increase in voter turnout
The non-partisan People's List of the Healthy Society civil society movement welcomes the fact that voter turnout is increasing. However, they estimated that we are facing difficult times, in which, according to Gregor Kos, harmony will be needed from the movement. ""The fact is that since our beginning in January last year, we have been working on one key goal - direct democracy of citizens,"" Kos said in a statement at the media center in Cankarjev dom.
According to Kosovo, whoever will form the parliament and the government after the final results has difficult tasks ahead of them ""and the fact is that we will follow them in the movement as before - awake and every day"".
To the one who will form the government or. coalition or in parliament, however, said he ""should not dare to sign any agreement with the World Health Organization or plunge citizens into any new covid declared crisis"". We have difficult times ahead of us, for which we will need unanimity, he added.
According to the Alliance Let's Liberate Slovenia, the elections are invalid and discriminatory
The Alliance for the Liberation of Slovenia is very dissatisfied with the outcome of this year's parliamentary elections. ""The elections are discriminatory, invalid and unfair,"" Alliance candidate Ivan Bolfek said in a statement, saying he hoped the elections would be annulled.
Bolfek emphasized that as a candidate of the Alliance for the Liberation of Slovenia, he only got the first opportunity to present himself to the public and Slovenia today. He regrets that, as a candidate, he was unable to address his constituents, as well as that none of the representatives and chairmen of parliamentary parties and candidate lists ""mentioned invalid and discriminatory elections"" in this year's campaign.
According to him, this means that individuals in society pursue only their own interests, how to get into parliament, and no one cares about the constitution, laws and human rights. “We have endured the tyranny of this government for two years and everyone has focused only on this and on covid-19, and none of the candidates has focused on the economy, healthcare,” Bolfek stressed. He expressed hope that the elections would be annulled.
The Alliance for the Liberation of Slovenia has not yet participated in the elections."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/politicni-slovarcek.html,Do we cast ballots and count them? It's not that simple,"Only one more day separates us from the parliamentary elections, when we will decide with our votes which 90 politicians will occupy the parliamentary seats. We cast ballots and then the commission counts them. It sounds simple, but our electoral system is actually much more complex. We have prepared a brief summary of key information related to the elections. Do you know, for example, how parallel elections work?","As you already know, in the National Assembly elections, voters elect 90 deputies to the National Assembly. We can also remind that parliamentary elections can be regular or early if the National Assembly is dissolved before the end of the four-year term. We witnessed this in 2011, 2014 and 2018, for example.
The electoral process then begins with a call for elections announced by the President of the Republic. Borut Pahor called this year's elections for April 24. The official election campaign started a month before the elections, on March 24, and until then, all those who wanted to enter the election race had to submit their candidacies.
Parliament is a politically democratic body that brings together individuals elected by the nation to decide on its behalf.
The Slovenian Parliament is bicameral. It consists of the National Assembly, which is a 'general people's representation', and the National Council, which is a 'special interest representation'. Parliamentary functions are strongly concentrated in the National Assembly, which drafts laws.

Candidacy: The list of candidates can be proposed by a political party or a group of people
The list of candidates for deputies may be proposed by: - ​​a political party (in all constituencies, if they are supported by at least three deputies. It may submit it in a single constituency if it collects the signatures of at least 100 voters residing in that constituency, or 50, if the list was determined by members of the party who have permanent residence in the constituency) or - a group of people (with the signatures of at least 1000 voters with permanent residence in the constituency).
Some candidates also choose to run in two constituencies. They can do so if the counties are in the same constituency and if they run in both as part of the same list. In practice, this usually does not bring an advantage to the candidate, as after voting for his seat in the National Assembly, the average of votes in both units is considered. It is also important that no gender represents less than 35 percent of the total number of candidates on the constituency-level list. However, if the list consists of only three candidates, there must be at least one representative of each sex.
Constituencies and districts: eight constituencies, 11 constituencies and 90 deputies
Slovenia is divided into eight constituencies, in which 11 deputies are elected each, ie a total of 88 deputies, and one member of the National Assembly is elected by the Italian and Hungarian national communities.
Constituencies decide which candidates on the list will be elected, but candidates are not elected by constituency - the counties therefore have no influence on how many seats the list receives. Constituencies also play a central role in dividing seats between lists.
Circle, cross, arrow. How to mark your candidate?
""Only one (1) candidate shall be voted on by circling the serial number next to the name of the list preceding the name and surname of the candidate,"" the ballot instructions read.
Nevertheless, the district electoral commissions and constituency commissions received additional instructions from the National Electoral Commission (DVK): affect the outcome of the ballot paper. ""
In Slovenia, we have a proportional system for parliamentary elections
In Slovenia, a proportional system is prescribed for the election of deputies to the National Assembly, and the D’Hondt method and the Droop quotient are used to divide votes in constituencies and units (more on this below). Under this system, seats are to be divided in proportion to the support given to individual candidates and lists in individual group elections.
Mandates are always divided between parties that have exceeded the electoral threshold, first at the level of constituencies and then at the level of the entire country.
Roughly speaking, in addition to the proportional system, we also know the majority system, and in some places combinations of both systems are also used. In the majority system, the one who gets more than half of the votes wins.
After the voting is over, the electoral committees first determine what the turnout was, how many ballots were invalid, and then how many votes each list of candidates received. The same is done by the district electoral commissions for the territory of each constituency (88) and the electoral commissions of constituencies (8), followed by the state electoral commission (1) for the territory of the whole country. Only then is the division of mandates possible.
Mandates are therefore divided at two levels, first at the level of constituencies and then at the level of the whole country, as calculations at the level of units result in residual votes. At the constituency level, the Droop quotient is used, which was introduced in order to give as many seats as possible in the constituencies. Droop quotient
Droop's system - Droop's quotient is calculated by dividing the total number of votes cast by all voters in a constituency by the number of MPs elected in the constituency (11), adding another to 12. (similar, only without ‘plus one’), but if we added plus two instead of plus one, we would get the Imperial system.
To make it easier to understand, we will present the calculation on an example. Imagine that in a given constituency, 240,000 voters cast their ballots. The drop ratio in this unit is 20,000 (240,000: 12 = 20,000). Each list will receive as many seats as there are Droop quotients in the votes for each list. If the party received 55,000 votes, Droop’s 20,000 vote count is contained twice (55,000: 20,000 = 2, the remainder is 75), so the party won two seats. The mandates will be awarded to the candidates from those two districts (out of 11) where the party received the most votes.
All unallocated votes are passed on and taken into account when it comes to divisions of seats at the state level. At the state level, all lists are taken into account, with the exception of those submitted in only one constituency (and those that did not reach the 4% electoral threshold).
At this point, the D’Hondt system is considered. Under this system, the absolute majority of the votes received by the list is calculated first. Imagine that the party received 500,000 votes at the state level. This number is then divided first by 1 (500,000), then by 2 (250,000), then by 3 (166,666) and all the way to the number 88 (5682), as many as possible. In the same way we make calculations for all other sheets.
The list gets as many seats in the National Assembly as it had among the 88 highest numbers. In addition to the seats won by the list at the unit level, only the difference between the number of seats at the level of units and the state is calculated and the number of seats the list will receive will be determined. Let’s say a particular party won a total of 20 seats in all units. It has gathered 35 of them at the state level, and will therefore occupy 35 seats in the National Assembly. 20 seats have already been awarded, and the names of the elected deputies are already known.
The party has 15 seats left to allocate to the candidates. Candidates will be given seats in those constituencies where the party has the largest remaining votes according to Droop's quotient. If the seats in this unit have already been distributed (all 11), the seat is allocated to the deputies in the unit where the list has the next largest remaining vote.
Elections of deputies are conducted and conducted by electoral commissions and electoral committees. Electoral commissions are appointed for four years, and electoral committees for each election. The electoral commissions are: the state electoral commission, the electoral commissions of the constituencies and the district electoral commissions. The electoral commissions of the special constituencies are appointed for the election of deputies to the Italian and Hungarian national communities."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/odlocitev-2022-zadnje-soocenje-na-pop-tv.html,"Before the election silence: boasting, harsh criticism and guns in the corn","At the fifth and last confrontation on POP TV, party representatives spoke about the legitimacy of elections, corruption, media independence and civil society. Petra Kerčmar invited Robert Golob (Svoboda Movement), Janez Janša (SDS), Tanja Fajon (SD), Luka Mesca (Left), Matej Tonin (NSi), Zdravko Počivalšek (Connect Slovenia), Alenko Bratušek (SAB) and Marjan Šarc (LMŠ). We could hear self-praise, harsh criticism, not just one mention of a “rifle in corn”. It is also about a culture of dialogue, corruption, security and freedom. What put Slovenia on the world map? Representatives of the parties do not agree here, some pointed out the positive, others the negative points.","At the end of the show, the host of the final confrontation on POP TV Petra Kerčmar gave each party representative 60 seconds to address the voters.
The first man of the LMŠ party, Marjan Šarec, started by pointing out that voters had given them 12.6 percent of the vote in the previous elections. ""With this, we did the maximum we could. We did not rest in the opposition either. LMS in the government means a fierce fight against corruption, the fight for public health, public education, green transformation. We will return standards and democracy,"" he promised.
""We will talk little and work a lot in the next government. We will do everything that is good for the country and the people. We will advocate for debureaucratization, we will solve the demographic issue,"" said Zdravko Počivalšek, a representative of the Connect Slovenia movement and president of the Concrete Party. he called on all voters to vote.
""Changes are coming. We will solve health problems, youth problems and the problems of pensioners,"" said SAB First Lady Alenka Bratušek. She reminded of the solutions that have already been introduced, including public transport cards for pensioners. ""Changes are coming. We will solve the problems in health care, the problems of young people and the problems of pensioners,"" she added.
""We will provide 30 days to a specialist, 10,000 apartments, free school meals, a minimum pension and salary, a guarantee of a safe and social state. We want to create a country where young people like to return. We will defend a democratic and social state,"" she said. meanwhile, the clear president of the Social Democrats, Tanja Fajon.
What about the Left? ""You could recognize the Left as a hearty and militant party. We are a party that is on the side of the worker, precarious, student, retiree. A party that cared about the environment. It is important to take care of the climate, housing,"" he said. coordinator of the Left Luka Mesec and emphasized that every vote will count on Sunday. “We need to win as a bloc,” he said, adding that they are going to the polls as a group of five parties.
NSi President Matej Tonin emphasized that the NSi ministerial team did its best. ""In the next term, it will be important for Slovenia to continue to be an economically strong country. We must provide accessible safe health care for all. It is important that joy returns to Slovenia,"" he added.
""Slovenia is a wonderful country, wonderful people live in it,"" said Robert Golob, leader of the Freedom Movement. He praised athletes, entrepreneurs and innovators. He explained that a new social agreement had been reached in the party to build a new company. ""In the next eight years, we will lead Slovenia to one of the best in the world,"" he said.
""Elections are a celebration of democracy. Let's use the power of our voice. Slovenia has matured in the last 30 years. We have made progress, not only thanks to the current government, but also to all those who stand here,"" said Janez Jansa. ""The best is yet to come,"" he added.
Janša Month: You have been a politician of discord for the last 30 years
""What has happened that we have fallen so low when no communication is possible, no cooperation, when a distinct left and right poles have been established, do parties really need a divided nation to justify their existence?"" Kerčmar asked the guests and first addressed him to the president of the SDS: ""Why are we where we are?""
""The question of negative communication and bad dialogue must first be asked to yourself. Look at the content you have been communicating to Slovenian audiences for the last two years and everything will be clear. Nothing good is practically on the screens. we have to come together, we are looking for differences, instead of looking for what unites us, ""Janša replied to the leader.
The SDS president agreed that many things go across the border. ""For example, before the polls, these brochures were distributed in the early elections,"" Janša said, pulling out a brochure authored by Svetlana Makarovič and a national radio journalist. Janša also read a few words that were supposed to describe his client. “Rat party,” he read. He announced that he would read from this pamphlet in response to the accusations at the confrontation.
That people are fed up with such debates and that they want culture to return to dialogue, said the leader of the Freedom Movement, Robert Golob. ""I have set a goal to change the culture of dialogue in society. I like that this is the first issue we are starting to face, as this is our first promise to people,"" he said. ""Before that, we will make sure that hate speech is withdrawn from public space and sanctioned. This hate speech must disappear. If this means that I will be sanctioned myself if I use it, then I agree with that,"" he added.
Then the coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, responded and pointed out that Janša should look at his own profile on Twitter to see who is spreading discord in the company. ""You have been a politician of discord for the last 30 years. You have only expanded that in the last two years. We must first agree that the government is the first not to resort to hate speech,"" he was critical. Janša, meanwhile, disagreed with him and handed the ball back to Mesc: ""Mesec did not cite a single specific case in which an SDS member called for death, named another party, a rat party or insulted the fascists.""
""If we try to find points that separate us, then so be it. But we have to look for points that connect us. If you look at history, you will see: whenever we were united and cooperated, we achieved good results. At least in NSi we strive for decent communication and look for common ground, ”Tonin said.
The SD president said she was happy to talk about the dignity of communication. ""Our future depends on this - how politics will regain its dignity and trust. The atmosphere in Slovenia is toxic. It is toxic in politics and is spreading to other spheres,"" she was clear. Počivalšek, meanwhile, said that the Connect Slovenia movement was founded with the aim of ""connecting this sickly divided political space"". “We’re not just talking about it, we’re doing it,” he added.
""The LMŠ party has never encouraged hate speech since it was in the National Assembly, we have never insulted religious or political feelings. If someone has gone too far, I immediately reminded him of that. it plays a victim, although there is certainly no victim, ""Šarec was critical.
Then Bratuškova and Tonin got involved in a verbal duel. ""Slovenian society has never been as divided as it is today. And this is the fault of the current government. They do not respect the rule of law, they do not respect the law, people are divided into first and second class, Slovenia is led by Hungary,"" Bratuskova said. Tonin replied: ""Slovenia has been divided in the past, but it is important how we will deal with it in the future. Are we ready to look forward to success? It seems that a political culture has developed where the opposition is against any government proposal. It's about throwing logs under your feet. ""
The pigeon then slashed again over the Prime Minister’s posts on Twitter. That this is something completely different from the poetry collection mentioned by the SDS president. Janša replied that this was not a collection of poems, but a brochure distributed by politicians. He also pointed out that he never called journalists prostitutes, but ""prostitutes"". The moon, meanwhile, reassured him that people are not stupid. “It’s one thing if hate speech is used by the authorities and it’s another if it’s used by people,” he said.
Golob also warned Janša that the claims about his account in Romania were false. ""The more they lose, the more they lie. People are not stupid. People are fed up with your lies and they will tell you that on Sunday,"" he said. The coordinator of the Left, meanwhile, repeated Šarč's words about ""suffering expression and sheep's clothing"". To Janša's remark that the Moon is in fact describing itself with these words, he replied: ""Don't think of us as fools.""
On the legitimacy of the elections: 'Maybe someone cares about the election results and therefore prepares a backup scenario'
""It's not the first time that people abroad have received ballots too late or not at all. Many send us ballots only after the election. This is nothing new, I don't know why there is so much talk about it this year, if it's constant. practice, ""Janša said. Asked whether he would challenge the election results in case of irregularities, the Prime Minister avoided it, saying that he even found it suspicious that there was so much talk about it this year. . ""
Fajon also pointed out a number of irregularities. ""Concern is certainly present. I am worried because Vili Kovačič has already tried to erase the Left and the SD from the political space,"" she added.
""Problems are solvable, they have been solved in the past. Voting abroad can be repeated, deadlines can be extended. It's just a matter of will and whether we are ready to solve the problem or just dramatize it,"" the NSi president offered solutions. . ""It is unacceptable to problematize the election results in advance. We are doing everything to be legitimate so that everyone who wants to vote can vote,"" Počivalšek said.
""A scenario is being prepared in case the leading government party does not like the result of the elections,"" Golob also replied. ""Kovačič's constitutional complaint is the most telling. This is also the gentleman who made me the first application regarding my salary. This shows his interest. A scenario is being prepared that they will follow if they do not like the election results,"" he said. he said, but stressed that he still believes in the rule of law in Slovenia.
On Podgoršek's resignation and other irregularities: 'The Minister resigned after the house of cards collapsed'
Tonin pointed out that Minister Podgoršek's party did not defend him. “It was a mistake when I talked to the minister, he also resigned and that is the only real way to proceed about it,” Tonin said. Janša confirmed that he had accepted his resignation and would send it to the National Assembly.
""The minister resigned after the house of cards collapsed. It is right that he resigned, but this rarely happens,"" Fajonova was critical.
They went on to talk about Janša's lawyer, Franc Matoz. ""Mr. Matoz has quite a few controversial functions, but the most controversial is that he is placed in the management of the BAMC,"" said Šarec. Janša, meanwhile, denies any irregularities.
What about Šarč's case of Sova and the employment of an acquaintance? Or the findings of violations in the case of Počivalška? Both avoid responsibility.
""Pure Friday is now just a quartet,"" Bratuškova said of Minister Podgoršek's affair. ""It is inadmissible to argue with the decision of the courts or the decisions of the CCP. Tonin made it clear that he would not take responsibility in the final decision of the CCP. Similarly, Aleksandra Pivec did not take responsibility.
Golob says the case of the bill in Romania is not an affair. ""This is a fake account that the bank has already closed. The SDS has managed to create an international scandal. Other countries have responded to this, not only in terms of connection with me, but also in terms of what is happening in Slovenia. I have nothing to do with it, ""he said.
Rest: We are one of the few clients who can afford transparent finances
""We have about 10,000 members who pay membership fees, including strong entrepreneurs, but we have never raised enough money to finance the election campaign,"" Janša said in response to accusations of plagued Slovenia and campaign finance.
Tonin responds similarly: ""Our campaign is funded by membership fees and donations.""
""There is no corruption scandal in our country,"" Mesec points out. ""The fact that Bavčar's debts are being written off has been talked about in the media,"" he said of Simič's lawsuit. He also defended Marjan Šarc: ""They resigned from Šarc because of sandwiches. Did anyone resign from this government? But they had many scandals,"" he pointed out.
""In the party I lead, we have transparent finances. We have acquired everything in ways that are allowed by law. We are one of the few parties that can afford transparent finances,"" Počivalšek said. ""It happens that you have to decide between bad and less bad decisions, but you always have to keep Slovenia in the forefront,"" Tonin emphasized.
Bratušek gave Janša another critique of posters in Slovenia. ""Unfortunately, we have a government that does not want to face numbers that are not the best,"" she added regarding public finances. That the structural deficit is one of the highest in the EU and inflation the highest, she said, adding that the government should tackle it. Počivalšek, meanwhile, disagrees with her words and emphasizes record economic growth, the lowest unemployment and the highest ""state condition in the country's history"". ""I only believe in God now,"" he said.
""Two factors are the ones that have led to high economic growth over the past year. Construction and high consumption. None of this is sustainable in the long run,"" said Golob, who also noted high inflation, which will inevitable. ""Slovenia is in good financial condition,"" Tonin reiterated, adding that he was calm about the future. ""We have already begun to prepare for the consequences of the Ukrainian crisis,"" he said.
""I want to transfer more logic from the economy to the public sector and enable it to have a better service,"" said Počivalšek.
Are security and freedom mutually exclusive?
""Security is always a fundamental good. Freedom is important, but not what is written on posters,"" he said. He responded to Golob's criticism that construction was not a sustainable solution for Slovenia's financial progress. “Construction contributes to the well-being of the state,” he asserted, noting that they are building a third development axis, among other things.
Freedom or security? ""Always freedom,"" Golob replies. ""We have seen in the past how easily security is abused under the guise of security,"" he said, adding that dignity was also important.
""Freedom and security go hand in hand. Security is the foundation of everything. A strong economy gives us a good state,"" Tonin said. “Whoever sells freedom for security will lose both,” Moon is clear. He described the current situation in society: ""We have never been so quarrelsome, nor has there been so much corruption in the country, but no one has resigned yet.""
On one bank, there must be a strong welfare state and a strong democracy. If we want to give people a better and easier life, we at SD will revise the national recovery plan and make better use of refunds and grants. We have prepared a new plan. With this money and ambitious development we can focus significantly more on development, ""Fajonova said.

With this money and ambitious development we can focus significantly more on development, ""Fajonova said.
""The greatest dignity for Slovenians is if they can make a living from their work. That is why we are working to give young people a good job everywhere in Slovenia,"" says Počivalšek. He is pleased with the communication within this government. ""The result of our work is visible today.""
""Some people don't like my comparisons. Still. This government is behaving like a beautiful sunny day - it's hot, you've watched the weather forecast and you know the weather will get worse tomorrow, but the government keeps saying it's the sun,"" Šarec said.
Unfortunately, we forget the worse statistics, but critically Golob. ""We are at the top in terms of covid infections and covid victims. Also in terms of lack of democracy. How do you respond to that?"" ""This is not true,"" Janša replied, repeating Tonin's words that Slovenia was on the world map.
Dispute between Šarc and Janša: 'We are not guilty if you have a minority government'
""Those who had a rifle in their hands in the first half of their term only criticize what happened in the second half,"" Janša told Šarc. Šarec replied: ""You are boring with this rifle. I don't need a rifle because I have Šarec."" Janša again that Šarec does not have the courage. ""I think the whole of Slovenia is grateful that you threw a rifle in the corn. Because today would probably be awful if we stayed,"" he added.
""I have never thrown anything into the corn. If anything, you can see from my career that I am very persistent. We have set a strategy until 2030. We also want to restore Slovenia's reputation, which we have lost in international waters in the last two years,"" he said. said Golob. He also claims that even in the event of a loss, he will not withdraw from politics. ""I myself am not afraid of defeat. But what is defeat? It is defeat if this government succeeds again,"" he said.
""We will sleep through the matter, reconsider and make the right decision as always,"" said Janša, who said that they would rest in opposition. ""I am proud that Slovenia is now solid and visible on the European market. If anything, we managed to get Slovenia back on the European map,"" Tonin said, referring to the small size of the complex.
""Slovenia is on the world map, we have confidently placed ourselves there,"" said Janša, adding that we are among those countries that are listened to. “Because we have a reputation, we gain on the strength of the economy, we get important international events,” he added, crediting his government.
Šarec, meanwhile, pointed out that we are closer to Poland and Hungary, ie countries that have problems with the rule of law. ""Slovenia is on the European map after we congratulated US President Trump ahead of North Korea,"" agreed Mesec.
What will happen after the election? Which departments will they lead?
""We have put the restart of our health care system at the forefront of our priorities. We must first make sure that the health minister has the clear support of the government as well as the finance minister. This is our program to go to the polls,"" Golob said. Bešič supports Loredan as Minister of Health.
Tonin, meanwhile, has already proved in the current government that they are a successful and young team that has already proven itself in the defense department.
""We have excellent candidates with whom we can cover all ministerial work. The election results will show what we will do,"" Počivalšek replied. A month meanwhile, culture must also get its place under the sun.
""Today, it is absolutely too early to speak,"" said Šarec, who agrees with Golob: ""He who has a government always has a finance ministry.""
Janša, meanwhile, expressed astonishment at the question: ""The government has never met in front of the cameras in front of the people."" He adds that Slovenia is currently marked by security, climate development, the power of the passport: ""We are a nation of two million people, but we are still in tenth place in terms of the power of the passport.""
Fajon, meanwhile, was critical: ""You're putting on medals."" She praised the trust between the parties with whom they made a commitment, including Golob.
Tonin is happy that some are learning from their mistakes. He is convinced of the center-right government: ""It is not possible to delete all the projects currently underway in Slovenia.""
""Our government was a minority, not a majority, like yours, which then became a minority,"" Šarec told Tonin, advising him to sweep in front of his doorstep first. Tonin criticized the mistakes made by center-left politics in the past.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/kako-uresnicljive-so-obljube-iz-volilnih-soocenj.html,How achievable are the promises of politicians from electoral confrontations?,"Although it may have seemed to some that politicians did not get a chance for content and future in the confrontations, in two big confrontations and personal presentations of party presidents in the show SVET they made sure that voters had a chance to hear how they imagine Slovenia in the future.","Areas where customers have made the most promises are youth and housing policy. Nova Slovenija sees the most room for maneuver for young people to get housing, especially when they are placed in space in rural municipalities. ""Non-profit rent, and after five years the possibility of buying an apartment for young people,"" promised Matej Tonin.
Instead of the guarantee scheme proposed by the SDS, the Svoboda movement would give young people a tax relief for the first ten years: ""They will be able to reduce their income tax to zero if they invest this relief in real estate,"" Robert Golob promises.
Golob's, Janša's and one of Tonin's ideas are bad, says a young researcher who deals with housing policies. ""This is again a demand-side mechanism, which means that it raises purchasing power, which means that in conditions where there is a shortage of real estate, at least new, far too little, it leads to inflated prices. All quality housing policies must be based on increasing the quality of public rental housing, which Tonin says is one of the main problems in rural areas. which leads to spatial problems, public, transport, infrastructure and such construction is unsustainable from an environmental and social point of view, ""says a young researcher from the Faculty of Social Sciences Klemen Ploštajner.
Meanwhile, the women’s part of the policy promises to limit rents and build tens of thousands of nonprofit housing in seven years. ""In order to limit market rents, following the example of Germany and Austria, a room in the basement cannot be paid with a rent of 600, 700 or even 800 euros,"" says Alenka Bratušek. ""We have proposed, we can talk about numbers, a law for the construction of tens of thousands of public non-profit housing, according to which we could halve the price of rent between the ages of 23 and 29,"" said Tanja Fajon.
“Let’s say America, New York, has rent regulation in certain areas, which means it’s not something that would be taken from socialist countries, as someone would say, but it’s a classic rental market regulation mechanism,” Ploštajner explains.
The left promises a property tax on vacant apartments. But before that, they would obviously have a lot of work to do with the records. ""First we should know who the owner is and know clearly which apartments people live in. Which we don't have at the moment because people don't have registered rental agreements or temporary residences,"" Ploštajner adds.
Will we work longer?
With regard to pensions, Janez Janša would extend his employment in the next term. ""In part, the current pension system will have to be amended in the next four years,"" Janša said. ""We do not agree with what he is proposing, but it will not be supported. This was not accepted in the common positions in the White Paper and I do not think we will deviate from it,"" said Frančiška Četković.
Fajon would raise the minimum pension. ""Our goal is to provide at least 700 euros to everyone who has a full pension period in the next term.""
Šarec would change Janša's income tax law, Mesec would repeal it. “By 2025, this law will drill an 800-million-year-old hole in our budget,” adds Moon.
The Fiscal Council says that every law is about political decisions. ""There is always time for reflection, for corrections, for compensatory measures, but already this year, public finance problems are likely to erupt quite harshly,"" said Davorin Kračun, president of the Fiscal Council.
However, Počivalšek said that the deficit will be covered by high economic growth. ""That's not a realistic forecast. Economic growth should be at least six percent every year, which is unlikely."" In the last ten years, the average economic growth has been two percent."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/vpliv-twitter-politike.html,The impact of ‘Twitter policy’. How will customers improve online communication?,"The development of social networks and their impact on everyday life has strongly involved political parties in active participation on various online platforms. In particular, Twitter has become a powerful tool for promoting ideas as well as political reckoning. T.i. Twitter policy, which is most successfully pursued by Prime Minister Janez Janša, has received sharp criticism from the opposition. Above all, there are allegations of inadequate communication and the weakening of the political space and democracy. How will the parties handle social networks and communicate with the public in the next term?","The political landscape has changed considerably in the last few decades, with the Internet playing a major role in its transformation. Social networks in particular have become an important factor in political campaigns and people’s thinking on important issues. Candidates and their supporters diligently share posts on their profiles, and clients spread their propaganda and address audiences through the many online platforms available to them.
However, research shows that most people evaluate the impact of social networks negatively. A survey by the U.S. Pew Research Center shows that nearly two-thirds of Americans (64 percent) do not have a positive opinion of social media. Respondents place particular emphasis on misinformation, hatred and harassment.
The survey also reveals that users are concerned about the credibility of information, the promotion of bias and polarization by politicians. Among the positive influences, they mention the possibility of more direct communication with candidates and elected representatives. Prior to that, contacts with politicians were possible only through the participation of social and party events.
The European Parliamentary Research Center's Key Risks on Social Networks for Democracy points out that while social media provides citizens with new opportunities to access information, express opinions and participate in democratic processes, they can also undermine democracy by distorting democracy. information, inciting false stories and facilitating political manipulation.
So how will our political parties improve their online communication in the next term?
The Freedom Movement: The Twitter world is primarily an imaginary world of the prime minister and his followers
The GS advocates the principle of ""less Twitter policy"". According to the response, the way in which the highest representatives of the authorities communicated has weakened the political space and the reputation of political officials. ""The Twitter world is not a real world inhabited by the citizens of our country, but rather an imaginary world of the Prime Minister and his followers. In the Freedom Movement we will lead tolerant, respectful and inclusive communication at all levels of society, regardless of source.""
Left: It bothers us that politics has become theater
Even in the Left they are moving away from the t.i. Twitter policy. As they say, politicians do not understand it as a “reality show of competition in liking” but as an effort “for a more just and solidary society based on content”. In doing so, they give preference to other communication channels, where there are more opportunities for discussion and not just short statements, ""which are mostly intended for PR performance for the public and the promotion of conflicts"". Therefore, members and supporters are informed about the content topics and projects of the Left internally, by e-mail, and the public through the website and communication with the media. ""The fact that politics has become theater bothers us.""
LMŠ for tolerant and constructive communication
""At LMŠ, we advocate and implement tolerant and constructive communication in all its forms, not just on social networks. Unfortunately, some political actors use social networks in a way that does not contribute to the reputation of politics, reduces trust in it and contributes to the worst. - divides and deepens both politics and citizens, ""they wrote in a reply.
NSI: The user of this tool has a lot of responsibility for the echo of what is written
NSi is present on Twitter and guarantees that it will continue to ""respectfully communicate"" and ""contribute to raising the level of political culture in our country"". ""We are aware of the power of the word, both spoken and written, so the users of this tool have a lot of responsibility for the echo of what is written,"" they respond. Given the importance of digitalisation, they strive to be present on all modern online platforms and promise to continue to monitor developments in this area.
Let's connect Slovenia: Twitter policy has brought more transparency
The party believes that ""Twitter policies"" would be less if the media space was ""more balanced and there was no need to look for alternative ways of delivering messages"". Thus, they believe that this kind of approach has brought more transparency in a democracy, ""because everyone can express themselves directly, but on the other hand, with the desire for sensationalism, it has also brought more directness."" The PS believes that ""dialogue while shouting is impossible"", so they will strive for more tolerance in communication.
SAB: The level of online communication has fallen sharply over the last two years
""The key emphasis must be the fight to prevent and limit false news and hate speech in all areas of media activity, including the Internet. The media is one of the key areas for maintaining democracy,"" said Alenka Bratusek's party. ""We respect the human rights and freedoms of everyone, but we are aware that the rights of the individual are limited by the rights of others. We reject all forms of hatred, discrimination and hate speech."" As they say, they don’t get into fights. ""However, the level of communication online (and beyond) has fallen sharply in the last two years. The best measure to raise the level of communication is to set an example and constantly warn of the unworthy use of social networks.""
SD: We will use all available communication channels for communication
The Social Democrats ensure that the principles of responsible and respectful communication are adhered to in all communications. ""We will use all available communication channels, including Twitter, to communicate with the public. However, our way of communicating is significantly different from what is practiced by the current government headed by the Prime Minister.""
SDS: We do not intend to limit Twitter policy
Consolidated political parties around the world use social networks not only for promotion, but also to inform citizens with direct information, and the SDS views the use of social networks for party purposes. ""We point this out because it can be observed that distorted information reaches the public too often through the channels of traditional media, also due to the situation in the Slovenian media space."" The SDS defends ""the importance of forming one's own opinion on correct and clear facts, so we do not intend to limit Twitter policy."" They estimate that the SDS's online communication is good. ""Through it, we present our program and achievements, as well as relevant facts from the Slovenian political space.""
As social media are relatively new tools, we are just beginning to understand their importance and role in social and political life. Social media will certainly bring about a number of political changes, according to the European Parliamentary Research Center. ""There are proposals for internet voting, which could lead to greater turnout. This could make social media even more influential."""

It operated during the turbulent period of the covida-19 global pandemic, but also faced challenges such as the coalition’s internal problems and the failures of prominent members of the government who were accused of various mistakes or scandals. At the farewell, the government points out many achievements during its short term and is convinced that it could do even more in the new term.","One of the last opinion polls before the elections measured that more than 61 percent of respondents rated the work of the government as unsuccessful, and more than 31 percent as successful. Others had no clear opinion on the work of the government. The Janša government has faced a similar problem as many other ""crown governments"" around the world - its (un) popularity has been strongly influenced by the hated anti-crown measures. However, she has also been the target of accusations of some clumsy actions and mistakes that, according to her critics, have deepened people's sense of injustice, irregularities and divisions in society. Let’s take a look at some of the failures and scandals of the government that have employed the public over the last two years.
Supply of protective and medical equipment
The first high-profile affair was related to the purchase of protective and medical equipment to fight the new coronavirus. It resonated when Ivan Gale, then employed at the Institute of Commodity Reserves of the Republic of Slovenia, said that the purchases were dictated by the Minister of the Economy Zdravko Počivalšek, who was even supposed to determine the conditions. In response to the allegations, the government side emphasized that it was doing everything it could to mitigate the effects of the epidemic and provide enough necessary equipment. The government continued its work, but during this time the lost truck with masks of the Minister of Defense Matej Tonin and the business of the company Majbert Pharm, which supplied rapid tests, the quality of which was then in question, also resonated. fans, and the public was upset by “protective masks” made of napkins and erasers.
The allegedly controversial deals then came under the scrutiny of various institutions. After the publication of the audit report on the purchase of medical equipment in the covida-19 epidemic, the President of the Court of Audit, Tomaž Vesel, pointed out the poor coordination and dispersion of applications. He criticized the role of the Ministry of Economy and the fact that many offers remained unanswered.
However, after he was no longer State Secretary at the Ministry of the Economy, Aleš Cantarutti said in response to the CCP's findings that he had acted according to his conscience, and if he had been put in such a position again, he would have done the same. Počivalšek agreed that the system of purchasing protective equipment at the outbreak of the epidemic was inefficient, but that it is not true that the work of the government was inefficient. The government blamed its predecessor, the government of Marjan Šarc, for leaving empty warehouses.
In the end, the National Assembly ordered a parliamentary inquiry into the procurement and stockpiling of protective and medical equipment, which was to establish the possible political responsibility of public office holders.
To mitigate the effects of the pandemic on various segments of society and especially the economy, the government has adopted several anti-crown packages. While many were happy with the solutions and help, others pointed to the problems, and critics accused the government of using anti-crown packages for changes that should be regulated in the context of major legislative changes, and of pursuing its own interests. For example, the PKP packages also included interventions in doctors' salaries and an extended deadline for meeting the conditions for the establishment of a higher education institution.
There were also complications with the decrees defining anti-crown measures. Namely, the government did not initially publish the extension of the decrees in the Official Gazette, as it should have. Critics say such mistakes have contributed to people's dissatisfaction with the management of the pandemic.
Quick departure of the Secretary of State
Shortly after the beginning of his term, the government was left without a state secretary in the interior ministry. Franc Breznik was driving too fast on the Ljubljana bypass, but when he was stopped, he inflated 0.44 milligrams of alcohol per liter of exhaled air.
Breznik is said to be on the fateful day at the Derby company, known for importing bananas.
STA and other media
The government has often been critical of the workings of the media. When possible, she also tried to influence their performance. Thus, she blocked remittances to the Slovenian Press Agency for 280 days and wanted changes in the operation of the STA. Among other things, Prime Minister Janša accused her of the length of her interview with Zlatko. The government dispute with the STA has even aroused the interest of Brussels politics. Following the departure of director Bojan Veselinovic, who is said to be controversial for the government, a new agreement was reached with the STA. The government then turned its attention to RTV, and its employees repeatedly pointed out that they were the target of pressure. The sale of Planet TV into Hungarian hands and accusations of pouring money into media close to the ruling coalition also raised dust.
During the current Janša government, journalists were often the target of verbal attacks, and they were also the target of violence during protests. After one such event, the Secretary General of the European Union of Journalists, Ricardo Gutiérrez, strongly condemned the attacks on journalists and expressed solidarity with them. He wrote on the organization's website that it is worrying that Slovenian politicians are contributing a lot to the growing hostility and hatred of journalists.
""Enjoy while you can!""
The arrival of Jelko Kacin as the official spokesman of the Slovenian government for covid-19 aroused a lot of interest. Due to his often sharp, piquant and cynical tone, Kacin was trusted by many and aroused by others. When he said that Croatia could make a pilgrimage to the red list, he even upset the neighbors, who published photos of Kacin cleaning the pool on Krk.
At home, however, one of his most high-profile statements remains the remark “enjoy while you can”.
The Crown rhetoric is one of the activities of Janša's government that has also greatly employed analysts. Many accused the government of intimidating people and confusing communication.
Prime Minister in the company of Andrej Marčič
In September last year, photos of the Prime Minister in the company of Božo Dimnik and Andrej Marčič were released. Many became aware of this when he found himself in the tabloids due to the separation from his daughter Karel Erjavec, otherwise he is expected to earn more than 100 million euros of public money since 2003. At the expense of his Marand Engineering, the most money was poured from the Oncology Institute, more than 17 million, from the Ministry of Health more than 11, from the Ministry of Defense more than seven. Between 2007 and 2014, Janša's son was also employed by the company.
Janša, who is also expected to meet Marčič in Mauritius, said that he was playing golf with many people, accusing that these were controversial situations, and that this had nothing to do with any business.
Staying in hotels
The scandals took away both agricultural ministers of the Janša government. Aleksandra Pivec left the ministerial team in October 2020, when an affair broke out with the payment for a private stay in an Izola hotel. The events also accelerated the disintegration of the DeSUS party.
Jože Podgoršek then took Pivčeva's place, replacing DeSUS with NSi, which enabled him to retain the ministerial chair even after DeSUS left the coalition. But these days, the affair took him away. The bill for the holiday in the hotel in Bohinj was to blame.
Both Pivčeva and Podgoršek cited political pressure when they left, and Podgoršek even says that he is a victim of extortion. NSi withdrew him into the background after the affair, and Pivčeva returned to this election with her party Naša dežela.
Prlekija sandwich, (events) without masks ...
Although it was the government that ordered the anti-crown measures, they were violated or at least loosely understood by its members. Minister Počivalšek found himself in the Prlekija sandwich affair. During the measures, he met with local representatives in an otherwise closed inn, and then insisted that the use of the inn's premises for a business meeting was legal and justified because it was a permitted operation of the state.
Minister of Public Administration Boštjan Koritnik visited a beauty salon while waiting for the results of the test for the new coronavirus. He denied doing anything wrong. This was not his only ""offense"". Later, a clip appeared of him partying in one of the bars and staging a parody of the documentary The Tinder Swindler. He denied being under the influence of substances, ensured that anti-crown measures were followed, and ""claimed responsibility for any misunderstanding of the content of the recording"".
NIJZ director Miran Krek refueled at a petrol station in Ljubljana without a protective mask. In an explanation, he said he was tired and did not threaten anyone.
The case of the Minister of Education Simona Kustec, who appeared at the event of the Olympic Committee of Slovenia, resonated more, and the guests were without masks. Kusteč apologized, and Janša pointed out the government's decisions not to organize snacks at or after public events.
The visit of Borut Pahor, Matej Tonin and Aleš Hojs to Črnomelj was also the target of public criticism, as they walked in a larger group without protective masks and distance from each other at the time when such rules applied.
Croatian police refused to allow Interior Minister Aleš Hojs, who arrived at the border with his mother. Namely, they did not meet the conditions set by Croatia for the entry of foreigners. The minister later said he had not violated any ordinance, but wanted to check on how the Croatian police were doing their job.
Protests, Nika and Tea
Pandemic, decrees, other government decisions… All this has contributed to the fact that the term of the current government was marked by quite a few protests. Friday's protests have become quite traditional, and (alleged) organizers and protests have repeatedly earned not only harsh criticism from the authorities, but also punishment. Among other things, as they claim, because of reading the constitution in a public place.
The protests reached a boiling point on October 5th. Police used tears and water cannon in anti -corrosive and anti -government protests in the capital. After the incident, an affair broke out, the main questions of which were whether the Police exaggerated the use of force and why. The opposition found it controversial that politicians were present at the police headquarters on October 5 during the violent protests - State Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior Franc Kangler, Minister of the Interior Aleš Hojs and State Secretary for National Security Žan Mahnič.
It was turbulent between activists and politicians and vice versa. Janez Janša clearly stated that he did not agree with Niko Kovač from the March 8 Institute, who was critical of the work of the government. When she was chosen Slovenian Woman of the Year, he tweeted that during the pandemic, nurses or doctors are chosen for the personalities of the year all over the world - ""someone who sacrificed the most for others. In Slovenia, those who annoy the most."" Throughout his term, Twitter has been Janša's tool for communication as well as accounting. His supporters have often gone even further than the prime minister, and his rhetoric has often gone beyond what is offensive - often on both sides of the political spectrum.
Janša's meeting with Teo Jarc, an activist from the Mladi plus trade union in Kredarica, also resonated. Janša told the protesters that he ""did not know that Polje has an open day"". Many assessed that the response was not appropriate, while others agreed with it and assessed Jarčeva's behavior as inappropriate.
Foreign relations
During the Janša government, Slovenia held the presidency of the EU Council. But this was not the only reason why Slovenia found itself in the foreign press. Prime Minister Janša made it clear to everyone that he supports Donald Trump in the US elections. He also congratulated Trump on his victory, but the reaction was too quick. He later congratulated the real winner Biden.
The Prime Minister discussed the position of the media, the rule of law in Slovenia and the binding of European funds to respect for the rule of law with Brussels politicians, and the debate was often fierce. During the delegation's visit to Slovenia, he did not meet with the chairwoman of the European Parliament's Committee on Respect for Democracy, the Rule of Law and Fundamental Rights, Sophie in 't Veld, but he published a sexist tweet.
Conflicts with European politics have also affected coalition relations. According to one of Janša's letters, Tomaž Gantar, the then temporary representative of the then DeSUS coalition party, said that Slovenia was becoming one of the most problematic countries.
As we stepped into the election campaign, the Prime Minister went to Ukraine, where the war was already raging. Reactions to the move have been mixed, but the prime minister has also appeared in foreign media and at events when it comes to domestic effects, and analysts say he has further consolidated popularity among his supporters.
The boundaries between politics and the Police
One of the major and long-running scandals of the government was the relationship between politics and the Police, as allegations of unusual personnel decisions and influence, or at least attempts to influence, were constantly raised. During the investigations related to the purchase of protective equipment, Prime Minister Janez Janša assessed that political sympathy and media pressure have long been at the forefront in the selection of priorities of the NPU, the prosecution and the judiciary. He drew attention to some cases of multimillion-dollar damage to the state, in which no one has been accused or convicted yet.
The Minister of the Interior, Aleš Hojs, was accused of being the then v. d. Director General of the Police Andrej Jurič was instructed to take care of the audit of some already completed criminal investigations at the National Investigation Office. Sources said at the time that they had never experienced anything like this in the Police and that they were shocked by the instructions, as the largest government party was supposed to completely subjugate the Police.
The commission of the National Assembly also dealt with the alleged political interference in the work of the Police, which then filed a criminal complaint against the Director General of the Police Anton Olaj and the former Director General of the Police Anton Travner. Olaja is charged with several cases of harassment of employees in the workplace and obstruction of the work of the commission of inquiry, while Travner is guilty of false confessions before the commission of inquiry. Politics has denied pressure on the Police.
Staff carousel
In just the first nine months of his government, Janša's staffing counter was 1,117 appointments and 395 dismissals, while Šarčev's in 18 months of his government's term was 1,599 due to appointments and 440 times due to dismissals. Shortly after her arrival, the Janša government dismissed Tatjana Bobnar, Director General of the Police, Alenko Ermenc, Chief of the General Staff of the Slovenian Army, Dejan Matijevič, Kristina Plavšak Krajnc, Director General of the Defense Intelligence Service, and Ukom. and Rada Feleta, director of the government's legislative service. They also replaced Nina Pirnat, director of the National Institute of Public Health and director of the Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency Rajko Kozmelj. Anton Zakrajšek lost his position as director of the Commodity Reserves Institute. Critics say the changes were mostly based on obedience and political affiliation, while the political opposition insists it will check the staffing of the government, which is ending its term.
'Non-withdrawal'
During the exchanges, the 'non-resignation' also stood out. On 30 June 2020, the Minister of the Interior, Aleš Hojs, resigned ""irrevocably"", but he is still the Minister. A few days after Hojs' ""irrevocable"" resignation, Prime Minister Janša explained that he had not yet opened his resignation letter.
Stupid taxes, drinking water and Petrol shares
One of the ministers who was most affected by various accusations is undoubtedly the Minister of the Environment, Andrej Vizjak. It started with allegations that he bought quite a few Petrol shares, but then the government decided to fully liberalize the prices of petroleum products, which is also expected to affect Petrol's operations and thus the movement of the share price. The minister denies doing anything wrong.
Then came the referendum on water. Critics accused the minister and the government at the time that the controversial law contained articles that would allow coastal areas to be built up and endanger the accessibility of the coast, flood safety and drinking water. Opponents won, but Minister Vizjak remained in office. He assessed that the people in the referendum decided mostly emotionally.
A few-year-old recording of a conversation between Vizjak, then Minister of the Economy, and tycoon Bojan Petan also appeared. In more than an hour-long conversation, they touched on the topic of paying taxes four times, and Vizjak persuaded Petana not to carry out a deal in which he would have to pay several million in taxes. “That would be stupid,” he told him. Even after this affair, he remained in position.
Party disintegration and failed government overthrow
The stability of the government has often been called into question in the last two years, and there has been no shortage of interpellations - Simona Kustec, Aleš Hojs, Janez Cigler Kralj, Zdravko Počivalšek, Andrej Vizjak. they failed, as did an attempt to form a government led by Jože P. Damijan or Karel Erjavec, who temporarily returned to politics and burned infamously.
In this context, critics described as ""scandalous"" the fact that individuals and the government remained in the line of clear signs of irregularities, as MPs who could refuse to support the government did not do so for their own interests.
However, the coalition partners paid the price. DeSUS has collapsed, the SMC, which has meanwhile become Concrete, has become a completely different party struggling to survive, the NSi continues to have identity problems that would be more clearly separated from the SDS.
Among those who left in May 2021 was the Minister of Justice from the quota of the then SMC Lilijana Kozlovič. She left because of her disagreement with the complications in appointing European delegated prosecutors. This complication, which was the apple of the dispute between Janša and Brussels for a long time, was later resolved, and Kozlovič was replaced by Marjan Dikaučič. He soon found himself in an affair of his own. An investigation into the crimes of tax evasion, forgery or destruction of business documents has come to light. He denied the allegations.
However, the government expanded the ministerial team. Mark Boris Andrijanič from the NSi quota has become the minister without portfolio in charge of digital transformation.
Slovenian or Hungarian hotels
Government critics also responded when it appeared that Slovenian hotels could fall into Hungarian hands. That didn’t happen in the end. During the entire term of office, there were accusations against Janša's support for Orban. Many were also disturbed that there was no more violent response to Orban's monument with a map of Greater Hungary.
Achievements and merits
As usual, at the end of the term, the current government also consolidated its achievements. ""Slovenia is building and will build sports halls, nursing hospitals, schools and kindergartens, homes for the elderly, roads, bypasses and sewers. and added that this was ""the biggest investment drive Slovenia has ever been able to launch"". In his opinion, this will be the next step in Slovenia's development in a few years, based on which pensions and salaries will be higher, services will be better, there will be more investments and the business environment will be more favorable.
The government has therefore prepared a map of achievements. But it got complicated when the SDS flooded the country with posters about these achievements. Among other things, a letter was received from the Municipality of Slovenj Gradec, which reminded the SDS that the projects advertised on posters and online in the campaign were financed from various sources. The SDS replied that it would state this in online publications, which they believe will calm the municipal passions, which, in their opinion, have ignited unnecessarily. However, this time the SDS campaign was so resounding that even a website appeared where you can create your own ad.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/stranke-o-problematiki-starejsih-bodo-njihove-tezave-koncno-slisane-in-uslisane.html,Clients on the issue of the elderly. Will their problems finally be heard?,"Slovenia is one of the oldest European countries. More than a fifth of the country's population is over the age of 65, and more than five percent are over the age of 80. We are also the fastest growing company in Europe. Nevertheless, the elderly have been on the sidelines of politics for some time. In addition to new homes for the elderly, we also need comprehensive long-term care. Last year, we only witnessed a “historic moment” when we passed the long-planned Long-Term Care Act. But that is not enough. How would the parties regulate the issue of the elderly?","The share of the elderly is steadily increasing, while the number of people in employment is declining. In 2021, there were as many as 137 elderly people per 100 young people under the age of 15 in Slovenia. Older people with low pensions live on the poverty line and are also difficult to employ. They can wait months or even years for admission to nursing homes. Many cannot afford to be at home at all, and those who stay at home are not mobile and face loneliness.
According to the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, there are already 20.9 percent of people over the age of 65 in the country today. More than a fifth of Slovenes are above this age limit. Projections, meanwhile, predict that the population will only age in the future. By 2050, the share of the elderly population is expected to rise to 30 percent, and the share of the population over the age of 80 is expected to reach 11.4 percent by that year.
Despite the rapid aging of the population, the elderly have been on the sidelines of Slovenian politics for a long time. This became even more evident during the epidemic. The corona crisis highlighted the problems that the elderly faced on a daily basis, but those responsible did not listen. Will it be any different this time?
With the adoption of the law on long-term care we have reached a 'historic moment'
In addition to overcrowded homes for the elderly, the lack of a comprehensive law on long-term care and a number of other problems, the Office of the Republic of Slovenia for Macroeconomic Analysis (IMAD) also pointed out that the elderly were further discriminated against during the coronavirus. in accessing medical care.
However, the elderly have only finally reached the long-awaited and announced law on long-term care. ""This is a historic moment,"" Health Minister Janez Poklukar said when the law was passed last December. With him, after about 20 years of efforts, this area began to be systematically regulated.
The law sets out a series of measures aimed at adults who are permanently dependent on the help of others and need help with basic and supportive daily tasks. The system includes institutional care, home care, family caregiver and cash benefits. All forms of care, except institutional care, include the right to services to strengthen and maintain independence and e-care.
Despite the shift in senior policy, the law has garnered much criticism. ""We are disappointed and sad that the adopted law on long-term care is not good and does not solve the fundamental problem that has been dragging on for 20 years - systemic, stable financing of long-term care. The problem is only carried over into the future,"" .
The need for long-term care in Slovenia will increase more markedly after 2025, when the oldest generations will start to reach the age of 80, the IMAD predicts. Despite taking into account the fact that the elderly will be healthier and less disadvantaged in the future, and thus less dependent on foreign aid, public spending on long-term care will more than double by 2060 due to demographic factors, to 2.9 percent of GDP .
According to the Office, this increase in expenditure pressure could be exacerbated by non-demographic factors, in particular the growth of formal care coverage and the growth of long-term care costs. ""The European Commission's scenario that takes this into account shows that the share of public expenditure on long-term care would more than triple by 2060, to 4.2 percent of GDP,"" they added.
Homes for the elderly are overcrowded, entry queues remain
However, long-term care was not the only problem of Slovenian policy in the field of the elderly. For example, there is a lack of homes for the elderly. According to data published by the Association of Social Institutions of Slovenia (SSZS) on 20 April 2022, more than 12,000 applicants were waiting to be admitted to 125 homes for the elderly. In total, the homes can accommodate 21,573 people.
According to the SSZS report, 20,039 people were placed in homes. Despite the high prices of living in homes - the average care in public homes is 620, and in private homes with a concession 780 euros - so the desire to go to these care facilities remains. There are also waiting periods for entering the home. Ljubljana has been waiting the longest for admission to the home. Namely, a person comes to a home only if another person dies, moves to another institution or returns home.
According to the Srebrna nit association, the state also expects support from the state in the construction of modern public accommodation - smaller homes for the elderly, serviced housing, housing communities and rental housing. At the same time, they also want to expand home care and finance nursing care or comprehensive health care for the seriously ill in nursing homes, which will be comparable to funding in nursing hospitals.
Examples of good practice can be found abroad. Where will Slovenian politics turn?
Changes in the field of education are also urgently needed. With the rapid aging of society, the need for the professions of the future will increase. We will also need new profiles of employees who will be able to fill the staff gap in the provision of long-term care services.
Could you learn good practices from abroad? Many foreign countries are trying to help the elderly in various ways. Until recently, Slovenia was the only country in the European Union without a law on long-term care. Among other things, the Scandinavian countries have provided less pressure on nursing homes, as many elderly people receive the necessary care in assisted living facilities. Norway finances pensions from the government pension fund. This is a fund in which the surplus profit of oil companies is invested.
The Netherlands and Germany, meanwhile, are familiar with multigenerational housing and intergenerational housing, and Spain is successfully drawing on European funds for the needs of the elderly population there. How would Slovenian parties deal with this issue after the elections?
So there are a lot of problems, as well as open questions. For a series of pre-election articles, our questions were answered by eight political parties that showed the best results at the beginning of our election project. Their answers are arranged alphabetically. How would you address the issue of the elderly?
Freedom Movement: We will harmonize the Long-Term Care Act with key stakeholders
The Freedom Movement, which according to opinion polls is one of the favorites to win the election, says that they want to treat long-term care in a unified way within the ministry, which will unite all demographic policies. This, they emphasize, would enable a unified approach to the allocation of rights. ""We will coordinate the adopted law on long-term care with key stakeholders, especially experts, representatives of the elderly, regional civil society organizations and long-term care providers,"" they said.
As they say, they will prepare a financial structure for the implementation of the law, which will enable everyone equal access to services. At the same time, they want to connect long-term care and personal assistance services and services regulated by the law on social inclusion of the disabled with the new law, and in this way make them complementary or complementary.
They also talked about care in nursing homes. Its quality is related to several factors, among which they also placed adequate and decent pay for staff caring for the elderly in homes and other social welfare institutions. ""All homes for the elderly and other forms of community living must offer a quality standard of care,"" they said, adding that they would provide enough qualified staff for the proper functioning of long-term care.
""We will also introduce a family helper for the elderly (not just the disabled) who needs care and protection. We will provide periodic independent assessment of the quality of life in homes. We will also update the methodology for calculating the cost of institutional care for the elderly,"" they said. In the event of an election victory, they will also expand and strengthen the range of community social programs, such as intergenerational centers, day care centers for the elderly, and mental health centers that develop community support and provide preventive and other programs for vulnerable groups.
Left: We should invest in brothels, not grant concessions
Meanwhile, the Left Party points out the ""unenviable state"" of homes for the elderly in Slovenia. ""The lack of investment and development of services and the slow privatization of institutional long-term care have led to a network of public homes for the elderly over the past 30 years,"" they said. ""Instead of investing in public homes for the elderly, it carried out two tenders for concessions, thus providing additional profits to private individuals and passing on the costs of long-term care to the care recipients.""
They claim that the direct consequence of recent tenders for new concessions in the field of home care is an increasing number of private homes, which can charge their users higher prices of care on the basis of implementing regulations than in public homes. ""Instead of the state building public homes and thus solving the problem of 12,000 elderly people who would need a bed in the home immediately, home care is gradually being privatized and thus proven to be more expensive or less accessible,"" they said.
In order for long-term care to be provided with quality, it should be excluded from the market and provided non-profit as a public service, they are convinced. ""The second necessary condition is that the workers who provide this care are civil servants with stable, regular and fairly paid employment. Social dumping and precarization in this area are extremely harmful,"" they said. Too low wages are also harmful, they add: ""We must immediately raise the minimum wages in health and social care and pay workers fairly.""
They are convinced that rising supply prices are the result of privatization and the award of concessions in this area. They are announcing a war against ""earnings"" for private long-term care providers with a concession: ""We will no longer take into account the costs of financing or compensation for invested capital when setting care prices. (Assistance in maintaining personal hygiene, performing daily activities and assisting in getting up, getting dressed, moving, walking, communicating and orienting) may not be charged. ""
They also promise to enable the poor elderly to retain the right to care allowance even if they choose to stay in a home for the elderly, thus helping them to cover the costs of care and enable them to dispose of their own income. ""We will abolish the restriction on inheritance for testators who exercise the right to exemption from social security services and the contribution to the payment of funds intended for the payment or additional payment of the rights of a family assistant,"" they added.
At the same time, they will advocate the deinstitutionalisation of institutions in the field of long-term care. Involvement in the public system and sufficient funding will enable the organization of work that will enable the care recipients as much independence and freedom as possible, they conclude.
LMŠ: Structural changes are needed in the field of long-term care
""Long-term care in Slovenia is not systemically regulated,"" the Marjan Šarc List points out, emphasizing the need for structural changes, including changes in social systems, which will be the basis for new services, new forms of work and raising new financial resources to ensure financial stability and long-term sustainability of the system.
""The long-term care system must come from the individual, be based on the principles of universality, solidarity and equality, the active participation of the beneficiary and his free choice, and accessibility, quality and safety,"" the party said. In the implementation of the concept of long-term care, special attention will be paid to alternative forms of living with old age, with an emphasis on providing more help at home.
The following solutions have been prepared in LMŠ:

1. Determining the type of long-term care services and the standards and criteria for access to rights.
2. Ensuring stable financial resources for long-term care through a combination of available and acceptable public and private resources. Financial resources must be stable or independent of the economic situation, their own participation and redistribution of funds from the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia and indirectly from the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute are necessary.
3. Construction of public affordable homes for the elderly, additional capacities (beds) and day care centers.
4. Renovation of staffing standards in homes to provide staffing and professional reinforcements.
5. Establish an effective long-term care system by clearly defining criteria and criteria for assessing eligibility for long-term care and ensuring stable sources of funding. In the context of long-term care, the areas of family helpers and personal assistance need to be regulated and a uniform scale of conditions for entering the system, a basket of services and quality control needs to be established.
NSi seeks to make care for the elderly more ""attractive""
The Christian Democrats in the field of the elderly point out that after more than a decade of stagnation in the construction of homes for the elderly, a ""comprehensive investment cycle in the field of care for the elderly"" has been established in the last two years. 38.5 million euros are already earmarked this year for improving the infrastructure of existing homes and providing additional places, and more than 28 million euros next year. ""All these investments will enable better care for the residents,"" they assure.
They explain that the infrastructure in existing homes is being improved by eliminating tri- or. other multi-bed rooms, while ensuring that capacity in nursing homes will not be reduced due to concessions granted. The construction of smaller housing units with a capacity of up to 24 beds is also planned, which will be financed from the Resilience and Recovery Fund, they added. ""At the end of 2021, the total capacity of nursing homes was 19,205, and due to three tenders last year and this year, this number will increase to 22,697 beds in nursing homes in the coming years,"" the NSi party said.
They also cite the adoption of the law on long-term care, ""written in the spirit of deinstitutionalisation"", as an important step forward. According to them, this should enable the elderly to stay in their home environment for as long as possible, as in addition to care in the institution, they will also have the option of choosing home care, including e-care, or a family caregiver; for all beneficiaries, services are provided to strengthen and maintain independence. ""Through tenders, an even greater offer is planned within the day care centers for the elderly, which offer a daily program for the elderly while they are still living at home,"" they add.
“We are aware that human resources are crucial for the implementation of quality care and that the needs will continue to grow in the coming years, so we strive to make this profession as attractive as possible,” they say. Last year, the salaries of social welfare employees were raised by one to four salary grades. ""However, this increase was not reflected in the payment slips of the residents, as it was completely covered from the budget,"" they assure.
But wages are only the first step, they say. In the future, new standards and norms will have to be adopted in the field of social protection, which will enable better quality care for the elderly.
The goal of the Connect Slovenia movement is to protect the dignity of the individual
In the Connect Slovenia movement, they point out that pensioners, on the one hand, must not fall into poverty, and on the other hand, they must not feel socially excluded. “Therefore, we will pay a lot of attention to creating an appropriate social support environment, such as changing post offices into social centers where people can socialize and have all the necessary infrastructure available,” they say. These centers could also become areas of intergenerational coexistence, where children from local kindergartens, together with residents of local nursing homes, could learn digitization skills.
For those elderly people who actively participate in day center programs, the price of care would be reduced accordingly.
SAB also to increase the number of intergenerational centers throughout Slovenia
""The first step will definitely be the adoption of a law on long-term care that will be feasible and useful,"" the SAB said in a statement about its goals in the field of the elderly. They emphasize the need to ensure that pensioners can stay at home for as long as possible, and to enable them to spend their time actively in day care centers for the elderly throughout Slovenia. “Accordingly, we will strengthen the functioning of home care and provide adequate services and sustainable funding for long-term care,” they say.
Those who cannot stay at home, meanwhile, need to be provided with care in nursing homes, which they will be able to pay for with their pension, they point out. ""If a person has worked full time for 40 years, his pension must be sufficient for standard care in a home for the elderly,"" the party said.
At the same time, they will strive to provide more intergenerational centers throughout Slovenia. As they point out, these increase the quality of living in the third period of life. ""They will also need to be allocated adequate funds for the implementation of the programs, and above all to provide appropriate motivated and qualified staff,"" they added.
SD: Home help needs to be made accessible to all
The SD also emphasizes the need to establish a uniform standard of home-based care at a uniform price and with equal accessibility at the national level. It should be organized as a public network with the involvement of non-governmental organizations, social enterprises and volunteers in the system of publicly provided care. “Above all, home help needs to be made accessible to all people, regardless of the intensity of the needs,” they add.
Meanwhile, they also emphasize the importance of serviced housing, scattered fourth-generation homes for adult care, which will allow people to stay in their local or. local communities, and their construction must be encouraged and activated by the state.
""In the meantime, her task is to bring modern concepts of long-term care to our community, such as the family community, day care centers for the elderly, field services, hospice at home and new forms of coexistence and active aging,"" they said. As they add, the built infrastructure must be adapted to the active program and deinstitutionalization.
The main solutions they propose in SD:

1. New social insurance, to which the active and retired population will contribute according to options (progressive scale), with the aim of providing the necessary amount of additional resources (and integrating existing resources within this), in order to significantly reduce or eliminate the need and liability for contributions from descendants and relatives.
2. An integrated approach that takes into account the social, psychological and health aspects of the needs of the elderly, with a simple entry system and friendly treatment of users.
3. A single basket of services to which the user is entitled, with equal accessibility throughout the country.
4. Personalized services tailored to the life and lifestyle of each old person individually.
5. A uniform system of quality standards for home help at a uniform price and with a developed network of field services throughout the country, which will be organized as a public network with the involvement of non-governmental organizations.
6. Organizations run by older people, social enterprises and volunteers in the public care system.
7. Provision of additional investment resources to expand the possibilities for building social infrastructure in local communities, based on locally identified investment needs for various institutional arrangements of the public network of care for the elderly (homes are not the only possible solution).
8. Public quality control and rational use of long-term care resources, provision of quality staff for professional care and assistance to the elderly, including a system of promotion and inclusion of volunteering, development of complementary and alternative forms of community care such as housing associations, housing communities and sheltered housing and day care for the elderly.
SDS on the construction and adaptation of homes for the elderly
The leading party of the current coalition, SDS, meanwhile, points out that during the tenure of this government, after more than ten years of complete inactivity in this area, they started building and adapting most homes for the elderly. ""This, of course, also means better living conditions. We will employ more staff, who will also be (targeted) educated,"" they say in the party, adding that they will also increase the variable part of the salary. ""This will increase the motivation of employees for quality work,"" they are convinced.
He adds that several alternative forms of living are also covered by the adopted law on long-term care, which will soon be ""upgraded"" and updated with even more new solutions.

He expressed opposition to the war, but added that measures against athletes were unfair.","""I will always condemn the war. Given the fact that I am a child of war, I can never support it,"" Serbian star Novak Djokovic was quoted as saying on the sidelines of the ATP tournament in Belgrade, according to the French news agency AFP. ""I know how many emotional wounds he leaves."" ""But at the same time, I can't support Wimbledon's decision, which I think is crazy,"" he added. ""Players, tennis players have nothing to do with it. When politics interferes with sports, the consequences are not good.""
Organizers of Wimbledon, one of the four largest tournaments in the world, announced on Wednesday that Russians and Belarusians will not be allowed to perform on ""sacred grass"" due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine this year. Among other things, the second tennis player in the world, Russian Daniil Medvedev, will be left without a place in the tournament.
The All England Lawn Tennis Club, which runs the Wimbledon tournament, made the decision because they want to limit Russia's influence in the world. The decision has sparked much criticism. She was also described as unfair by the ATP Men's Professional Tennis Players Association. According to the association, this is discrimination, but at the same time, in their opinion, it sets a ""dangerous precedent""."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/arsenovic-zaradi-nasilnega-ravnanja-izgubil-vecino-v-mestnem-svetu.html,Arsenovich lost his majority in the city council due to violent behavior,"Maribor Mayor Saša Arsenovič lost his majority in the city council. Ahead of today's session, the List of Cyclists and Pedestrians announced that it was leaving the coalition due to the recent ""violent behavior of the mayor"". The mayor was not present at the meeting. Just before it started, he announced that he was feeling unwell, so the meeting was chaired by Deputy Mayor Samo Peter Medved.","Several city councilors asked Mayor Saša Arsenovič for answers regarding the recent incident when he was allegedly violent towards a 13-year-old boy. Igor Jurišič from the Youth Party - Greens of Europe would ask the mayor to explain the event. ""To take the time, leave the leadership to one of the deputy mayors, think in peace and when the picture is clearer, make a decision that he deems appropriate,"" he said.
""I am ashamed as a city councilor. Resignation would be the only correct course of action,"" added the representative of the Youth List - We are connecting Matic Matjašič. He called on Arsenovic to resign immediately and do at least 200 volunteer hours in a youth organization, ""where he will also be able to meet young people who are not from elite backgrounds.""
Primož Juhart from the List for Fair Development of Urban Districts and Local Communities (LPR) suggested that the mayor should not chair city council meetings until further notice. ""I see that he has already taken this into account today. According to the statute, the mayor represents the city council, but I don't think he is able to represent us at the moment,"" he said.
Independent city councilor Miha Recek was also critical. He wanted to hand over a written resignation statement to Arsenovic on behalf of the work of city councilors, ""which will show that you stand behind your actions"". He suggested that the sessions of the city council be chaired by one of the city councilors until the autumn regular elections, but the city council explained to him that this would be illegal. In the event of the resignation of the mayor, by-elections should be held, as there are more than six months until the regular elections.
The list of cyclists and pedestrians, which has four representatives in the 45-member city council, withdrew from the mayor's coalition due to the incident. ""We condemn the mayor's violent behavior and his arbitrary establishment of order on the streets of Maribor. City policy must condemn the mayor's arbitrary actions also because they would silently legitimize such taking of rights into their own hands,"" said their representative Josip Rotar.
The mayor's coalition now has 22 members, of which 11 are representatives of the Arsenovič list for Maribor. The list of cyclists and pedestrians was the second largest group in the coalition.
What did they conclude at today's meeting?
At today's session, city councilors confirmed, among other things, this year's price of the social welfare service family home help, which, despite the increase in implementation costs, remains unchanged for consumers, as the difference will be covered by the municipality. According to Deputy Mayor Alenka Iskra, this now amounts to 76 percent of the price of the service.
Without discussion, they gave their consent to the legal deal, according to which the facility in which the Tezno Health Station currently operates will become municipal property. They also largely agreed to run a gaming business at the Maribox complex, although some had concerns about the impact of the new gaming salon on youth.
In the discussion of the final account of last year's municipal budget, independent councilor Jelka Kolmanič pointed out that the municipality has never had such a good realization of revenues as in 2021, but investment expenditures are worrying, especially in kindergartens, schools and roads.
In 2021, the Municipality of Maribor generated EUR 126.3 million in expenses and EUR 127 million in revenues. The head of the municipal office for finance and budget, Mateja Cekić, said that some investment projects were postponed to this year because all the bids received exceeded the set value of the public procurement. She pointed out last year's rescheduling of municipal loans, as she believes that they would not get such a favorable interest rate today.
Today, the city councilors held the second reading of the strategy for sustainable development and marketing of the tourist destination Maribor for the period until 2027, which after the first reading was equipped with some additional explanations, including in the field of youth tourism and airport development.
At the end of the session, Deputy Mayor Medved said that the municipality had finally received a building permit for the dog park, so its construction will start this year."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/kako-bi-stranke-vodile-okoljski-dialog-z-mladimi.html,How would the parties conduct environmental dialogue with young people?,"Climate protests, conferences and agreements to limit global warming have prompted the general public to consider the Council's next steps in environmental protection. The fight against climate change has been an increasingly important topic in politics and among young people for the last decade. We asked the parties how their dialogue with young people on environmental issues will take place and whether they will include content on the rational use of resources in the school curriculum.","The EU and all its Member States signed the Paris Agreement in 2015, pledging to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Before the end of 2020, the EU presented a long-term strategy in which it committed itself to reducing its emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.
The realization of the requirements is much more difficult, it was shown at last November's COP24 climate conference in Glasgow, which ended with an agreement to limit global warming. But United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has pointed out that the deal does not meet science's requirements to limit global warming to an acceptable 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to him, the agreement is a ""compromise that reflects the interests, contradictions and the state of political will in today's world.""
The climate deal from the conference plans to reduce the use of coal, and the countries are expected to strengthen their targets for reducing emissions by 2030 by the end of this year in order to limit dangerous global warming.
The United Nations is not optimistic about achieving these targets, as it said in a September report that it expects greenhouse gas emissions to increase by 16 percent by 2030 instead of halving, limiting global warming.
Combating climate change is also important for young people
In Slovenia, decisions are increasingly being made behind closed doors, according to the Youth for Climate Justice movement, which has formulated its demands to step up the fight against climate change. They focused on ""the green transition, the transition from fossil capitalism to a more sustainable, more solidary and equal society"".
Therefore, at the end of March, five to twelve in three Slovenian cities and online, climate protests took place, following the example of the Fridays for Future movement.
With the growing awareness of young people about the importance of protecting the environment, scientists are noting that there is an increasing eco-anxiety among young people, which is not yet considered a diagnosed condition. It is mainly about the fear and awareness of young people about environmental issues, which, in their opinion, was underestimated by politics. Eco-anxiety is also linked to feelings of betrayal and exclusion from adult-led environmental dialogue, according to the Guardian.
The lack of dialogue was again highlighted by young people before the climate conference in Glasgow last year. At the time, the British minister urged them to go to class and demonstrate on Saturday and Sunday. At that time, young people accused politicians of neglect and of making decisions with a fig in their pocket. But environmental issues will have to go beyond mere exchanges of views. The concrete solutions needed to solve the problem would also affect the economy of endangered areas. However, the migrations of millions of people from sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America and South Asia, which they predict, could lead to dangerous social upheavals.
Successful environmental dialogue will therefore have to include the consensus of the wider society, including the coordination of the economy and politics, and, last but not least, talks with young people who will live and manage environmental policies in the future.
The paradox of fast fashion
On the one hand, drawing young people's attention to pressing environmental issues, and on the other hand, the rise of fast fashion. Danish researchers Nikolas Rønholt and Malthe Overgaard explored the paradox of fast fashion among young people. This is a big gap among young people, as they define themselves as consumers who care about the environment in the light of trends, but on the other hand they do not take these beliefs into account when shopping for the latest technological and fashion trends, Vox wrote. Discarded and even worn clothing and electronic devices have a major impact on the environment.
How will the parties' dialogue with young people take place when it comes to environmental issues?
How will individual clients solve the eco-anxiety that is also occurring in our country, and will they include content on the rational use of resources in the school curriculum, or will they talk more about it themselves?
The Freedom Movement would completely overhaul the field of education
""The field of education is crucial for the successful development of the country, as knowledge is the main carrier of development and success in small nations. The most important thing is public education, which is the main carrier of education."" According to them, the field of education in Slovenia needs a complete overhaul, since the last change was made twenty-five years ago. The first task would be to ""establish a system of overhaul of the whole system, which will include all stakeholders related to the system"".
In doing so, they will take into account the starting points set by UNESCO in the document Together we rethink our future: A new social contract for education. ""The renovation will cover long-term solutions and, in addition to traditional content, will include familiarization with the following areas: endangerment of the planet, green economy, digitalisation, citizenship education and human rights, cooperation and solidarity.""
According to them, the revision would also answer ""questions of taking into account the diversity of children resulting from the acquisition of knowledge outside school. Therefore, greater choice of part of the program will be introduced, especially for secondary schools.""
The key to the left is the realization that the current system of capitalist production and consumption is unsustainable
The party points out that they have talked a lot in the past about the rational use of resources and that they intend to talk about it in the future as well. ""The program aims to increase education on the causes and consequences of climate change at all levels of education and funding all scientific fields with the aim of finding an optimal and equitable transition to a carbon-free society. Every activism means responding to and solving social problems and their goals it is no less honest if individual activists continue to meet their existential, cultural and wider social needs in their lives through goods produced in an unsustainable way, by exploiting workers, etc. "" They are convinced that the key is to recognize that ""the current system of capitalist production and consumption is unsustainable"", as it leads to a threatening climate crisis and needs to be changed.
The Left believes that we can only change the system together and that the party is already cooperating well with various groups of young people, and it intends to continue this in the future. They emphasize that they are open to dialogue ""by working together to establish a broad movement to abandon the current unsustainable economic model"" which they believe is destroying the planet and concentrating social wealth in the hands of a handful, or to replace it with a more sustainable and just economic model "".
LMŠ would also empower the management of companies regarding the issue of climate change
They agree that climate change is increasingly at the forefront, but in their view ""both parents and teachers and, last but not least, health professionals are not sufficiently equipped with the knowledge to help them cope with phenomena such as eco-anxiety."" Awareness raising would be strengthened through programs, including new or updated curricula. It makes sense for them to ""empower the leaders of companies in the field of climate change to be able to cope with environmental change and understand the generation that is coming into the world of working people.""
The party would promote closer cooperation with heterogeneous civil society. ""Part of this cooperation is the involvement of young people and civil society in the Independent Climate Crisis Council as an expert working body responsible for evaluating government programs and preparing a draft carbon budget and possible remedial action.""
NSi would also focus on strengthening mental health
NSi is aware that ""we need to protect and preserve the environment for the younger generations and the future"". According to them, climate change is a common key challenge. ""We are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. Nova Slovenija proposes that the climate fund be used exclusively for the development of green technologies and the construction of devices for greater use of RES. new technological solutions, research and development. ""There is little time to achieve these goals, so we have proposed in our election program a number of projects, measures and solutions that will achieve the set goal.""
The party emphasizes that it is constantly in dialogue with young people and that they will continue to be open to proposals and solutions from young people in the next term. ""We will be happy to receive them in the National Assembly, as young people are full of innovative approaches and solutions. In its Green Form organizational form, we monitor and respond to environmental issues in even more detail.""
According to the party, ""connections and mutual solidarity are being lost in modern society"", so special attention will be paid to strengthening mental health, while also raising ""awareness of stigmas and stereotypes in this area in social care institutions and among employers"".
The Connect Slovenia movement would empower young people with projects
""Environmental protection is one of the foundations of the Connect Slovenia movement. The younger generation is paying more and more attention to sustainable development, as it is clear that concrete steps must be taken to reduce the impact on the environment. Politics have a duty to support them.""
The movement will advocate for a green and digital transition, which they believe also requires the introduction of the circular economy concept. ""We will pay attention to empowering young people with projects - for example, Dr. Nada Pavšer, coordinator of the movement, has led an extremely successful eco-school project in the past.""
The SAB would strengthen its monitoring of compliance with environmental standards
The SAB party also believes that the school curriculum should undoubtedly be adapted to current events and include the most current content. ""This includes raising awareness about the rational use of resources.""
They understand the eco-anxiety that overwhelms people, and that environmental events are appalling, ""although we sometimes feel that there is nothing we can do, it is the moral obligation of each individual to contribute to the achievement of environmental goals"". They believe that we need to be aware that we have only one common environment that we need to maintain together. ""At SAB, we are constantly emphasizing the need to leave the environment to descendants as little as possible and protected."" They pointed out that in 2016, on their initiative, the right to drinking water was enshrined in the constitution and that efforts have only intensified since then. In the coming period, they will, among other things, strengthen monitoring of compliance with environmental standards.
The SD is convinced that the school curriculum needs more content of an environmental and green nature
""Young people are the messengers and engines of change in Slovenia, as well as elsewhere in the world."" In their experience, young people live the values ​​they fight for, so they find this kind of patronage superfluous. ""A significantly more challenging mental leap will be needed in the middle and older generation, where consumer and other environmentally problematic life patterns are significantly more ingrained.""
According to them, concrete green policies and actions that have come from young people have prevented the implementation of measures harmful to health and the environment, and young people are already becoming an equal partner in politics. They highlighted the case of the water law referendum and climate protests. ""Activism has already outgrown the idea of ​​something that should be. Environmental policies are addressed by young people through concrete actions, and politics must support them in this."" They add that their party has supported young people in their efforts ""not only in words but also in concrete actions"" and that they will continue to do so.
The SD party is also convinced that ""the school curriculum needs more environmental and green content, and in a broader dialogue with the profession, parents, teachers and young activists, we will strive to make changes to the curriculum through positive agreements between the above and joint efforts. that the addition of the curriculum will not be one more content, but a logical expression of the time and challenges it brings - the environment is certainly one of the biggest, if not the biggest, challenges. ""
In the SDS, nature would be used several times for learning and research
The party also wants to provide education for healthy living through a program in the fields of education, science and sports, ""which also includes care for nature and environmental resources"".
They agree that curricula ""should include special emphasis on raising environmental awareness and transferring knowledge and experience between different stakeholders."" The party believes that we need to ""use nature more as a space for learning and an opportunity to explore. They believe that"" children and young people, as well as adults, should be provided with as much concrete information and experience as possible, how certain activities affect the environment the individual does so to minimize the burden "".
They believe that ""ecological educational content cannot go beyond moral consciousness, which is formed on the basis of knowledge and is primarily a personal characteristic or value of the individual."""

Take some responsibility!,"Elections should be taken not only as a right but also as a civic duty. This is an opportunity to express our will and co-decide what kind of future we want. Take some responsibility and go to the polls! This is what well-known Slovenes are calling for before the upcoming Sunday elections. Among the 50 faces who called for the greatest possible participation in the elections, we can also find Uefa's first husband Aleksandar Čeferin, as well as many humanitarians, non-governmental organizations, musicians and athletes.","""Don't say it doesn't matter,"" Ksenija Benedetti, the former head of protocol, wrote in her appeal to Slovenian voters. That it is not all the same that we Slovenes have to take responsibility and co-decide - 50 well-known Slovenes joined these calls. ""I don't know if everyone is really the same. Whoever doesn't go to the polls loses all right to lament, spit and complain about politics in four years. In every buffet, in every society. You didn't vote, you have nothing to lament,"" the TV presenter said. singer and actor Lado Bizovičar.
The campaign was also joined by chef grandmaster Ana Roš, head of the UEFA European Football Association Aleksander Čeferin, and humanitarians, actors, musicians and athletes. Sailor Vasilij Žbogar, winner of three Olympic medals, is betting mainly on young people. ""We are in a period when we have to show politicians that we are interested in this. That it is our responsibility and of course the right to determine the one who will lead our country in really very difficult moments like now.""
Among the famous faces is also the president of the association for a decent age, Biserka Marolt Meden. Even often neglected seniors need and want to co-shape the future for themselves and their children and grandchildren, he says. ""Even the voice of us elders counts, so it's important to say no to poverty, to say yes to the rule of law and democracy. And to say yes to humanity, solidarity and a peaceful society. That's why it's important that we go to the polls.""
Yesterday, Prime Minister Janez Janša also called on his constituents to go to the polls. He also left a meaningful message a few days before the decisive Sunday: ""We will fight to the last counted and verified ballot. So don't forget to control it.""
The philosopher Slavoj Žižek thinks critically about such signals that inspire distrust in the electoral system in a conversation with the coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesc. The rhetoric of the prime minister, who likes to accuse opponents of throwing a rifle into corn, is dangerous, he says. ""I see a greater danger in those who, at least in this way, let it be known between the lines that they do not intend to throw a rifle at corn. And in terms of congratulations to Trump, they will then try to repeal or at least procrastinate.""
Not only that, every election is important, it is a celebration of democracy, famous faces write. And it is worth celebrating, because, as the singer-songwriter Iztok Mlakar wrote: ""Don't tell me that you are not interested in politics, because politics is still interested in you.""
""Elections are a holiday and at the same time a guardian of democracy. This is one of the greatest achievements of civilization, that we have the opportunity to express our voice, to co-create society, community,"" added communication expert Aljoša Bagol on 24UR ZVEČER."

1. Would you go into politics if you extended your tenure in Gen-I? Probably not.
2. Would you run a minority government? Yes.
3. Would you agree that one of the parties would be supra-coalition? Yes, but he must not be in this government.
4. Will you keep the income tax law from the Janša government, which brings higher salaries? No, we will definitely change it.
5. Do you think salaries in Slovenian politics are too low? An interesting question. Politicians themselves have left low wages, and the entire public sector is paid significantly better than politicians. This disproportion is unusual. It doesn’t affect me, but it’s really unusual.
6. Would you repeal Lahovnik's law, which limits the salaries of directors in state-owned companies? I would completely change it because it gives the wrong signals. This urgently needs to change. Lower salaries and higher performance rewards.
7. Would you resign as prime minister if the CCP found a violation of the Integrity Act? Definitely.
8. Would you demand that a minister in your government resign if the CCP found a violation of the Integrity Act? I believe in the rule of law. I believe that politics must accept responsibility when control mechanisms find that something is wrong with it.
9. Is Zoran Janković connected with your client in advice, ideas, agreements or otherwise? No.
11. So you will also invite Janković to the headquarters, given that you will be in Ljubljana's Cvetličarna again? I do not think so.
12. Did long-term home schooling of children outweigh public health concerns during the corona crisis? No.
13. Will you demand that the Foreign Ministry belong to your party? No, that's not the key thing.
14. Will you nominate Marta Kos for Foreign Minister if you form a government? If Martha accepted that, yes. I think she is a great candidate.
15. Is a referendum needed for the second block of the nuclear power plant? Yes.
16. Will you introduce a property tax if you run the government? No, but we will change the property tax.
17. Is it right that Slovenia also helps Ukraine by sending weapons? It was right at the beginning, now we should focus more humanitarianly on Ukraine in our politics.
18. Do you have a bank account opened abroad? No, but I inquired about it at Furs, they told me they had found an open account in Bucharest, which the bank later closed on its own. There was never a single euro transaction on it.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/medved-z-ovadbo-proti-olaju-in-juricu.html,Bear with a complaint against Olaj and Travner,"Rudi Medved, chairman of the parliamentary commission of inquiry into the possible political responsibility of public officials on suspicion of inadmissible political interference in the work of the police and political influence on the course or outcome of pre-trial and other proceedings, announced a criminal complaint against current police director Anton Olaj and former director Anton Olaj. Travner.","The chairman of the commission, Rudi Medved, explained the background of the announced suspicion of committing criminal offenses by the current director of the Police, Anton Olaj, and the former director, Anton Travner.
As the chairman of the parliamentary commission of inquiry into the possible political responsibility of public officials for inadmissible political interference in the work of the police and political influence on the course or outcome of pre-trial and other proceedings, Medved informed the public that the commission had decided to send several notifications. suspicion of a crime. Complaints were filed today.
Olaja is burdened with several cases of harassment of employees in the workplace and obstruction of the work of the commission of inquiry. Olaj allegedly harassed the deputy director of the National Investigation Office (NPU), David Antolovič, and the former director general of the police, Tatjana Bobnar.
Medved estimates that Olaj's actions in both cases were politically motivated, which became apparent after Antolovič and Bobnar were summoned as witnesses before the commission of inquiry. Even before Antolovič's testimony before the parliamentary commission, Olaj introduced control over the work of the special commission for backlogs, headed by Antolovič. “This staged surveillance, of course, showed nothing,” Medved said.
After testifying before the commission of inquiry, Olaj also called Bobnar, and asked her in detail about everything she testified. At the same time, he was aware that the interrogation had not yet been completed, said Medved, who saw this as a blatant obstruction of the work of the commission of inquiry.
""We accuse Dr. Anton Olaj of blatantly obstructing the work of the commission of inquiry. This was shown by the witnesses who were questioned before the commission. Here we took a closer look at the case of Tatjana Bobnar, whom Olaj tried to scare not to testify before the commission. ""Olaj interrogated her in detail about everything she testified before the commission. He wanted to influence her,"" Medved said.
The commission of inquiry also filed a complaint against Travner. He is charged with false confessions before a commission of inquiry. He was interrogated regarding his alleged statement that Gregorčič's or Prior to his appointment to the post of Director General of the Police, the policy made it necessary to get rid of the director of the NPU, Darko Muženič, and the former director of the Criminal Police Administration at the General Police Directorate, Boštjan Lindav. ""Three witnesses testified that Travner, as the director of the police, told them personally. He himself, of course, denied this,"" Medved said. Based on past case law, Medved concludes that the weight of three words against one will be successful, but he emphasized that the prosecution will decide on this.
""We blame the former director Travner for false testimony before the commission of inquiry. He probably popularized the sentence that he got a condition from Gregorčič to take the place just to get rid of Muženič and Lindav. Three witnesses confirmed that Travner told them personally. ""He himself denied this as expected. According to all expert arguments, there is a suspicion of false testimony before the commission of inquiry. The prosecution will decide on this in the future,"" he said in a statement for the media.
Olaj himself is also announcing a criminal complaint
Olaj vehemently denies the bear's accusations and announces a criminal complaint. ""I again deny Mr. Rudi's malicious accusations against me. The suspect will be prosecuted without delay on suspicion of committing the criminal offense of Kriva ovadba under Article 283 of KZ-1.""
Some time ago, Medved announced a complaint against former Police Chief Andrej Jurič and Travner for false testimony, and for obstructing the work of the commission, as well as against Anton Olaj. ""All three directors are loyal soldiers of the ruling politics,"" he wrote at the time.
The work of the commission of inquiry has not yet been completed
Medved said that the parliamentary commission of inquiry would inform that it had not finished its work in this term. ""We questioned more than 30 witnesses, proved practically everything we indicated when the commission was set up. We proved interference in the work of the Police, political staffing and interference in pre-trial proceedings."" He assessed the investigation into interference in pre-trial proceedings as unfinished, specifically mentioning the pre-trial proceedings regarding suspicious purchases of medical and protective equipment, in which the Minister of the Economy Zdravko Počivalšek found himself.
""The most worrying thing is that the pre-trial proceedings are practically over, the indictment or several of them are practically written,"" Medved said. These papers, he said, ""stayed somewhere in the drawers at the NPU."" In this context, he also highlighted the unfinished investigation into the abuse of power in the excessive use of tear gas during protests.
""We are obliged to investigate this, so the commission is not finishing its work, thus paving the way for a new convocation of the National Assembly, so that when the new commission is established, it can continue the work we did in this convocation,"" Medved said. He is convinced that in the next term of office the commission will be able to reveal the processes of political subordination of the police during the rule of Prime Minister Janez Janša."

One of the guys from this company also trains at the club and he has clearly confirmed this several times,"" he explains, adding: ""The mayor reacted aggressively, ran for the bike, drove around behind them. and ran with full force into my son and another friend who hit him in the kidney. He grabbed my son by the neck and started threatening him and started yelling all over the field. ""
Arsenovich explained: ""I just wanted to stop the boy and teach him not to treat the common property in this way. I didn't hit or strangle him, but I took his hand."" ""If that was the case when the mayor claims, he would call me or the police. If I held his hand, I would come up and tell him he did the right thing and we could talk like adults,"" the father added.
The boy has such visible injuries on his neck today, his father shows us the photos, and Arsenovič replies: ""I don't know where he got his injured knee and bruises on his neck, I certainly didn't strangle him, but I stopped him.""
After Sunday's incident, Maribor Mayor Saša Arsenovič explained that he regretted the event and apologized to teenagers and their parents. He also apologizes to all Maribor men and women for not acting as they should. Despite the insults and obscenity, he should have acted less violently, so he apologized again. He just wanted to stop the boy and teach him not to treat common property like that. Because the boy was restless, communication was not possible, he explained. He claimed that he did not strangle or hit the boy, but took his hand. He explained that each medal has two sides, one we heard from someone who was not at the scene and one we heard now, the mayor said, adding that no violence had been confirmed and he was also convinced that no will be convicted. He once again explained that he should have acted differently and only warned teenagers that foreign property is not done that way and then left.
Meanwhile, city politics, including the mayor's coalition, also responded to the event. Some also called for his resignation. Arsenovich said that he was considering resigning, but after careful consideration, as well as numerous calls to stay in office, he decided not to do so. ""I think we've done enough good. But it's definitely not a source of pride for me or the city, so I apologize again,"" he said. ""I believe that political opponents are now trying to score points, but the decision will be made in November,"" he added.
Let's remember
On Easter afternoon, a group of teenagers stayed near the Branik tennis court in the center of Maribor and, according to the father of the attacked 13-year-old, took some used tennis balls from the rubbish bin. At that time, the mayor of Maribor allegedly passed by, asking the teenagers to return the balls, and then he allegedly physically attacked the 13-year-old and strangled him, among other things.
The father reported the attack to police and filed a motion to prosecute the mayor for the alleged felony of causing light bodily harm. The boy allegedly got bruises on his neck, as evidenced by the photo, and his knee also allegedly hurt. The mayor says he doesn’t know where the boy got these injuries from. “I certainly didn’t strangle him, but I stopped him,” he said today. Yesterday, Maribor police officers confirmed that they had received an oral criminal complaint on suspicion of committing the crime of light bodily injury.
According to the Večer newspaper, an eyewitness of the event appeared on social networks and said that the mayor did not strangle the boy, but grabbed him when the boy wanted to run away. The representative of the Branik Tennis Club, Klemen Kokol, denied that anyone would be allowed to use tennis balls. He confirmed, however, that damage had been caused to the club grounds during the holidays.
Arsenovich has been accused of alleged violence in the past. Ahead of the 2018 election, he had to defend himself against accusations that he bit off part of his finger at a waiter 20 years ago, allegedly grabbing his hand last fall and taking the keys from a young man riding a scooter through a pedestrian zone. ""I protect security in the pedestrian zone and I try not to have scooters there. Because we are creating these urban spaces so that we can meet there safely,"" he said in a statement today.
Many warn that any violence is unacceptable. ""Even if the motive and purpose were to insure property, this should not be an excuse for possible violent treatment of a minor,"" the coalition SD said after the event at the tennis courts. ""If the mayor saw that property was destroyed, he should call the police. Arranging such matters according to the principle of the Šiška Guard is wrong. Therefore, we expect his resignation,"" added Josip Rotar from the coalition list of cyclists and pedestrians. Independent city councilor Zvonko Zinrajh proposed convening an emergency meeting of coalition partners. Matic Matjašič from the Youth List. Connecting, who withdrew from the coalition two years ago, has already written a resignation letter to the mayor. ""In any mature democracy, in any mature city, the mayor would resign on Sunday, before the media found out about it. With an inappropriate response, he tarnished the reputation of the mayor and our city,"" he said after handing over the statement to Arsenovic today. ""For public office, the mayor deserves a certain behavior, an example that must not exceed the limits of violence,"" Matjašič said. At the same time, he adds: ""Even if the mayor were my immediate family member, brother or father, I would call him the same.""
The event is expected to resonate at Thursday's City Council meeting. The mayor also concluded today that he is aware that he should have acted differently, but the father of the attacked child does not accept such a late apology, he says."

When will this end?","During the epidemic, many patients were left to fend for themselves as they found it difficult to find a personal physician or not at all. Anti-crown measures thus took their toll, especially on the health of those diagnosed too late. Is it time to end measures to curb the spread of coronavirus in healthcare facilities? What about access to emergency medical care? How will these situations be resolved by parties whose opinion polls predict entry into parliament?","In Slovenia, the challenges of the health care system are considered to be one of the most pressing socio-political problems, and no major reforms in the field of health care have yet taken place. The corona crisis has pushed Slovenian healthcare into additional problems, as access to healthcare has significantly decreased during the epidemic. The cancellation of examinations and procedures, over-ordering, fewer referrals and fewer patient visits to GPs has worsened the health of many.
The introduction of coronary wards in hospitals and coronary measures in health care facilities, as well as the redeployment of health care personnel, have contributed to the fact that many interventions or operations that were not vital were dropped or postponed during the epidemic. Even visits to GPs have become almost mission impossible. Despite the fact that the waiting rooms of the dispensaries are empty, many people do not get the necessary treatment. Patients who are unable to go directly to their GP due to anti-coronary measures call clinics and send e-mails, but rarely receive a reply by telephone, and e-mails are often left unanswered. Although the waiting rooms are often empty, doctors are overwhelmed by the overwork. However, data from the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia show that personal and family doctors performed more than 1.2 million fewer examinations in their dispensaries in 2020 than in 2019, and last year this number decreased even more.
The number of preventive examinations has also decreased, on the other hand, the number of remote consultations has increased by almost 900 percent from 2019 to 2020, and by another 400 percent from 2020 to 2021. During the epidemic, doctors also issued significantly fewer referrals for specialist treatment or intervention. In 2019, they issued 4.2 million referrals, and a year later only 3.4 million, ie almost 760,000 less.
The epidemic thus further cut into the already poor situation in Slovenian health care, and the availability of emergency medical care became extremely reduced for many. And since the health department is one of the most demanding, and could be key to the success of the new government, we asked the parties to whom the latest opinion polls in the upcoming parliamentary elections show whether they plan to renovate the system of access to emergency medical care and in what timeframe. they will abolish the crown regime in medical institutions, which prevents access to health care.
Freedom Movement: We will pay for everything according to the services provided
To set a different, regionally coordinated strategy for treating infected patients, they say in the Freedom Movement. They intend to do this by placing covid-19 treatment in the existing health care system, ensuring equal treatment of all patients and defining a different way of treating and treating covid patients so that the health care system operates smoothly and no longer stops other health services. . ""There are no more queues. Therefore, the damage caused by the partial suspension of other health services will have to be urgently repaired. The Ministry of Health will form a crisis group, which will prepare an operational plan to eliminate delays in health services as soon as possible. , which have been suspended or reduced several times in the last two years, ""they promise. Special attention will be paid to groups of patients who are at risk of developing or developing serious diseases. The Svoboda Movement also promises that, on the basis of the Health Intervention Act, they will adopt an annex to the General Agreement, which will stipulate that all services are paid for after the services provided. ""Services will be available to all providers who apply to the system. Due to the huge number of people who do not have adequate medical care and are in queues for too long, it is necessary to activate all the potentials of the health system available. able to provide services, they will be able to compete for implementation, with the rules for the provision of public health services having to be determined and observed, ""they said, adding that the measure would be temporary until queues were brought to acceptable levels. They also explain that they will also ensure more efficient use of medical diagnostic equipment in public health institutions, as it is necessary to use all the capacities they have. ""We will pursue the principle that services must be provided with quality and determine appropriate control over the services provided,"" they added.
Left: More budget for the primary level
The Left explains that the availability of health services has decreased due to the epidemic, overburdened primary health care and the afternoon work of amphibian doctors who are actively creating queues, so they believe that the problem needs to be addressed at source. ""With additional funds, especially to strengthen the primary level of health care, accelerate the import of medical staff, increase the capacity of medical schools and define the medical service as a public service of special importance,"" they emphasize and promise to establish a system of planning and specialization the needs of the people, not the narrow interests of the medical guild. As the primary level is the backbone of the system, we are also in favor of incentives to make family medicine more attractive (eg housing). system. ""
The Left also promises to allocate more budget funds for health care and thus reduce out-of-pocket payments. They will thus provide more budget funds for the primary level, as the strengthened primary level will relieve the burden on the secondary level, thus actively shortening waiting times, they say. The Left is convinced that the health infrastructure at the primary level needs to be modernized, and at the same time the use of this infrastructure for private health care activities must be stopped. ""This is a phenomenon of so-called witch doctors, private individuals with a concession to work in the public health network, who do not have their own premises and equipment. in public health institutions, ”they explain. Therefore, they say, they will make the transition to a mixed system of health care financing, in which, in addition to contributions, budget funding will play a greater role. They will increase investment expenditures for the purchase of equipment in public hospitals and investments in integrated infrastructure. As promised by the Left, they will provide substantial budget funding for the primary level of health care, as the legislation allows it, ""and the current situation also requires us to do so.""
The Left is convinced that the crown regime in medical institutions is valid for a reason. ""Nosocomial infections are a serious threat that can endanger the most vulnerable and paralyze the health system. In the Left, we are convinced that the 'crown regime' in hospitals must be decided exclusively by the profession, not politics, and the state must provide reorganizing work so that the greatest possible accessibility of health services is maintained, ”they continue.
LMŠ for the digital transformation of Slovenian healthcare
The LMŠ believes that informatisation in public health care is not at the desired level, where they are convinced that the key challenge remains the lack of connectivity of all three levels of health care institutions. Therefore, they are committed to the digital transformation of Slovenian healthcare, which will be based on modern approaches, such as those introduced by the most advanced companies, and on the development of a unified and interconnected information system. ""This is the most important solution for efficient and effective access to health services. The Crown regime should be abolished as soon as possible, and the profession should tell in what way. However, the issue of waiting times needs to be resolved."" how many people are waiting, but how long does an individual have to wait from the discovery of his health problem to the beginning of treatment, ""they explain, adding that the health system must be organized in such a way as short as possible, taking into account the longest time . According to them, additional funds should be allocated to shorten waiting times and legal possibilities should be established for additional payment of all medical staff, ""not just the loudest doctors"".
NSi: The profession should judge and suggest further steps
NSi is convinced that in the field of emergency medicine, the success of previous changes and pilot projects must first be reviewed. On this basis, the profession should assess whether the planned system establishes the best relationship between the availability and quality of emergency medical care, and suggest further steps. According to them, the abolition of the Crown regime depends on the course of the epidemic and the proposals of the profession in this regard. ""The functioning of health care is gradually returning to the old ways. We are aware that after the epidemic, additional treatment will be needed for patients who did not come for examinations or interventions during the epidemic, so further implementation of the call to reduce waiting times will be crucial. capacities in Slovenian healthcare, ""they add.
Let's connect Slovenia: Decentralization and regionalization are key
According to the Connect Slovenia party, decentralization and regionalization, which are a fundamental pillar of their efforts, are key to access to emergency medical care. ""The development of emergency centers and the building of their capacities are the key to the availability of emergency medical care, with the vital interest of the Connect Slovenia movement so that public health preserves its potential. We must also place important emphasis on better organization of work processes,"" they said.
SAB: Public health has absolute priority
The SAB says that unacceptably long queues need to be brought to normal, so they will prepare a special program to shorten queues, provide the necessary funds and use all available resources under the cascade system. ""Public health has absolute priority, followed by concessionaires and finally private individuals. We will clearly delineate the work of doctors in the public and private sectors,"" they said, adding that both sectors were important to patients. so clear. According to them, the Crown regime should have been abolished long ago, ""we will have to deal with the backlogs that have arisen as a result of this regime"".
SD: The network of emergency centers is set up appropriately
In the SD, however, they believe that the network of emergency centers is set up appropriately. Slovenia is a small country, so we need to provide urgent transport, including by helicopter, which must be urgently regulated, they say. ""Given the necessary safeguards, there should be no excuses not to immediately remove the epidemic-related restrictions in public health. Accessibility of health services is our top priority,"" they explained, promising to regulate administrative assistance and communication with users immediately. organization of a call center as a complementary service to eHealth.
SDS: Today there is no longer a reason for limited access to a personal doctor
The SDS party explains that they have provided additional funds for administrators at the primary level, so they expect that the management of health centers will provide a permanent entry or contact point, where telephone and personal contact with the informant will be possible. ordering and informing patients. ""The Ombudsman of Patients' Rights pointed out that there are a number of complaints about non-response in some health centers, while concessionaires are very responsive to their patients,"" the SDS explained, adding that today there is no reason for limited access to a personal doctor. has become an endemic form of the disease that we will have to know how to live with.
The SDS also points out that emergency access for patients was not restricted throughout the epidemic. During this time, ZZZS enabled more communication by e-mail, which should be maintained for ordering, but by no means ""it is not appropriate to 'prescribe via e-mail', so we will make sure that general clinics are accessible"". The Ministry of Health is currently preparing the renovation of emergency medical care by starting the construction of satellite emergency centers in Slovenia, which will supplement the network of emergency centers at hospitals with satellite emergency centers at health centers. As they explain, a network of emergency centers and satellite emergency centers will be established at a distance of 20-25 km on the entire territory of Slovenia. ""We will ensure the operation of both dispatch centers and modernize 12-hour and 24-hour health care. We will also regulate the system of first responders, which today is based entirely on volunteer work, and automatic defibrillators in Slovenia are mostly procured privately,"" he added. they add to the SDS."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kaj-pesti-slovenskega-ekoloskega-kmeta-in-kaj-bi-naredile-stranke.html,Organic farming is a dead letter on paper? Most clients without concrete commitments,"Along with the production of high-quality and safe food, organic farming means sustainable management of natural resources and the implementation of the principle of animal welfare, according to the Slovenian Ministry of Agriculture. According to what was written, the decision-makers were aware of the importance of organic farming, but the situation on the ground shows that these are still just dead letters on paper. We asked the clients how they would deal with this issue. The Association of Organic Farmers of Slovenia wants more attention for organic farming, which is a poorly used opportunity in Slovenia that would help address both environmental and health challenges of the country. They commented on the promises of political parties before the elections, saying that for now there is a lot of mention of what needs to be done, but unfortunately there are no concrete tasks and commitments.","Most of the major players in organic products have not yet matured as an important market opportunity - if anything, more than raising the reputation with a minimum supply, says Dr. Martina Bavec from the Department of Organic Agriculture, Maribor Faculty of Agriculture and Biosystem Sciences. Decision-makers in Slovenia - not only politicians in parliament, but also many people from the agricultural profession or representatives of farmers - are still largely unaware that organic farming can be an important part of solving many problems related to agricultural pollution in the environment. potential for added value for rural areas and can also make an important contribution to human health when eating organic food: ""This is in fact the only truly sustainable agricultural production system which, thanks to strict additional controls and certification consumers, ""he said.
Since the first period of development of controlled / certified organic farming since 1998, during this period and especially after 2015, none of the otherwise competent agricultural organizations, including KGZS, and non-governmental organizations are engaged in planned and systematic work and assistance to farms for conversion to organic production, is critical of dr. Martina Bavec. As he points out, in the current financial perspective after 2015, conventional production using all chemicals can obtain subsidies per hectare higher than organic, which is not encouraging for the expansion of organic production.
The number of environmentally and health-conscious consumers who are looking for locally organic food in Slovenia is also growing rapidly, but current production is not following demand. This is a poorly used opportunity for our farmers, emphasize the Association of Organic Farmers of Slovenia (ZDEKS). Organic farming is not boutique, but serious and highly professional agriculture that can feed the population. They are convinced that this requires equal professional, legal, financial and research and development support, with due regard to the (financial) benefits for the environment, nature, production areas and the health of consumers.
Locally means everything that is grown and processed in our country, where the raw material is not necessarily produced in Slovenia and can also be very intensive (eg battery farming of laying hens in cages, intensive poultry production, genetically modified feed, hydroponic tomato production , the use of glyphosate in vineyards, orchards ...) or even more traditional with fewer inputs. However, it is true that many countries in the EU use significantly more agrochemicals than in Slovenia, explains dr. Бавчева. Organic production is determined by uniform legislation in the EU and additional controls. It is ideal to eat organic local production, he advises.
From 2012 to 2020, the area of ​​agricultural land intended for organic farming in Slovenia increased by less than half. EU agriculture ministers have backed an action plan to develop organic farming, which calls for at least 25% of agricultural land to be organically farmed by 2030. In Slovenia we are far from this goal. According to the Statistical Office of Slovenia, all agricultural holdings in the organic farming control system (3,689) accounted for 5.4 percent of all agricultural holdings in 2020, while those with ‘organic’ status (3,358) accounted for 4.9 percent of all. Organic agricultural land in use (certified) in 2020 (45,787 ha) compared to 2019 (44,455 ha) increased by 1,332 hectares (or three percent).
What bothers Slovenian organic farmers the most and why are there no more of them here?
The number of farms involved in organic farming has risen and fallen, according to the Chamber of Agriculture and Forestry of Slovenia (KGZ). According to them, the exits from organic farming took place mainly at the end of the programming periods of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which means that a large reason for the small share of organic farms in the demanding administration. Currently, the biggest obstacles for organic producers are the legislation, which is demanding and imposes a lot of additional paperwork on the farmer, too low incentives from the state and unregulated market conditions, according to KGZ.
Of course, natural resources are also an obstacle, farms in Slovenia are fragmented, we have a large share of small farms, farms that are in areas where farming is difficult. Even the weather conditions in recent years are not at all friendly to farmers. All this affects the decision of the farmer to enter into organic farming, where, among other things, problems are expected in the purchase of appropriate seeds, animals, animal feed, fertilizers, appropriate plant treatment products ... Also the implementation of processing (grinding grain .. .), slaughter and the rest is not as well-established as in the classic way of farming, they say in KGZS.
One of the important disparities is that more than 80 percent of all agricultural land under organic farming is grassland. And secondly, there are very few organic products from these areas under the grass that would be available to consumers. Thus, they find that in addition to the slow increase in the share of organic farming in both areas and farms and demanding administration, marketing and traceability are also problems, as many products from organic farms end up as a conventional product.
As pointed out by dr. Bavčeva, about 300 mountain organic farms left just after 2015, when the MAFF reduced the amount of subsidies for organic grass at the MAFF and unreasonably did not support small farms in the first phase of the current Rural Development Program and introduced it later - just before elections, he adds.
As pointed out in ZDEKS, this type of farming is much more demanding, so it takes more knowledge, will, ingenuity and also the courage to take up a rather unpopular branch of agriculture in Slovenia. Among the biggest problems, they point out the great lack of knowledge, the lack of properly educated consultants and the lack of promotion for organic farming, organically grown and processed products.
What are the possible solutions that customers should listen to?
Only intensive work in the field with correct information, preparation of a conversion plan, including economic indicators, vision and ensuring the sale of organic products at reasonable purchase prices, can be the solution for a larger number of organic farms, she is convinced. Martina Bavec.
In order to quickly increase the area under organic production, it is necessary to decide that all state-owned agricultural land, which is currently leased and cultivated by the most intensive agricultural holdings, must be organically cultivated, at least in the narrowest water protection area. after use, various agrochemicals and slurry can reach groundwater, he points out.
He adds that existing market-oriented organic farms have a problem with increasing land for organic farming, so a measure of priority lease of state-owned land for those who will organically cultivate, maintain and increase their fertility and reduce the negative impacts of agriculture could be easily implemented. to the environment. In addition, higher scoring and especially a higher share of co-financing of investments / projects in the field of organic agriculture are extremely important, advises dr. Bavec.
As Uroš Brankovič from ZDEKS points out, it is necessary to switch to higher crop production for people on flat agricultural land with higher fertility. It is also necessary to clearly promote the different types of food produced, and not to mix everything into the promotion of local food, he emphasizes.
The KGZ also finds that the purchase of public institutions is also a problem, where local and selected quality is too often equated with organic products, which is of course not the same. In order to increase the supply and sale of Slovenian organic products, it is necessary to create a market where there would be a constant supply and purchase, emphasize the KGZ. However, when creating a market for organic products, it is important that we all distinguish between the terms local, selected quality and organic. Consumers need to be made aware of the importance of organic farming and each individual must make a decision about their future.
They believe that what would give farmers the most desire and courage to switch to organic farming is the demand for crops and organic products, a guaranteed place in the market and connectivity between farmers to secure and maintain this place, they are convinced.
In order to achieve the growth of the number of organic farms in Slovenia, we must ensure the efficient connection of organic farmers and in this way enable them a better presence on the market, and KGZ is listing some other solutions.
How do they comment on the pre-election promises of the parties?
We therefore asked the clients what they will do to increase the share of organic farming and preserve smaller farms, which also contribute to the preservation of the Slovenian landscape? In which specific agricultural projects will they invest funds and how much (specific amount)? How much in local crop advertising? What will they do to promote jobs in agriculture? Despite the question of concrete amounts, most parties did not answer the concrete amounts they would devote to solving this problem.
According to the ZDEKS, where they also called on the parties to ensure that the next government will actually deal with organic farming, the reactions are different: They highlighted the Left, which, in their opinion, responded most concretely to the questions. Uroš Brankovič from ZDEKS observes a great commitment to food security among all customers, but also a mix between many explicit local organic and entire local production. Of course, they are in favor of as much local production and self-sufficiency as possible, also from certain quality schemes, but it is equally necessary to achieve at least 25 percent of the set agricultural land for local organic food, he points out. He adds that it is important to expand the share of organic farming much better in the regions with the best processing conditions: ""We expect that such strong support from the parties will be reflected in clear and loud and as public as possible the state and other high public representatives - not only for Slovenian food, but also as often as possible for Slovenian organic food. So far, this has been almost non-existent or only at events that were explicitly dedicated to organic farming. ""
He emphasizes that it is important to stop the loss or destruction of all agricultural land, especially the most fertile flat land: ""Politicians are full of this goal or effort, but in the last 10 years there has been lost land in half the area of ​​the City of Ljubljana."" Replacing the construction of the best land with alternative agricultural land is more or less sand in the eye, as is the prospect of deforestation. As well as agricultural land in the lowlands, lowland forests are also endangered or rare. The solution is greater use of degraded areas, e.g. former industrial zones, he estimates. ""Customers are promising to invest in the development of agriculture, its digitalization, financial subsidies for producers, more legal opportunities to promote the use of Slovenian food, such as in public institutions,"" but he said.
It is also important to emphasize the great importance of organic farming in production in climatic conditions, especially droughts, and only investments in spraying, irrigation, safety nets will not solve this, it is also important that organic soils are more drought resistant due to more organic matter. , further points out. He adds that they also want comprehensive support for organic farming in the share of total agriculture, ie 25 percent. This means not only direct financial subsidies, but also such a share of agricultural advisers that they are only organic and not mixed, in agricultural research and innovation, in seed production, in promotional activities, in the entire agri-food sector from the field and food industry to professional support, research and development to marketing, awareness and education.
KGZ comments on the parties' answers, saying that it is nice that the parties are also thinking about agriculture, as this is an important part of the solution for ensuring food security, but what will be written in the coalition agreement will be more important.
Customer responses:
Movement Freedom
The Svoboda Movement responds that they will promote sustainable and organic farming, as well as ecotourism and the use of new technologies on farms. Organic farming would be encouraged through higher support. They are convinced that Slovenian agriculture must be environmentally friendly, the use of natural resources must not have harmful consequences for the environment, agriculture needs new technologies in order to reduce the use of plant protection products, the use of fertilizers and water. Controls on the use of plant protection products need to be strengthened. Without bees there is no pollination, no food and no life. Additional support would be introduced for areas where honey plants are grown.
Left
According to them, the Left will advocate that the plan for organic farming will not be just a letter on paper: We will carry out all necessary activities to achieve the goal of increasing the share of organic agricultural land to 25% by 2030, they promise. Modernization and digitalisation in agriculture should serve to accelerate the transition to organic production and improve (productivity and efficiency) ecologically acceptable practices. In formulating the future agricultural policy, they will advocate the gradual replacement of hectare payments of basic income support with payments according to the equivalent of the work invested.
If we want to increase the scope of environmentally acceptable practices, in order to improve the state of the environment and produce healthy food, which usually requires more mechanical and manual processing, we must support work, not hectares, the Left believes. We would introduce food production planning through orders from public institutions, where by increasing the mandatory share of locally produced food and multi-year plans for planned guaranteed purchases, we would establish a stable and predictable environment for local residents. In addition, they will introduce financial and organizational incentives for planned mergers of small farmers, where merging into cooperative forms of integration would improve the potential of arable land and the accessibility and usability of small farms' production assets. We would stop advertising meat and dairy products and instead focus on promoting the consumption of plant foods and supporting quality schemes that actually contribute to strengthening local origin, quality and reducing negative environmental impacts.
LMS
LMŠ would slowly but surely increase the share of organic farming with financial incentives, subsidies, awareness raising and concrete projects aimed at organic farming. At the same time, public institutions would be encouraged to become direct consumers of organically produced agricultural products. Additional financial resources would be allocated to this - and how much will be assessed after a thorough analysis of the planned resources and the ability to use them in practice.
NSi
Nsi would supplement the existing guidelines for healthy eating by clearly stating that seasonal and locally grown food is of better quality and healthier, which has a positive effect on people's health and well-being. In public procurement, they will propose a simplification of the process of purchasing seasonal, locally and organically produced food. They will strive for effective control of mass flows and thus the origin of food. The challenge will be to implement the computerization of food safety, so that all information on the results of food safety and quality control will be available to the consumer.
They will increase funding for measures for transferors and for young farmers. Farmers need an adequate income position, they say, so they will propose an exemption from personal income tax for farmers from the income of agricultural activity in all OMD areas and the abolition of the health insurance contribution from supplementary activities on the farm. For farm owners who have very difficult working conditions and are far from urban centers, they will propose higher support, which, as they say, would ensure settlement and cultivation of the countryside. Effective and active management of wildlife and large carnivore populations needs to be ensured. Farmers, on the other hand, need quick and appropriate compensation for the damage. The stock of large carnivores and red deer must be returned to the state of the 1930s, they say. It is also necessary to promote the profession of farmer in kindergartens, schools and the general public, so that as many young people as possible choose this profession, they add.
Let's connect Slovenia
In Connect Slovenia, they say that the big challenge is how to attract new farms to organic farming, as the share of farms in conversion in 2010 was 36.5 percent and in 2020 only 9 percent. It is crucial for Connect Slovenia to achieve a higher share of organic farms (currently 5.4 percent) and at least 25 certified catering establishments (currently 14 establishments). They emphasized that over 300 million euros, which are spent annually on food in kindergartens, schools, hospitals, other public institutions, the army and other state institutions, should be given priority to food produced in Slovenia. Within the common agricultural policy, EUR 1,778,332,768 is available for Slovenia. At EU level, around 1.8% (€ 7.5 billion) of the CAP is currently earmarked for support for organic farming. They are convinced that Slovenia must also follow this trend. It is essential that we promote projects that create higher added value. If we continue with the steps of tax relief and debureaucratization, while ensuring a green and digital transition, our economy will work even better. They are convinced that the promotion of jobs in agriculture must follow this logic, as long-term sustainable agriculture is primarily an economy with potentially great added value and strategic importance for Slovenia and its self-sufficiency.
SAB
The SAB will pay the greatest attention to projects related to strengthening self-sufficiency and local and organic food production. According to them, Slovenia must become nutritionally and energy-independent and self-sufficient. Their actions will be aimed at achieving the following concrete goals: we must increase our own food production with incentives above 80 percent of self-sufficiency in vegetables, fruits and cereals, with at least 30 percent of these foods organically grown and meat and dairy products 100% self-sufficient.
SD
In SD, the increase in the share of organic farming would be tackled by incentives to strengthen strategic integration in agriculture and food to achieve competitiveness, environmental sustainability and by transforming the sector into a modern value chain with strong economic, social and ecological effects.
The preservation of smaller farms would be tackled by supporting areas with more difficult production conditions, such as hilly, mountainous, karst, steep, fragmented and border areas, through special measures so that they can compete with growers in more favorable conditions and, above all, encourage them to continue to grow food for themselves and sell the surplus, thus keeping the agricultural landscape alive. These farms contribute to the self-sufficiency of milk and meat, the preservation of cultivation, population and biodiversity. We would establish more tax-friendly legislation for farms up to 20 hectares which, in addition to their core business, carry out economic activities of local supply, tourism and hospitality and / or forestry manufacturing (flat-rate taxation).
They will strive to buy the Border Agricultural Land, which lies within 15 km of the state border and is for sale and published on a bulletin board, by the Agricultural Land and Forest Fund at comparable prices in the EU, they promise.
Investments in agricultural projects:
Here, the task of the state is to develop investments in infrastructure and programs. In line with the objectives of agricultural policy (higher added value and self-sufficiency), this should also be supported by investments, on the one hand in greater resilience to agriculture and weather conditions, and on the other in support of agriculture's transition to higher livelihoods and higher added values.
Regarding the advertising of local products, they will strive to have at least 60 percent of local food (meat, fruit, vegetables, fish, etc.) in public institutions and a larger share of food with a higher quality scheme. They will examine the possibility of establishing a single system for the use of locally grown food in kindergartens, schools and hospitals. Promotion of jobs in agriculture would be undertaken by encouraging the establishment of ""fair trade"" stores in all major cities in Slovenia while subsidizing for-profit rents for these stores.
Promotion and promotion of professions in the field of agriculture, forestry, food, fisheries, self-sufficiency, sustainability and environmental protection. Encouraging the transfer of farms to young entrepreneurs. Redesigning the current scheme to allow for more acquisitions of young farmers, while insuring older farmers who hand over farm management to younger generations, they added.
SDS
The SDS is advocating the largest possible production of local organic food, which travels from the field to the plate for the shortest time. Due to the short route, the food is guaranteed freshness, higher nutritional value and thus the quality of food, which means that this type of food has a higher added value and less impact on the environment.
The policy provides the basis for public procurement (over 120 million euros), proposes measures such as sales in public institutions as part of the national nutrition program, in schools as part of the curriculum, consumer awareness, promotes measures such as direct delivery from the farm (cooperative) to home, connecting consumers and producers and of course creates favorable conditions for farmers to eat as much as possible produced in this way. In short, legal regulations and technical solutions are needed, such as the introduction of amendments in e.g. school curriculum - Let's get to know the tastes of Slovenia (related to Slovenian food). All this affects the visibility and reputation of the agricultural profession, which is certainly the profession of the future. The main focus in agriculture should be, in addition to raising self-sufficiency, the promotion and financing of technologies or. measures to help manage negative weather conditions (sprinkling, irrigation systems, counter-current protection ...).

In Cankarjev dom, they discussed with several health experts the problems and solutions of the Slovenian health care system. The round table was connected by orthopedist Danijel Bešič Loredan, Golob's candidate for ministerial position, and there was no coronavirus-infected party president Robert Golob through a video link.","As reported in the 24UR show, the president of the Svoboda movement party, Robert Golob, whose health condition has slightly deteriorated today, says that it is not a handicap, but that the situation is really a bit unusual. The campaign will be completed without his presence, and it seems that he will not be at the headquarters on Sunday.
Well, critical of the current ""chaos"" in Slovenian health care, as some estimated, were various health experts at Cankarjev dom, including surgeon Erik Brecelj and orthopedist Danijel Bešič Loredan, who is counting on a ministerial position. In the discussion, he was supported by former Minister of Health Dorjan Marušič, who said that ""we live in a corrupt country and it would be utopian to imagine that corruption in health care will be zero"", but to get enough wind in the sails if managed to reduce it by at least 25 percent at the start.
According to the party, they will focus on the exit strategy for covid and comprehensive health care reform, with the aim of finding long-term solutions that will keep society free. The first ace up their sleeve, they predict, will be an intervention law to immediately shorten waiting times.
What other solutions do they suggest?
According to Mirta Koželj, a specialist in internal medicine, the Svoboda Movement would be one of the short-term measures to financially reward family doctors who exceed the headcount quotients. Family medicine clinics would relieve administrative workload and improve the information system. Among the long-term solutions, she listed an increase in enrollment at both medical faculties and the prevention of the departure of health care employees.
According to the doctor and former Minister of Health Dorijan Marušič, health workers in Slovenia are doing well, but the problem is that due to the longer waiting lists, many are waiting for a very long time for treatment.
Among other things, he advocates the introduction of better control over public health institutions. According to him, the ""policy"" is often ""reflected"" in the councils of health institutions, which should be withdrawn from health care, and the work of institutions should be monitored by supervisors.
Surgeon Erik Brecelj also agreed with this, emphasizing the importance of better organization of health care institutions. According to him, many problems in health care can be solved with small solutions, among them by promoting greater mutual respect between health professionals and better working conditions.
Nurse Aleksandra Lah Topolšek sees solutions in the immediate regulation of the salary system in nursing and the employment of additional staff. She also proposed the introduction of a special directorate in the Ministry of Health to take care of the field of nursing.
Rade Pribaković Brinovec from the National Institute of Public Health pointed out the increase in mental distress during the covida-19 epidemic. As a solution, he mentioned, among other things, the regulation of the field of specializations of clinical psychologists, which has only recently begun to be partially funded by the state.
Virologist Metka Paragi also touched on the epidemic. According to her, the poor results of the epidemic were caused by political interference in the work of the profession. She emphasized the importance of vaccination against covid-19 and other diseases, but took the view that vaccination should be voluntary."

""We must hope for the best, but we must be prepared for the worst,"" said the Social Democrat president, who presented the SD's action plan with a series of measures to protect Slovenia from the effects of the war in Ukraine.","“I am among the people every day. I’m talking to seniors who are worried about how they’ll pay for heating costs next season. I talk to families who see food and gasoline prices rising. I am talking to craftsmen and entrepreneurs who are facing high growth in raw material prices and great uncertainty, ”describes Tanja Fajon,“ unfavorable circumstances and high inflation (heating rose by 52%, food by 7% and petrol by 50%).
It draws attention to the warnings of domestic and foreign economists, warning of a protracted crisis due to high inflation, problems with the supply of raw materials and goods. In the midst of these circumstances, however, due to the policy of the current government, Slovenia is not in good shape.
Therefore, the SD expert council prepared an action plan with key questions: how will Slovenia be supplied with energy, raw materials, food and money.
Determination of the highest possible electricity prices
The Social Democrats are advocating temporary regulation of the electricity market by setting maximum allowable prices and re-regulating the market for motor fuels. They emphasize the need to use the mechanisms set out in the Price Control Act to stabilize energy and electricity prices. A step towards this is also the freezing of VAT on energy and motor fuels and a temporary sliding reduction in excise duties.
Assistance to companies in purchasing raw materials
Due to bottlenecks in supply chains, many companies are facing a shortage of raw materials, which has risen sharply. To help companies become more resilient and easier to adapt to new conditions and maintain production, business and jobs, the Social Democrats are planning a rescue package to help the economy worth 1.5 billion euros. In doing so, they have a simple system in place so that bureaucratic complications do not recur during epidemics, when the state invented meaningless criteria and demanded the return of aid.
For micro and small enterprises, they plan interest-free loans with a state guarantee through the state website with a two-day transfer and a repayment period of up to 5 years, while medium and large companies would receive interest-free loans up to 10% of annual turnover with 80% state guarantee. To improve the liquidity of companies, they envisage the possibility of postponing the payment of VAT for a period of one year.
Price control also throughout the food chain
Ukraine is an important exporter of food and food raw materials, which is why some countries have already restricted or banned food exports. The Social Democrats are proposing price controls throughout the food chain, as there is always a danger in crisis situations that margins will increase at the same time as raw materials, making the product even more expensive.
According to the Social Democrats, it is also necessary to monitor the strategic raw materials needed by farmers, such as energy sources, fertilizers and seeds. With prices rising sharply, the state must subsidize prices.
At the same time, SD advocates the priority purchase of food produced in Slovenia and the restriction of exports. Maximum activation of agricultural land now also needs to be urgently addressed.
How to make money?
The aggravated situation will require money. Therefore, the SD proposes intervention measures to ensure the liquidity of the state in the next 24 months in the event of a significant deterioration in the international financial markets. However, a different investment policy is needed, which will multiply development funds and attract additional resources, for example from the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Together with other measures, the Social Democrats want to quickly increase Slovenia's resilience so that it can protect its people and economy from the consequences of the war in Ukraine and the changed circumstances in the international economic environment.
SD is best prepared to lead Slovenia
The action plan was prepared by the SD because Tanja Fajon wants to be ready to accept the necessary solutions from the first day after the elections. According to her, with a wide team of experts and a plan for major changes, the Social Democrats are the best prepared choice for leading Slovenia in difficult times.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/na-cetrtem-soocenju-o-gospodarstvu-placah-nepremicninah-in-davkih.html,The fourth confrontation is marked by verbal duels,"At the fourth pre-election confrontation, all leaders of political parties answered the questions of Uroš Slak, to whom public opinion polls predict the most votes and the possibility of being included in the National Assembly. Due to the coronavirus infection, the president of the Freedom Movement party, Robert Golob, participated via video link. The guests talked about economic topics, while getting involved in several verbal duels.","The decisive week before the elections is ahead of us, and according to the latest opinion polls, SDS President Janez Janša and Svoboda Movement President Robert Golob are fighting for victory. Both of them also took part in the fourth pre-election confrontation on our television, but this time Golob participated in the confrontation via video link due to infection with a new coronavirus.
Leaders of other political parties also took part in the confrontation: Tanja Fajon (SD), Luka Mesec (Left), Marjan Šarec (LMŠ), Matej Tonin (NSi), Alenka Bratušek (SAB) and Zdravko Počivalšek (Connect Slovenia). The composition of the government will also be decided by smaller political parties.
Recent opinion polls suggest that Robert Golob's Svoboda party has overtaken the SDS. ""If it weren't for him, he would be someone else,"" SDS leader Janez Jansa commented, explaining that ""some new or recycled face has always appeared in the 2008 elections."" “If I could decide on that and work on a priority list, Golob would be very high,” he added. He also wished the pigeon a speedy recovery.
Golob, meanwhile, believes the new faces are a chewed-up topic. ""I myself had no desire to go into politics, but in the end I realized that there is no one else and that I have no choice. If I want us to live in a free and open society, I have to accept it as a challenge,"" he said.
""For NSi, the first priority is to form a center-right government, which has proven to be the best so far,"" said Matej Tonin, adding that after the elections they are ready to form a coalition with Golob, but the Left will not be in power. ""It is in Slovenia's interest that the Left does not join the next government, as their program is harmful,"" he said.
""There are at least five of us on the show tonight with whom we could form a government,"" said Tanja Fajon, listing the parties of the KUL coalition and the Freedom Movement.
Regarding his departure from Gen-I, Golob said that he knew in February last year that a change would follow, as announced by Bojan Požar. ""Then members close to the SDS offered to urge, but I didn't believe them. They believed that honesty still reigned in the SDS party and that there were arguments to convince the party that it was doing the wrong side. I didn't believe them and I was preparing for the whole year. So we entered the scene ready, ""he said.
""We will work with everyone who is ready to look to the future,"" Počivalšek said. ""I hope that people will believe us. I believe that voters will be able to reward those who build,"" he said, emphasizing that they have proven their success many times. ""The country is in the best shape since independence today,"" he said. ""Whoever wins will need partners,"" Šarec said, adding that it was necessary to return to the constitutional path, where the rules for ministers and ""ordinary"" citizens would be the same.
""The SAB will be a strong part of the center-left coalition,"" Bratuskova said, adding that they would also be the voice of retirees. She added that they are a brave and reliable team that knows how to solve problems. ""Even now we are in big trouble, the new government has a lot of work to do. We are not afraid of that and we know public finances well. As we already have, we will fix these things this time as well,"" she is clear.
""When you threw the rifle into the corn, when it was clear that the coronavirus would also come to Slovenia, we invited you to join the coalition, but you did not accept that,"" Janša said.
""This government is reminiscent of the sinking Titanic. This government is acting very irresponsibly and talking about giving to everyone, but in the end it is just allocating money. We will have to give it all back,"" Šarec was critical. ""If it were as nice as the government gentlemen say, we would have Umar's proposal approved today. Why don't we have it? Because otherwise we would have a big hole in the state coffers. There is already a five billion hole in our budget. You are about 500 million euros short. , ""Bratuškova also agreed.
To Tonin's words to allow the center-right government to continue its good work, Bratušek replied: ""If we want to bury Slovenia.""
The question of nationalization
Ever since the entry of the Left into politics and the statements of MP Kordiš, the issue of nationalization, which is written in their program, has been on the air. ""We will transfer the ownership of companies to the state and local communities and establish workers', farmers' and consumers' cooperatives. /.../ Agricultural land will be able to remain privately owned, but not to the extent of large estates,"" the program reads. This program was not supported by any other party in the studio. The month, however, said that this part of the program will not be set as a condition for cooperation with Golob.
Šarec described the debates on nationalization as fruitless. ""There is no responsible politician to support nationalization,"" he said, but praised the co-ownership system. ""Co-ownership cannot be forced, but we must encourage them to do so,"" he said.
“By no means do I agree with leaving the center-right government,” Golob stressed. He said that we still have a lot of unused money in Slovenia. He pointed out that the best way to keep good workers in a company is through housing or co-ownership. ""However, it must be legally regulated so that entry must be more and exit less favorable. In this way, we can best encourage employees because they know who they work for. For themselves,"" he said.
Rest: The state is similar to a company, people will have to decide who to trust
Počivalšek points out that the situation in Slovenia is good, regardless of the fact that two years of health crisis are behind us. He also emphasizes that the state is similar to a company: ""Slovenians will have to decide who they will give the opportunity to run the country.""
The month dedicated a replica to Janša. ""You are saying that we are looking back at Austria and Germany because of the Left's experiment. We are looking back at them because of tycoons, pouring money abroad and much more,"" he said. But Janša did not agree with him. ""When you talk about tycoons, are you talking about Mr. Kordez?"" he passed the ball to Mescu, who mentioned Bavčar, who is writing off his debts, and others. “Procedures have been canceled under your government,” Moon was critical.
""We have record low unemployment, we have good employment, we have people who can pay taxes, they save - we have to put this capital into assets. Here I agree with Golob,"" Janša said.
Fajonova both complained about the ""duel"" between Mesec and Janša. She emphasized that not everything is so good in Slovenia, as there are too many people who do not reach the minimum wage and live below the poverty line. “There are big inequalities in society,” she said.
They want to progressively tax capital, adds Fajonova: ""In this way, we could bring a billion into the state treasury, which could also abolish supplementary health insurance.""
Počivalšek is critical that the Social Democrats cannot yet regulate their party finances. ""We need not only muscles, but also brains. We support the income tax law and in Slovenia we want to retain professional staff who go abroad. We are competitive at lower wages, and completely uncompetitive with the environment at higher wages,"" he said.
""Labor is absolutely too burdensome, and capital would be taxed according to OECD guidelines,"" Šarec said. ""At least 250 million euros are missing,"" said Bratuškova, who said they would not allow people to have their pensions reduced. ""It is good that we have economic growth and low unemployment. But the same data was used in 2008, and we know where Slovenia later landed.""
""Slovenia will agree to such a point again next year if you take over the government,"" Janša replied, stressing that they had borrowed at ""extremely low"" interest rates.
A pigeon would tax property more, not just real estate. “It’s right that the one who has, also gives more,” he said. In Janša's words, he said that he wanted to raise added value per employee. He emphasizes that higher employment and low unemployment are not enough. ""It will be necessary to start an extremely strong investment cycle in digital and green, otherwise we will not be able to patch the holes,"" he said.
The next confrontation will be broadcast on Friday, April 22, also starting at 8 pm on POP TV.
Tax policy of Slovenia
""Wages are too taxed in Slovenia, so the race for the minimum wage has developed. We must all work together to keep wages as high as possible,"" Tonin said, stressing how important it is to keep good staff in the country.
""We are advocating a progressive tax policy. We need to watch out for the extraordinary social disparities that are currently emerging,"" Fajonova said.
Počivalšek does not agree with her. ""Added value has increased in Slovenia. Our added value is once more than in Croatia and twice as much as in Serbia. But we want to halve the gap with Austria. We want to relieve employers of the burden so that they can give more to workers. We took the first step with the tax law. we also need to take the second step, ”he says.
According to Počivalšek, Golob said that Slovenia's goal should not be to halve the gap with Austria. ""The goal should be to catch Austria through green and digital jobs,"" he said, adding: ""The path you cite is the path of eternal slaves."" Počivalšek replied that falsification was not enough and pointed out that a lot had been done in this government. The pigeon then felt they were investing in the wrong things.
As a problem, Janša pointed out that Ljubljana generates more jobs than the able-bodied population. Most of the investments still remain in Ljubljana, he emphasized. ""Only this government has redistributed investments throughout Slovenia. This will increase added value in the future,"" he said.
The most vulnerable must be taken care of first - those below the minimum wage threshold, Golob is clear. ""We need to make sure we all have a decent life and that those who can give more will give it away."" Commenting on the sale of electricity: ""We started to create added value when we made changes, when we put green energy at the top of the company. That's when people started coming to work because of the mission,"" he said.
""One is words and the other is deeds. Under the Income Tax Act, individuals will have higher salaries at the end of the year,"" Tonin said, criticizing the opposition, which is blocking the law. They also suggested that unemployed persons should accept a job lower than their education after three months at the employment office, and two levels after six months, he added. ""Well, I beg you. Now we will educate people, and then we will give them work for half as much as they were educated,"" Moon did not agree with Tonin.
""Administrative salary increases are not a solution that can be worked on indefinitely. We need to change that,"" said Šarec, describing Tonin's words as platitudes. ""It must be said that during our government, more money flowed into the state coffers compared to Šarč's government, we did it by leaving more people in our pockets,"" Tonin replied. Šarec is critical, however, that they only relieved the best paid.
""People have to work. We let entrepreneurs work, they know best how to work with their companies. We need more Akrapovičs, Boscarols and Czechs,"" Počivalšek said. ""This government has done nothing for the economy, you have made a real mess of public sector wages. This is the first thing that the new government will have to urgently rehabilitate,"" Bratuskova said, adding that they had passed such laws that would not be boldly accept.
The impact of the war in Ukraine on the Slovenian economy
Will Golob freeze the prices of petroleum products, just like the current government? ""Oil prices have partially calmed down at the moment. It is much worse in the field of natural gas, and slightly better in the field of electricity. Therefore, the natural gas market will have to be intervened,"" he said. He emphasizes that we have enough electricity produced in Slovenia, and that the state must therefore regulate prices for everyone in this area as well.
That farmers need to be helped in times of crisis, but that they need to be helped by not having to stockpile, he said. “Then we need to get to the next sectors along the entire food chain as well,” he added. He emphasizes that everything is not only on the government and consumers, but also on the shoulders of traders. We need to start talking to them, he said, stressing that they too must take some responsibility.
Janša emphasized that Golob did not list solutions in his speech. ""The European Union is putting a lot of effort into joint purchases, which would make them cheaper, and into joint transports. Things will stabilize, but we will have to make further efforts,"" he said. But it ensures that no one will get cold in the fall and that no one will be in the dark.
Fajonova says they have proposed a rescue package on how to help the economy in the food sector as well. ""We have presented a long action plan to mitigate the effects of the crisis in Ukraine,"" she said.
""Our government is working hard to calm things down in this area. Our ministers are going to meetings where they want to provide compensation for Russian energy. Our government has laid a good foundation,"" Tonin said.
Bratušek, meanwhile, emphasized that there were many retirees in Slovenia who were cold this winter. “Because you reacted too late,” she said. ""When I was Minister of Infrastructure, we started talking to Croatia. We wanted to diversify resources, but you laughed at me. We should continue our work immediately, not wait for it to burn under our feet,"" she said.
""Dependence on fossil fuels is not the solution. Our future is wind, sun and water. But it takes time. We also need to take care of another nuclear power plant,"" Počivalšek said, adding that they acted as soon as they could.
Šarec, meanwhile, agrees with the regulation of network charges. “The current situation should not last long,” he stressed. He also added that the national resilience plan needs to be revised and that the resources we have at our disposal, such as biomass, need to be used.
""A decree has been prepared to regulate the prices of basic consumer goods, which will be adopted in the coming days if prices rise,"" Janša said.
What will change after April 24?
""We need to alleviate the crisis and help the people. We will advocate self-sufficiency and help for farmers, including the purchase of crops. Energy mitigation and anti-poverty measures. ""In the medium term, we need to get rid of fossil fuels. By 2030, Slovenia will have to have clear priorities,"" Mesec said.
""People will have an interesting choice on April 24. They can choose parties that turn to the past, or they can choose parties that have shown something. We will try to find a common denominator. Only together can we win,"" he said. Tonin. Among other things, he said they will ensure accessible public health. “We’re going to go into the Swiss, Austrian, German model,” he said.
""At the first session of the government, we will first appoint a state secretary to reduce waiting times in health care. Our priority is this. Then we will support the Institute's proposal on March 8, we will also focus on public RTV. .
""We will continue to provide Slovenia with security, stability and development,"" Jansa said. He pointed out that there are many projects underway that will make this possible and are already underway. ""Other parts of Slovenia must also join Ljubljana. We are already working on that. We are no longer laboratories for experiments,"" he said.
The pigeon pointed out two things. ""We will not wait for the government to form to support civil society. In the summer we will talk mainly about how to avoid a new corona crisis,"" he said, stressing that he did not want to talk about curfews, mandatory masks in schools or compulsory vaccination. However, he emphasized the need to protect the most vulnerable part of society.
""Slovenia will be strong only as much as its economy is strong. We will flatten taxes for craftsmen, caterers and farmers,"" Počivalšek said.
""Our most short-term goal is to replace this harmful government on April 24. The main challenges are to regulate public finances, regulate health issues and, perhaps most importantly for the SAB, take care of retirees,"" Bratuskova said.

Clashes continue in the port city of Mariupol. It was in this city that Russian forces also captured British soldier Aidn Aslin, and now another British soldier, Shaun Pinner, has appeared on Russian television. Both captured soldiers asked Ukraine and Great Britain on television to carry out an exchange of prisoners with Russia. They called for an exchange with pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk. The families of the captured Britons, meanwhile, stress that the soldiers are not ""foreign mercenaries"" and must therefore be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention.","During the attacks on the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, Russian forces captured a large number of soldiers fighting the occupiers there. Among them is the British Aiden Aslin, who moved to Ukraine in 2018 out of love and joined the Ukrainian army. After the start of the war on February 24, he also took up arms in the conflict against Russia.
Already last week, Russian media published photos and an interview with Aslin, which was captured after his unit surrendered to the Russian army. His family was horrified at the sight of the beaten Briton, but at the same time grateful that they had reported that the soldier was still alive. Another British soldier, Shaun Pinner, has now appeared on Russian state television alongside Aslin.
Both British fighters have asked to be replaced by pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk. The latter landed in the hands of Ukrainian authorities last week. At the time of his arrest, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky proposed changing the policy for prisoners of war held by Moscow forces.
Both Aslin and Pinner appeared separately on television, and also sent a message to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who asked him to help bring them home.
Like Aslin, Pinner is captured in Mariupol
Another British soldier, confirmed to have been captured by Russian forces, was visibly tired in the footage. He said he was also caught in Mariupol, where he was fighting Ukrainian marines. The 48-year-old fought there for five or six weeks, Sky News reports.
Pinner, who hails from Bedfordshire, UK, said in an edited video that they were ordered to relocate from the factory area in the early hours of Tuesday. They left the factory around 4am but did not know where they were going, he added: ""There wasn't much time to think."" A Russian journalist, meanwhile, told the Briton in a video that Ukrainian commanders want to kill him.
As early as January, a British soldier spoke to the British media about the fear of Russian capture. ""I fear for my life. If we are caught, the Russians will treat us differently because we are British,"" he said at the time.
The families of the two captured British soldiers, meanwhile, stress that the British are not mercenaries, as Moscow claims, and that they should therefore be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention. ""Shaun was a highly regarded soldier in the British Army who served in the Royal Regiment for many years. He also served in the Northern Ireland area and at the United Nations in Bosnia, among others,"" the Pinner family said. As they said, in 2018 he decided to move to Ukraine, where he wanted to use his experience within the Ukrainian army. During this time he was promoted among the Ukrainian Marines.
""Shaun has enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life. For the past four years, he has considered Ukraine his adopted country,"" they said. In Ukraine, meanwhile, he also met his wife. The statement stressed that Pinner is not a volunteer or mercenary, but that he also officially serves the Ukrainian army in accordance with Ukrainian law.
After the publication of the interview with Aslin, the soldier's grandmother also spoke, describing the video as ""Russian propaganda"". Aslin's mother, Angela Wood, meanwhile, made the same statement as Pinner's family. She emphasized that Aslin was not a British mercenary. ""He has been in Ukraine for four years and is a legitimate Ukrainian Marine,"" she said.
Medvedchuk also asked in the video for a replacement with soldiers and civilians from Mariupol
Ukrainian security forces also shared their footage with the public. It was attended by the pro-Russian politician Medvedchuk, who himself called for the exchange of prisoners of war. He asked to be replaced by soldiers and civilians from Mariupol.
The oligarch, who is suspected of treason, escaped from house arrest on February 27. The court ordered his house arrest in two criminal cases, namely for irregularities in oil and gas production in the Black Sea and for supporting the activities of a terrorist organization that allegedly helped it by supplying coal from the temporarily occupied territories of Donbas. The captured politician is the leader of the Opposition Platform - For Life party and is an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
""I find it particularly cynical that he tried to escape in the uniform of the Ukrainian army. He tried to disguise himself. What a soldier. What a patriot,"" Zelensky said after Medvedchuk's arrest. He added: ""If Medvedchuk decides to wear a military uniform, then the rules of war apply to him."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/izumiranje-periferije-kako-bodo-stranke-dosegle-decentralizacijo-drzave.html,Extinction of the periphery. How will the parties achieve decentralization of the state?,"Slovenian politics has been talking about decentralization since at least the beginning of the century, but nevertheless its operation and chronic dissent give the least ""silence"" to the reverse process - centralization. While the life potential of the periphery continues to shrink steadily, the pressure on Ljubljana is increasing, raising living costs in the capital vertically, increasing the burden on public services, and the daily migration of more than 130,000 workers is a major transport challenge. We offered political parties the opportunity to articulate concrete solutions for the decentralization of Slovenia.","The capital Ljubljana, where the growing service sector is concentrated, offers by far the most employment opportunities in the country. In many peripheral places, this triggered an exodus, especially among young people who decided to stay in the capital after graduation or moved there, soon after realizing that they would not be able to become economically independent in their hometown.
To this must be added the mass daily migrations of the buzzing tin towards the center of the country. According to the Statistical Office for 2020, Ljubljana is by far the most burdened by migration in both directions. 134,100 people from other municipalities come to work every day out of a total of almost 870,000 people in employment. About six times fewer people leave the city every day (22,800). Moreover, according to data from 2019, as many as 26 percent of jobs in Ljubljana were in the country, and the trend was already increasing. For comparison, in Maribor only seven percent.
At the end of 2020, every second person in employment in Slovenia went to work in another municipality, and the share of daily labor migrants has been increasing for many years. These data in the narrowest sense indicate a high labor mobility of the population.
The prosperity of Ljubljana is also directly related to the extinction of the periphery and the concentration of political, economic and cultural power. The suburbs have been suffering from brain drain for many years, and some places have serious demographic problems. With the abolition of jobs, emigration increased, and smaller cities began to lose their urban potential, gained mainly in the second half of the last century. There is a cessation of theft, loss of capital and irritation of public services, which further accelerates emigration with lower wages.

The Osrednjeslovenska statistical region has 31.4 percent more jobs than the working population.
However, Ljubljana is also experiencing a unique bumblebee effect. No one seems to be able to tame the enraged real estate market as housing prices continue to rise. The character of the city and its demographics are changing so irresistibly, as people with ordinary salaries find it increasingly difficult to afford to buy real estate and live in the capital. In addition, there are a number of traffic and other problems that the city's congestion brings.
Therefore, at least every other employed person in Slovenia who drives to another municipality every working day is personally aware of the problem. What are the solutions and how will political decision-makers address them in the next term?
Freedom Movement: Establishment of Regions and Deployment of State Institutions
They have many plans and promises in the Freedom Movement. They are committed to ""polycentric regional development and development spatial policy"". In their opinion, Slovenia must develop t. i. smart communities, where a sustainable living concept would be achieved while respecting economic, ecological and social sustainability. The party promises to work for the development of ""quality infrastructure"" across the country and to promote employment in rural areas. ""Digital technology planning will play a role in rural areas in the future."" They are announcing the preparation of comprehensive plans for the revitalization and smart economic specialization of cities lagging behind in development.
The Svoboda Movement also announces the acceleration of the establishment of regions, the directing of European funds to endangered border areas and the countryside, and the elimination of development delays through the implementation of key regional and local projects. In doing so, they rely on public-private partnerships and social entrepreneurship. Thus, they are supposed to provide basic services in the countryside, such as post offices, banks, shops, etc. They also announce the return of knowledge institutions to less developed regions, the regulation of subsidies for the renovation of older houses in rural areas and the opportunity for young people to use the housing stock.
""The decentralization of the capital will also be helped by modern public transport infrastructure (with an emphasis on railway infrastructure), which needs to be modernized to such an extent that life in the capital will no longer be a necessity."" The General Assembly is convinced that one of the measures to achieve polycentric development of the country is the distribution of individual institutions throughout Slovenia. They have in mind, for example, the National Council and the Ombudsman. ""Such a measure could be a step towards reducing development disparities between Slovenian regions and municipalities, providing equal opportunities for access to public services in these institutions, etc.,"" they wrote in the reply.
Left: Public transport, public housing and public services
According to the Left Party, the key measures to achieve decentralization are the provision of public, fast and efficient public transport, the provision of public, affordable and non-profit housing, the provision of all necessary public services in the local environment (education, health, infrastructure, cultural and sports facilities…). and public investment in the decentralized economic development of the country. ""If all the above measures were taken, young people would not feel the need to move to the capital, but would have a lot of reasons to live outside it,"" they estimate.
LMŠ: Support for the migration of young people to the countryside
The LMŠ also advocates the establishment of regions. They would transfer certain competencies of the state to them, and thus also strengthen regional development and inter-municipal cooperation and reduce the pressure on the capital. They strive to maintain the population of the entire country by strengthening the development power of the regions and reducing disparities.
It is also important, according to the LMŠ, that the state helps to decentralize the state by effectively managing its real property by moving the seats of individual state bodies and institutions to areas where the state has the appropriate capacity to do so. ""An additional solution, which is not talked about enough, is to support the migration of young people to rural areas by creating self-sufficient sustainable villages and new jobs in rural areas and by strengthening intergenerational cooperation, including through the EU's common agricultural policy.""
NSi: Work from home, road, rail and public transport
In Nova Slovenija, they are committed to harmonious regional development. According to them, ensuring adequate road and rail connectivity, public transport and broadband internet access is also crucial in rural areas. ""It will also be necessary to simplify the conditions for working from home, which may make it easier for employees to decide to stay in the countryside.""
Improving the conditions for farming and tourism can also make an important contribution to rural settlement, they point out. The party also emphasizes the importance of a favorable business environment, which enables the creation of jobs throughout the country. ""The current government has also shown a lot of understanding for the needs of municipalities, and we want to continue this policy.""
Connecting Slovenia: Strengthening the housing stock, public-private partnerships and good local practices
""We must enable young people to solve their housing problem on their own. The situation on the real estate market is somewhat distorted due to the centralization process. Our answer is regionalization and creating appropriate conditions throughout Slovenia. If we are effective in decentralization, the price will fall,"" he said. considered in the party.
However, they agree that more money should be spent on solving housing problems, especially for those who are facing it for the first time. ""We will act in three directions here: we will strengthen the housing fund with guarantee schemes, make better use of the potential of public-private partnerships and promote existing good practices at the local level."" In doing so, they refer to the ‘Kobarid model’ and ‘other good practices’.
SAB: Administrative decentralization and efficient intercity passenger transport
The party emphasizes that administrative decentralization is also needed for concrete decentralization, ""as this affects employment opportunities in other places, not only in Ljubljana"". ""We also believe that the state's guarantee scheme could be adjusted to make the purchase of real estate in rural areas more affordable."" All of the above is, of course, related to efficient long-distance passenger transport, so the party will work on the introduction of free public transport for young people, following the example of the red card for pensioners.
SD: Better governance at local level, regional centers and coherent development
The party is in favor of harmonious urban and regional development, for which, in their opinion, Slovenia needs a new regional and urban policy. Therefore, they predict a strengthening of the incentive for the development of all regions, the implementation of the concept of smart cities, villages and communities. ""We believe that the potential for higher quality public services and more balanced regional development is important in the establishment of regions, so we will revive the debate on the establishment of provinces by producing a Green Paper on regions, identifying different scenarios for establishing regions.""
SD also announces the transfer of the seat of state institutions to other Slovenian cities, and the re-evaluation of the tasks of municipalities, ""according to the functions they actually perform"". They also mention the role of cities as regional centers, the position of border municipalities and the interconnection of municipalities.
""We will strive to deepen the dialogue between political stakeholders, local communities and in the regions on possible scenarios for the development of regional self-government and establish a permanent and stable multiannual financial framework for financing regions and municipalities for better development planning and local governance,"" they said.
SDS: Housing construction across the country and infrastructure development
According to the SDS, moving young people to Ljubljana is not a good solution. They emphasize that development must include the whole of Slovenia and provide development opportunities to municipalities, towns and villages further away from the center.
""Apart from the construction of housing throughout the country and the development of infrastructure, the relocation of state institutions and regionalization are important measures that will preserve and encourage settlement outside the centers, thus preserving jobs and reducing the gap."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/stranke-na-stanovanja.html,Where would the parties settle the young people? How would you regulate the rental market?,"Undoubtedly, one of the most pressing problems in Slovenia is the inaccessibility of housing for young people. “The existing housing system is inefficient and unfair,” warn the Institute for Housing and Spatial Studies. People are also required to pay 1,000 euros a month in rent, and they cannot get a loan from the bank for the same monthly installment. We asked the eight political parties that seemed to be the best at the beginning of our election project to find out how they will permanently solve the housing issue and how they will regulate the rental market.","The share of those who pay more than a third of their income for housing costs is due to the growing gap between the slow growth of wages and the dizzying rise in house purchase prices. rents are increasing year by year, warn the Institute for Housing and Spatial Studies. Residential property prices rose nearly 16 percent year-on-year in 2021, while wages rose about five percent. ""Such discrepancies between the growth of the former and the latter are nothing new,"" they say, adding that the growing problem is clear from the increase in the number of applicants and beneficiaries for nonprofit housing, while public housing funds on average manage to solve the housing problem. 11 percent of beneficiaries.
According to the institute, the problem stems from the absence of an active role of the state and the virtually complete transfer of housing supply to the market. ""This has led us to a lack of building enough housing, an aging and dilapidated housing stock, unsustainable growth in purchase prices, a small, oversaturated, unregulated and uncontrolled rental market that demands too high rents for poor quality living and short-term rent.""
Speculative capital is also a problem
In addition to the withdrawal of the state from the field of housing, the unbearable situation, on the other hand, is further fueled by the arrival of speculative capital, the institute is convinced. While most cannot find suitable housing (whether by renting or buying), some own more and more housing (including a few dozen apartments), which provides them with a safe haven for their capital and, increasingly, an extremely profitable investment. The growth of housing prices can be compared to the growth of stock markets, ""they point out.
The results of all this are that young people have no choice but to stay with their parents, to share an apartment or even a room, to buy smaller and smaller apartments (usually with the help of parents), and for families of four to live on 50 m2. ""At the same time, Slovenia has low housing mobility, we do not have enough suitable housing for the elderly, who often live in oversized real estate that they cannot afford to maintain, often even heat, apartments on the 4th floor without elevator, invisible and cut off from society,"" they warn.
Housing issues should be addressed holistically, and housing policy should not be seen as a social corrective for the most vulnerable parts of society (as has been done since independence), but as a basic development policy that is the basis for a healthy society - adequate housing it is the basis for integration into society, for personal and social development and therefore for quality education and the economy, for health. How we organize housing is and will be crucial for environmental protection.
The current government in action with the Housing Guarantee Scheme for Youth Act, many critical
Less than a month before the elections, the current government also tackled housing. On April 6, the National Assembly approved the law on the housing guarantee scheme for young people, prepared by coalition deputies, with 53 votes in favor and none against. The parliamentary groups agreed that young people should be helped, but part of the opposition believed that the law was vague and part of the pre-election propaganda. Among the critics of the guarantee scheme is also the Institute for the Study of Housing and Spatial Planning, which pointed out that even the European Parliament warns against such measures. The 2020 report cites such measures as a fundamental example of a flawed housing policy, they say.
According to the institute, the negative consequences of state guarantees for housing loans are also highlighted by recent scientific studies examining, for example, German and Croatian failed measures that led to a further rise in house prices due to medium-term increase in demand and extremely limited supply.
Among other things, it should also contribute to poorer quality of construction and further reduction of square footage (because investors will try to further reduce construction costs due to the upper limit on the value of the loan); dispersed construction (as young people will be forced to build mainly on new land or buy old housing in less desirable / more remote locations); and additional stratification (also through the exclusion of young singles and precarious employees). They also pointed out the dispersed public housing fund (which will be created as a result of the execution of mortgages and will be extremely difficult to maintain permanently) and additional unforeseen burdens on the state budget.
""However, it turned out that the law will not be able to lead to the above-mentioned negative effects, as banks guarantee that the law will not have a significant impact on expanding the circle of households that can get credit,"" the institute said. that, in the opinion of the Association of Banks, the law will not expand the circle of credit beneficiaries, which is the central purpose of the law.
""Regardless of the outcome of the election, cooperation with NGOs and experts will be important.""
The institute also points out that cooperation with non-governmental organizations and experts will be very important for the new government. ""By ignoring the housing sector, the state has lost most of its experts,"" the institute said, noting that care should be taken not to focus on the interests of capital, but of the interests of citizens, citizens and society as well. whole. As they pointed out, we already have many positive examples in the immediate vicinity, pointing out Vienna (comprehensive policy) and Zurich (housing cooperatives) as examples.
""No matter who takes power after the election, he will not be able to ignore some urgent measures - regardless of political beliefs,"" they said. These are:
- Progressive real estate tax or progressive property tax. According to the institute, this would be the only mechanism that can mitigate speculative purchases and at the same time provide a direct source for financing public housing (Slovenia, as one of the few countries, does not invest directly in the construction of public housing).
- Significant increase in the construction of public rental housing throughout Slovenia, which will not be possible without budgetary resources. They say that in the long run, over a period of several terms, they should target a minimum of 20 to 30% share of public rental housing. ""Only in this way will we be able to effectively regulate the situation in the housing field. In the long run, we must therefore provide 136,000 to 204,000 flats,"" they explain.
- Ensure complementarity with public housing through support for non-profit (or low-profit) housing organizations that can bring additional affordable housing to market. “Especially here, housing cooperatives are offered as a highly recognized and desirable form,” they say.
- Introduce stronger regulation and control over the rental market. According to them, this is primarily a necessary short-term measure, which can quickly improve the conditions in which tenants of market housing live, and at the same time stop or at least slow down the growth of rents.
We also asked them how the parties would address housing issues. You can read their answers below.
For a series of pre-election articles, our questions were answered by eight political parties that showed the best results at the beginning of our election project. Their answers are arranged alphabetically.
Freedom Movement: We will build a system of public financing for the construction of non-profit housing
To be aware of the lack of stable and high enough resources to finance the construction of public rental housing, say in the party Movement Freedom. ""Therefore, we will build a robust system of public financing of such projects or prepare the legal basis for the issuance of special-purpose bonds, which will be intended for the construction of public non-profit housing,"" they promise.
In addition, they support alternative and innovative housing communities. ""We will adopt a legal basis that will enable the construction of housing through housing cooperatives. We will also provide support and non-refundable EU funds for the pilot project of an intergenerational rental housing cooperative,"" they say.
In addition, they plan to set up an ""appropriate guarantee scheme for repayable and non-repayable funds for housing cooperatives"". ""We will also provide a guarantee scheme for young people or state guarantees for a loan for the purchase of their first apartment. This will make it easier for young people to meet the creditworthiness of the Bank of Slovenia,"" they wrote.
Left: Providing suitable housing for all is the task of the state
In the Left, they are very critical of the current state of housing policy and the construction of public rental housing. They point out that housing prices and market rents are among the highest in Europe in terms of the purchasing power of the population, and they are particularly angry that housing is increasingly being transformed into ""investments that only the rich can afford"". They are critical of the mass construction of luxury housing, which is intended for ""short-term rental to tourists via online platforms or remains completely empty and serves only to park the money of those who have more than they need.""
As they say, housing for the Left is home, a basic social infrastructure that should be dedicated to housing and social security of all citizens. ""But they're currently turning to private investment for the rich instead: according to some real estate agents, 30 percent of all real estate purchases today are investment.""
They point out that the increase in demand for investment property leads to a vicious circle of stratification based on new ""business opportunities"" for a handful of the richest and the complete exclusion of a growing population from the housing market. ""For the growing number of young people, there are only two options: paying astronomical rents or lifelong repayment of usurious loans. Investors are whistling at them, as they are increasingly targeting wealthier buyers who want to buy real estate as an investment. housing and, as a result, other real estate is being built less, and land prices are also rising, ""they are convinced. At the same time, in their opinion, high real estate prices and gentrification of urban cores are also causing migration to the outskirts of large cities and further to the countryside. ""This is putting pressure on rural areas to build up agricultural land, especially the highest quality ones. The solution to the housing issue must no longer be left to the elements of the market. Providing suitable housing for all is the task of the state.""
To get out of the vicious circle, you must immediately: 1. provide funding for the construction of 30,000 new public non-profit housing by 2030.2. strengthen the regulation of the rental market by limiting the amount of market rents; to support the development of housing cooperatives and other non-profit housing organizations that pursue the public interest in the field of housing.
LMŠ also regulates short-term leases through airbnb and booking platforms
The LMŠ party believes that real estate prices are also rising due to deposits on deposits. The program therefore pays special attention to those who cannot or cannot afford their own apartment. We have already reported several times on the seriousness of the housing problem, as people are required to pay 1,000 euros a month in rent, and the bank cannot get a loan for the same monthly installment. ""Precisely because of the cases you cite, we are announcing support for public-private partnerships to strengthen the fund of public rental housing and the establishment of a public rental service to activate the now vacant housing,"" they say at LMŠ. They are convinced that such rents would be reduced. ""Increasing the fund of public rental housing would also lead to a reduction in the amount of other rents.""
The program proposes the possibility of acquiring the first owner-occupied apartment by paying rent and establishing housing cooperatives on the model of successful foreign forms. “A step towards liberalizing the real estate rental market will be the regulation of short-term leases in multi-apartment buildings through the airbnb and booking platforms, and for students an increase in capacity in dormitories,” they say.
But they also have a solution for the financial side of the listed solutions. The population, which has more than 24 billion deposits in banks, will be encouraged to activate them voluntarily by issuing dedicated government bonds with a guaranteed return, including for housing construction. ""A special solution will be the implementation of a pilot project and a broad expert discussion on the effects that a temporary 50% reduction or half of state co-financing of cost rent for young people and young families and temporary state co-financing of a certain share of salary at the first employment of young people , ""they added, explaining that the project would last until the end of 2022, and based on the findings, further measures would be taken.
NSi: It is necessary to increase the supply of housing and establish tax incentives for the construction of staff housing
NSi, meanwhile, supports the establishment of a credit guarantee scheme for young people for an ownership solution to the first housing problem. ""On the other hand, the supply of housing needs to be increased, so we need to provide vacant undeveloped land for housing construction,"" they are convinced. They pointed out the review of municipal spatial plans, which already envisage undeveloped building land for housing construction, but due to various administrative obstacles, construction is not possible. In addition, in their opinion, it will be necessary to enable faster adjustment of municipal spatial plans.
They are also advocating the establishment of a package of tax relief for the construction of staff housing. ""To help families living in rented apartments, we propose to exclude from the basis for determining the amount of kindergarten payment the installment of the loan taken out by parents to buy the property in which they actually live or to pay rent,"" they suggest. They reminded that they had succeeded in proposing a reduction in the tax burden on rents (from 27.5% to 15% so far), adding that they still had difficult steps to take to strengthen the legal security of landlords.
Let's connect Slovenia: The answer is regionalization and the creation of appropriate conditions throughout Slovenia
""We must enable young people to solve their housing problem on their own. The situation on the real estate market is somewhat distorted due to the centralization process. Our answer is regionalization and creating appropriate conditions throughout Slovenia. If we are effective in decentralization, the price will fall,"" he said. however, they are convinced of the Connect Slovenia movement.
They added that they agree that more funds should be allocated to solving housing problems, especially for those who are solving the housing problem for the first time. ""We will act in three directions here: we will strengthen the housing fund with guarantee schemes, make better use of the potentials of public-private partnerships and promote existing good practices at the local level. low-cost plots, and other good practices), ”they added.
SAB: Our goal is to rejuvenate public administration and provide young people with 5,000 jobs in public administration
""In a modern way, but much more decisively than is being done today, we will solve the housing challenges of young people, which will allow them to become independent earlier and easier to buy or rent their first apartment,"" they say at SAB. They say they will set up a guarantee housing scheme that will make it easier for young people to buy a home. At the same time, according to them, the state will provide more non-profit housing that will be more accessible to young people.
Among the measures with longer-term effects, they listed the introduction of models to facilitate the transition of young people from the education system to their first job. They believe that this will enable young people to secure stable employment much sooner. ""Our goal is to rejuvenate the public administration and provide young people with 5,000 jobs in the public administration,"" they added.
SD with the law to build 10,000 additional public rental housing
The Social Democrats have drafted a law to build 10,000 additional, new public rental housing. ""This is the largest public housing project to date, worth 1.3 billion euros, in the period up to 2030,"" they say, explaining that the model is based on the assumption that the average rent for a new 65 m2 apartment in Ljubljana does not exceed 350 euros per month. They also say that this is a transfer of a good model of construction of public rental housing in Vienna, ""which is considered one of the best in the world, with one important difference: while there the source of funding is the contribution to salaries, in this case budget funding or guarantees "".
At the same time, the law also stipulates that a special law will introduce a new systemic tax source, which will provide funds for the construction of public rental housing in a permanent manner. As they explain, it is potentially a part of the real estate tax, ""the absence of which in Slovenia is also one of the reasons for a number of anomalies we have in the housing and real estate field"". Simultaneously with the increase in the fund of public rental housing, they will propose the establishment of a legal possibility for the state, following the example of some other western countries, to allow municipalities to limit the growth of rents for rental housing. ""This would eliminate extortionate rents and prevent speculative construction in advance, which causes gentrification and the associated harmful social and economic consequences,"" they added at the SD.
SDS with a guarantee scheme for young people and an additional 6,000 public rental housing
The Slovenian Democratic Party has submitted to the National Assembly a proposal for the Youth Guarantee Scheme Act, which will enable young people under the age of 38 to apply for a loan to solve their first housing issue, which includes their first purchase. , construction, renovation or upgrading of residential real estate, reconstruction or change of use of premises into an apartment, if the apartment meets the surface norms for a suitable apartment in accordance with applicable law, you may receive a state guarantee.
The bill is already in its final stages and is about to be adopted, they reminded. ""We have additionally allocated funds to subsidize the rent of public rental housing, and by increasing the average amount, municipalities have been able to allocate part of these funds for the construction of public rental housing,"" they explain. An additional 6,000 public rented flats will be built by 2027 from the Housing Fund of the Republic of Slovenia and city and municipal funds from the construction of public rented flats.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/volilna-kampanja-v-franciji-postaja-vse-bolj-razgreta.html,The election campaign in France is getting hotter and hotter,"French President Emmanuel Macron held a grand rally in Marseille, the city where his far-right opponent in the second round of the presidential election on April 24, far-right Marine Le Pen, is otherwise strong. Rallies against the far right have been announced in several cities across France, as well as in support of Le Pen.","Emmanuel Macron told those gathered in Marseille that he would entrust the Prime Minister with the task of ecological planning. ""My policy over the next five years will be green or not,"" he said, announcing new investments in renewable energy. He announced the renewal of his current policy, saying that he understood the message he received in the first round of elections.
Macron is trying to get voters in Marseille to vote for left-wing Jean-Luc Melenchon in the first round. He received as much as 31 percent of the vote in a port in the south of France.
It is crucial for the French president to gain the support of Melenchon's voters if he wants to win in a good week and stay at the Elysee Palace for another five years.
Melenchon won nearly 22 percent of the vote in the first round nationally and was just a little behind Marine Le Pen. He called on his constituents not to vote for the far right in the second round, but at the same time did not clearly instruct them to support Macron.
He is now trying to get closer to the voters on the left, although he has been labeled president of the rich on several occasions in the past. Thus, he expressed his willingness to make some concessions on pension reform and was critical of the extremely high earnings of leaders in French companies, and today he also focused on ecology.
Five years ago, Macron defeated Le Pen convincingly because many voters backed him simply to prevent the far right from coming to power. Also this year, Macron called on the French to stop the far right, but the fight between the two candidates is more even, although the difference between them has increased slightly in recent days. Thus, the latest polls predict Macron's victory with 55 percent of the vote.
In France, a number of rallies against the far right have been announced today, called for by unions and other organizations. They are expected to take place in about 30 cities across the country.
Former Le Pen adviser Florian Philippot, who regularly protests against coronavirus measures on Saturdays, said his protest today would be a rally in support of Le Pen.
The far right was already the target of protesters who insulted a racist at a rally in Pertuis in the south of the country on Friday. She also became embroiled in a rather awkward exchange of views with a Muslim woman covered in a headscarf, who told her, among other things, that her father had fought for France for 15 years as a soldier.
In recent days, the issue of banning the concealment of women, which Le Pen intends to introduce, has also been at the forefront of the campaign. Macron, on the other hand, insists that wearing a headscarf is a matter of individual choice, and opposes the ban.
Today, however, Le Pen visited a small town in northwestern France, where she won convincingly in the first round. There, she promised to lead France as a family mother and protect the most vulnerable."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/odstevanje-do-volitev-kaj-so-stranke-v-kampanji-ze-pripravile-in-kaj-se-bodo.html,Countdown to the elections: what have the political parties already prepared and what will they do next?,"There is still a week until the election silence before the parliamentary elections, and despite the Easter holidays, the election campaign is in full swing. The Prime Minister and SDS Janez Janša laid the foundation stone for the new premises of the German company in Ormož, and his potential future partners were also on the ground. The parties of the opposite political pole, on the other hand, confronted their positions with the people - in the Republic Square, the Voice of the People initiative organized the first direct confrontation between the parties and the people.","There is no rest at the beginning of the holidays a week before the elections, part of the government team participated in the ceremony at the beginning of the construction of the new plant of the German company Carthago.
Zdravko Počivalšek said there that Slovenia is only as strong as its economy.
Prime Minister Janez Janša: ""The only successful social policy is the policy of creating new jobs."" A job, however, to enable the one who is employed to take care of himself, his family and the community, he added. ""Everything else we sometimes hear about how practically money grows on a tree, however, is the main problem of how to share it ... I'm not going to use that word that such behavior deserves, but it's completely over.""
Today, the president of the Our Country party, Aleksandra Pivec, also met with her candidates. ""When, if not now, is the time for politics to unify, unite and try to answer those questions that will help people's work and lives,"" she said.
None of the parties that are part of or sympathizers of the current coalition were present at yesterday's public confrontation, which took place instead of Friday's protest. The atmosphere before the confrontation was very relaxed and the umbrellas soon proved to be very welcome.
But the confrontation was carried out by the organizers. In some respects, the parties were completely united. For example, when asked whether they believe that single women should be given access to biomedical assisted reproduction. Again, not in others - for example, whether to promote a rental scheme by buying flats.
Responding directly to people seemed important to the participants. ""If the weather was nice, it would be even easier. But maybe it's also a test of how serious we are, by saying we're politicians here because of the people,"" Robert Golob said.
""We were parties here, which showed that we are ready to turn over a new leaf after April 24, that we are not afraid of the people and that we want to cooperate with civil society,"" said Luka Mesec.

The main message of the Voice of the People initiative is that every vote counts, so they call for a mass turnout."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/soproga-putinovega-zaveznika-predlaga-izmenjavo.html,Medvedchuk's wife asks: Swap my husband for the trapped Brits,"The wife of pro-Russian politician Viktor Medvedchuk, who was arrested by the Ukrainian security service a few days ago, released a video in which she asks British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for help. Convinced that she can influence President Zelensky's opinion, she suggests that her husband be released in exchange for British citizens who surrendered to the Russians.","""Dear Prime Minister Johnson, I am Oksana Marchenko, the wife of Viktor Medvedchuk, a politician. I am asking you to help replace my husband, who was illegally detained by the Kiev authorities for political reasons and false accusations, for your citizens, Aiden Aslin and Sean Pinner. ""Prime Minister, you have a great influence on President Zelensky. If you care about your citizens, help their families and friends get Aiden and Sean back. Help me get Viktor back,"" he asked.
Let's remember. Ukraine's security service said on Tuesday that it had arrested Medvedchuk, a prominent pro-Russian MP, one of Ukraine's most influential politicians in the past and one of Ukraine's richest men. President Vladimir Putin is also his daughter's godfather.
A few days after the start of the Russian invasion, Medvedchuk escaped from house arrest, and now he has been captured by Ukrainian forces in a special operation. Already last year, proceedings were instituted against him in Ukraine for treason and embezzlement, but he himself denies all charges.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who posted a photo of Medvedchuk in Ukrainian uniform and handcuffed, offered Russia his replacement for the captured Ukrainian soldiers. ""I propose to the Russian Federation to replace this guy of yours with our boys and girls who are now in Russian captivity,"" he said in a video address posted on the Telegram.
By doing so, however, he provoked a sharp reaction from Moscow. First, the former president and prime minister of Russia, and now the deputy chairman of the Russian Security Council, Dmitry Medvedev, spoke. ""These bastards, who identify themselves as the Ukrainian authorities, say they want to force Medvedchuk to confess, quickly and fairly, condemn him and then exchange him for prisoners of war (...) These people should be careful and lock the door well at night to they will not themselves become the ones to be exchanged, ”he was sharp.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later added that the Kremlin would closely monitor Medvedchuk's fate and called on European politicians to do so, ""given that they are always so concerned about freedom of speech"". He described the proceedings against him as politically motivated, but at the same time rejected the possibility of an exchange, saying that he was a ""Ukrainian citizen and a foreign politician""."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/ceferin-o-slovenski-politiki-grof-drakula-v-boj-proti-ljudem-posilja-vampirje.html,Ceferin on Slovenian politics: Count Dracula sends vampires to fight people,"One of the most influential and recognizable Slovenian faces, Uefa President Aleksander Čeferin, spoke about the tax demanded by the war in Ukraine, relations with Russia and Slovenian politics. At the beginning of the war, Uefa came to the aid of many footballers who were trying to leave the attacked country, but they quickly realized that the announced Champions League final in St. Petersburg would not be possible. He emphasized the importance of co-operation at both the sports and political levels, and was critical of Slovenian politics: ""Sometimes the picture reminds me of Transylvania, where Count Dracula sends his vampires to fight people. But the morning will come.""","The journalist hinted in an interview with the Večer newspaper that there has been a ""fear"" for a long time that UEFA President Aleksander Čeferin will get involved in politics. Ceferin has repeatedly criticized the current government, but this time he focused on the ""horrible absence of any criticism"". ""Attacks on anyone who opens his mouth and has a different opinion, even if he expresses it respectfully, are also appalling,"" he said. He expects that the latter will worsen in the last days before the elections, but for now he is still happy that Slovenia is ""at least so democratic that they cannot imprison us"".
“Sometimes the picture reminds me of Transylvania, where Count Dracula sends his vampires to fight humans,” he caricatured, but added that the morning will surely come as well. He emphasized that the problem with Slovenia's ruling policy was that it did not respect institutions that had become a ""disgusting part of the system"". ""When civil society becomes disruptive to power and politics tries to suppress it, a big problem arises. There is also a problem if we distinguish between a mother with Christian and Muslim values. Civil society must always maintain an oppositional role,"" he said.
According to him, the task of the authorities is to try to coexist with civil society, not to oppress, humiliate, file criminal charges and other things. ""Such repression always has a boomerang effect."" He is convinced that Slovenia can only be successful if it is united: ""Discrediting, lying and insulting violence is already happening, so this way of working must stop.""
'Political passivity among voters encourages populists'
He emphasizes that people who want to put Slovenia on their head have teachers abroad, that the latter are more advanced, as they have already successfully taken over the media: ""Thank God, most media in Slovenia are still independent."" He also believes that people are not even aware that the disintegration of independent institutions has dire consequences for society as a whole. ""The importance of the rule of law should certainly be given more attention,"" he said, citing Dante Alighieri that the hottest part of hell is reserved for those who maintain their neutrality during a moral crisis.
Nevertheless, Ceferin does not intend to enter politics, but emphasizes that people in the elections must choose the one they find most credible. ""As a society, we need to clarify what we want in the future. People are smart and will certainly make good decisions,"" he said. ""It is the political passivity among the voters that gives impetus to the populists,"" he added.
At the same time, he believes that no one should go into politics to make money. He therefore considers financial independence important, but as he points out, there are also many ""excellent scientists and professors in Slovenia who are poorly paid and will never be completely financially independent"".
About the measures taken by Uefa in the light of the war
In the interview, he also touched on the war in Ukraine and cooperation with Russia. He believes that Russian sport should not suffer because of the decisions of individuals, but that certain sanctions should have been adopted at Uefa as well. ""It should be noted that this is not a war against Russian athletes or the Russian people. Although this is not their fight, they will suffer the consequences. Uefa will soon decide whether Russian clubs will be able to compete in European competitions,"" he said.
After the start of the war, they quickly realized that the final in St. Petersburg would not be possible. ""The president of the Russian Federation understood Uefa's decision in some way. He said little about the interference of politics in sports, but it is difficult for us to understand, given that in Russia all sports decisions are made at the regime level,"" he said. he said. He added that they maintain correct relations with the Russian Federation, and that there was no pressure to postpone the final.
They also terminated the sponsorship agreement with the Russian company Gazprom, which brought them a loss of around 100 million. ""It's a lot, but in a difficult situation, it's impossible to advertise Gazprom around the Champions League pitch if there is a bloody war in Ukraine. We made our decision independently of politics and I don't want anyone to salt our brains,"" he explained. Gazprom chief Alexander Djukov remains a member of Uefa's executive committee, and the Russian Football Association has not been expelled.
Russophobia is also felt in the world of sports. He described the events from the congress in Qatar, where the delegates of the Russian Federation hid from other participants. People were turning away from them, pretending not to know them, he said. ""The story is reminiscent of terrorist attacks, when mostly primitives equated all Muslims with terrorists. Now the same people condemn all Russians as war criminals, but believe me, Russians do not support war in a neighboring country.""
He sees Slovenia's role in the events in Ukraine as an unnecessary exposure
He believes that more attention should be paid to calling for peace and joint agreements, adding that he sees Slovenia's role in the events in Ukraine as unnecessary exposure. ""Every government should take care of Slovenia's interests, not its own profiling. I believe that power is sweet and it is important to win elections, but Slovenia's interests should not be highlighted due to personal promotion,"" he said.
That Slovenia should remain part of the core of the EU and that individual actions are meaningless: ""However, fortunately they have no special significance at the global level.""
He has already met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and described him as a person who was always well prepared for meetings. He has also already met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is an interesting man but has no special relationship with him."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/o-kadrovanju-pravni-drzavi-medijih-kateri-so-viri-nezaupanja-v-politiko.html,"About staffing, the rule of law, the media: what are the sources of (dis) trust in politics?","A good week separates us from the day when we will decide in the elections in which direction our country should go in the next four years. Voter turnout is usually below the European average. Why don't Slovenians trust politicians? Polona Rifel from Connect Slovenia, Matej T. Vatovec from Levica, Robert Pavšič from LMŠ, Aleš Hojs from SDS, Matjaž Nemec from SD and Mark B. Andrijanič from NSi talked with the leader Gregor Trebušak about the rule of law, freedom of the media and staffing.","
Soočenje se je začelo z vprašanjem na temo medijske svobode. Ameriški State Department vsako leto izda poročilo o medijski svobodi. V letošnjem poročilu na primer izpostavljajo pritiske vlade na STA in RTV, pa premierjeve napade na našo medijsko hišo, opozarjajo tudi, da na Twitterju ne gre napisati kar vsega. Andrijanič je uvodoma ocenil, da so mediji pri nas svobodni. ""V državah, kjer niso svobodni, mediji vlad ne kritizirajo, pri nas pa je kritika vlade nekaj običajnega, prej pravilo kot izjema. Tudi ne poznam nobenega novinarja ali urednika, ki bi zaradi svojega poročanja izgubil službo ali še huje, da bi se mu skrivil kakšen las na glavi. V taki državi na srečo ne živimo, Slovenija je svobodna država. Ni sicer brez napak, mislim pa, da smo del evropske celine, ki svobodo medijev in posameznika neizmerno ceni.""
 Nemec je temu ugovarjal: ""Jaz pa poznam posameznike, ki so bili prisiljeni zapustiti službo prav zaradi mobinga. Pritiski na urednike in lastnike so veliki, predvsem kar se tiče želje po financiranju oglasov od podjetij, ki so blizu vodilnih političnih strank – z jasnim ciljem, da se poroča bolj prijazno do vladajoče garniture. Medijski prostor v Sloveniji se, kar se tiče svobode, oži. Mi smo kot ukrep pripravili dva zakona, zakon o RTV in zakon o medijih,"" je dejal Nemec, ki upa, da bo ""prihodnja levosredinska vlada spremembe nemudoma poslala v DZ"".
Hojs v družbenih omrežjih vidi velike prednosti: ""Ne govorim konkretno o vas, ampak v zadnjem letu sem bil deležen množice lažnivih poročanj in seveda, kje drugje kot na Twitterju naj to človek demantira? To je edina pot, kajti novinarji so v pretežni meri še zmeraj inštrumentalizirani od kolegov bivše levice. Prav bizarno je na vaši televiziji, torej 24UR poslušati, kako želimo kogar koli utišati, dajati uredniške napotke, ko pa ste v dveh letih – po moji oceni – tisti, ki niste našli niti enega pozitivnega prispevka za to vlado. Vaš cilj je bil to vlado vseskozi diskreditirati, napadati, o njej povedati vse najslabše. Vem, da to boli tudi vas, zato je naša odkrita beseda za vas moteča. Ampak verjamem, da so volivci to prepoznali in cenijo, da smo politiki odkriti.""
Pavšič meni, da bi morali po takšnem poročilu ""zazvoniti vsi alarmi"": ""Ampak točno vidimo, kakšen je odnos."" Po kratkem besednem spopadu s Hojsom o (ne)spoštljivem odnosu do novinarjev je stanje na RTV ocenil kot katastrofalno: ""Upira se celotna novinarska sfera in tako ne gre naprej. Zakon o RTV bo treba spremeniti, pa ne na način, kot so si zamislili v koalicijskih strankah, ampak tako, da se iz vodstva – vsaj iz vsebinskega dela –takoj umakne politiko. Politika namreč pri tistem, ki ji nastavlja ogledalo, nima kaj početi.""
Vatovec se je strinjal, da bi morali zvoniti alarmi: ""To, da ni bil skrivljen noben las, je laž. Spomnimo se samo na STA, koliko časa ga je vlada hirala, koliko časa je zamikala izplačila. In če pogledamo stanje na RTV, vidimo, da so mediji, ki bi morali biti v javnem interesu, močno na udaru. Videli smo prekinitev nekaterih kritičnih oddaj v predvolilnem času in vidimo, kako se določene novinarje degradira na status navadnega novinarja, prihaja do menjav urednikov."" SDS je poočital, da so ""s pomočjo madžarskega denarja zgradili svoj medijski svet"". Glede rešitev je poudaril, da mora biti status medijev v vsaki sodobni družbi nekaj, kar se varuje. Izpostavil je preureditev zakona o RTV, katerega cilj bi morala biti depolitizacija. Ocenil je, da je depolitizacija mogoča tudi, če zakon piše politika – če je dovolj politične volje, zagotovilo za depolitizacijo pa je malo ali nič prisotnosti politike v programskem svetu.
Rifljeva je poudarila, da se pri Povežimo Slovenijo zavzemajo predvsem za transparentno lastništvo medijev. ""Ko bo lastništvo transparentno, bodo lahko uporabniki sami precenili, kam kdo taco moli,"" je ocenila. Ko gre za RTV pa je dejala, da si v programskem svetu želijo enakomerno prisotnost opozicije in pozicije. ""Bi se pa morali novinarji večkrat pogledati v ogledalo, ker se na družbenih omrežjih večkrat deklarirajo za levo ali desno opcijo, kar pa za neodvisno novinarstvo ni dobro."" Tako Rifljeva kot Hojs sta se obregnila ob to, da naj bi tudi leva politična opcija leta izvajala svoj vpliv na RTV. Nemec pa se je zavzel za bolj spoštljiv dialog med mediji in politiko, saj da je postal ""neznosen"".
Rogljički ter KPK, NPU … Česa (ne) potrebujemo?
V nadaljevanju so se sogovorniki dotaknili pravne države. Na vprašanje, ali je bila v času koronakrize težava, da vatli za vse niso bili enaki, saj se kršiteljem ukrepov iz političnih vrst ni zgodilo nič, imeli pa smo afero ""rogljiček"", je Hojs dejal, da ""gotovo"". ""Tudi vsak izmed nas je storil kakšno napako, nihče ni nezmotljiv. Prepričan sem tudi, da bi vsak izmed nas kakšne stvari, če bi jih lahko naredil znova, naredil drugače."" Ga je pa zmotilo, da mediji niso poročali o ""celotni zgodbi"" v primeru rogljička ali branja ustave, je poudaril.
Nemec je prepričan, da ""še nikoli nismo bili priča tako temnim časom v odnosu med svobodo in represijo"". Vladajoči koaliciji je poočital, da si je ob medijih želela podrediti še Policijo, z zmanjšanjem finančnih sredstev pa tudi sodstvo. ""To so ključni elementi, ko želiš demokratično družbo pripeljati v vode avtoritarizma,"" ocenjuje Nemec.
Andrijanič je glede dvojnih meril dejal, da pred zakonom ""absolutno moramo biti vsi enaki"". Dejal pa je, da so povsod po Evropi veljali identični, če ne še strožji ukrepi za zajezitev pandemije, ""pa ni nihče kričal o represiji"". ""Kar pa je še bolj pomembno, pa je, da je bila v večini drugih evropskih držav opozicija pripravljena narediti korak nazaj in podpreti vladna prizadevanja, četudi morda niso bila najboljša. Enostavno zato, ker je v težkih časih enotnost nujna."" Opozoril je, da časi niso enostavni in bi bilo tudi zdaj nujno stopiti skupaj. Glede protestov pa je opozoril, da bi neprijavljen protest v Bruslju ali Berlinu ""trajal le do prihoda prvega policista"". ""Pravica do protestiranja je ena od temeljnih pravic, ampak tudi tu veljajo pravila,"" je opozoril.
Pavšič je vladi očital postavljanje ograj pred miroljubnimi ljudmi, ""ki so sedeli pet metrov narazen in brali ustavo. Očitno se jim to zdi zelo nevarno."" Ko gre za upravljanje s koronsko krizo, pa je bil kritičen do odločitve vlade, da glavni govorci, ki so posredovali informacije o pandemiji, ostanejo isti tudi po tem, ko je raziskava pokazala, da so deležni nezaupanja ljudi. ""V osnovi je bilo vse skupaj zgrešeno,"" je ocenil. Po njegovem je večina ljudi upoštevala ukrepe, peščica, ki jih ni, pa jih ni zaradi političnih razlogov. ""Opozicija ni bila kriva, da ste zavozili epidemijo,"" je še vztrajal.
Vatovec je menil, da vsakdo, ki se zapleta v takšne ali drugačne koruptivne posle, za Levico ni sprejemljiv, po njegovem pa so nepravilnosti tudi razlog, zakaj ljudje politiki ne zaupajo več. ""Ljudje niso začeli protestirati zaradi ukrepov. Najprej so začeli protestirati zaradi izdaje volivcev. SMC, DeSUS in tako naprej so podprli nastanek te koalicije, čeprav so prej zatrjevali, da tega ne bodo storili. Protesti pa so se nato nadaljevali zaradi zlorabe epidemije. Spomnite se mask iz serviet z gumico, postelj z respiratorji, vprašanj okoli iskreni.net in ministra Ciglerja Kralja, izgubljenih tovornjakov z zaščitno opremo gospoda Tonina …""
 Rifljeva je poudarila, da morajo za vse veljati enaka pravila. ""Verjamem v pravno državo in verjamem, da bodo tisti, ki so dobili globe, lahko poiskali sodno varstvo in dobili odgovore od pristojnih organov. Tu težko govorimo o represiji,"" je ocenila in izpostavila veliko število poškodovanih policistov na protestih. ""Verjamem, da policisti delajo dobro."" Glede mnenja KPK o ministru Zdravku Počivalšku pa je dejala, da je KPK krivdo pripisala direktorju blagovnih rezerv.
Pavšič se s tem ni strinjal, dejal je, da gre za zelo domiselno interpretacijo ugotovitev KPK: ""Ni bil samo KPK tisti, ki je ugotovil, da je minister Počivalšek krši integriteto, torej tisto, kar ga dela ministra. Izgubil je zaupanje, odločba je bila pravnomočna tako proti njemu kot nekdanjemu državnemu sekretarju Alešu Cantaruttiju. Danes je Počivalšek še vedno minister in kandidira za naslednji sklic parlamenta, gospod Cantarutti je dobil krasno službo. Kot da se ni zgodilo nič."" Dejal je tudi, da NPU kazensko ovadbo zoper Počivalška in vse, ""ki so bili zraven pri nabavi zaščitne medicinske opreme, drži v predalu"".
Hojs je ocenil, da KPK v aktualni obliki ne potrebujemo. ""KPK je forum, ki je primeren za politične obsodbe."" Dejal je, da KPK vztraja pri tem, da bi na podlagi njihovih mnenj odstopali ministri, kar sam ocenjuje kot nesprejemljivo. ""To je nepotrebno slepo črevo v naši družbi. Okrepiti je treba tožilstvo, Policijo, potrebujemo finančno policijo, ne organa, ki daje načelna mnenja.""
Vatovec je ocenil, da želi vlada ""pomesti vse institucije, nad katerimi nima nadzora"". ""Če bi SDS na vrh KPK imenovala svojega človeka, s KPK ne bi imeli nobenih težav,"" je prepričan.
Andrijanič pa je prepričan, da je čas, da rečemo bobu bob: ""Nobenih težav z nakupi opreme ne bi bilo, če prejšnja koalicija za seboj ne bi pustila praznih skladišč."" KPK pa ne bi ukinil. ""Bi pa izpostavil nekaj drugega. Ko gre za vladavino prava, mislim, da naše državljane mnogo bolj skrbijo sodni zaostanki, ki uničujejo življenja državljanov in gospodarstvo. Več kot 260-krat je že Evropsko sodišče za človekove pravice Slovenijo obsodilo zaradi sojenja v nerazumnem roku.""
Nemec se je strinjal, da to je težava, a je izpostavil, da smo ""Slovenci nagnjeni k temu, da imamo nadpovprečno število tovrstnih tožb po raznih institucijah"". Poudaril pa je, da so zaskrbljenost nad stanjem demokracije pri nas izpostavile vse štiri nadzorne institucije – varuh človekovih pravic, KPK, Računsko sodišče in informacijska pooblaščenka. ""Ne vem, kaj je še potrebno, da razumemo, da imamo v naši državi resno krizo demokracije?""
Tudi Rifljeva nasprotuje ukinitvi KPK, dejala pa je, da imamo v Sloveniji sodne zaostanke, kljub nadpovprečnemu številu sodnikov. Izpostavila je počasno delo NPU, tudi v preteklosti, in izpostavila primere Grep, farmacevtka … Dejala je, da bi morali razmisliti, kaj storiti s takšnimi institucijami.
""Ljudi boli, ko je nekomu odpisanih več kot 40 milijonov evrov. Družina Jankovič. Boli jih, ko tukaj niso enaki,"" pa je k vsemu skupaj dodal Hojs. Andrijanič pa je dodal nerešene afere Teš 6, bančna luknja, Stožice … ""Ko gre za običajne ljudi, sodni sistem dobro deluje, ko gre za ljudi z denarjem, pa se začnejo stvari zapletati.""
Vaši in naši kadri
Sogovorniki so razpravljali tudi o kadrovanju. Na vprašanje, kakšna je razlika med povolilno čistko, ki jo napoveduje potencialna prihodnja vlada, in tisto, ki jo je izvedel SDS, je Vatovec dejal, da ""pri tej vladi ni šlo za vprašanje kompetenc, ampak stroge poslušnosti"". ""Zakaj je gospod Matoz postal nadzornik v dveh podjetjih in izvršni direktor DUTB? Ker je odvetnik gospoda Janše.""
Hojs je dejal, da ima Slovenija težavo majhnosti: ""Ko narediš dva koraka, srečaš sorodnika, prijatelja …"" Pretekli opciji pa je poočital, da so njihovi kadri sedeli tudi na šestih funkcijah.
""NSi se zavzema za umik politike iz gospodarstva,"" pa je dejal Andrijanič. ""To pa bo prinesla privatizacija deležev, ki niso strateški."" Na vprašanje, ali je to Dars, ki ga vodi NSi-jev Valentin Hajdinjak, pa je dejal, da Dars predstavlja infrastrukturo, ki je strateškega pomena in od koder se država ne sme umikati: ""Ni pa nobene potrebe, da država igra hotelirja, saj ima težave že z opravljanjem osnovnih javnih funkcij."" Andrijanič je sicer prepričan, da je Hajdinjak, ki je na Dars prišel brez podobnih delovnih izkušenj, svoje delo opravil dobro, predlagal je, da se ljudi sodi po rezultatih. ""Prinesel je učinkovitost,"" je še ocenil.
Nemec pa je mnenja, da prav zato ljudje nimajo zaupanja v politiko. ""Ko ti v program zapišeš umik politike iz gospodarstva in potem narediš ravno nasprotno, ljudje ne verjamejo več v politiko."" Dejal je, da je treba biti načelen. Ko gre za delo Hajdinjaka, pa je ocenil, da je nemogoče dokazati, da so izpeljani Darsovi projekti odvisni od enega človeka: ""Nastavljali so se desetletja.""
Če bodo sestavljali novo vlado, je Pavšič napovedal hitro in natančno revizijo vseh zaposlitev, pri čemer pa ne bo pomembna ""barva"", ampak kompetence. ""Ne smemo pa pozabiti, da Dars ni parkirišče samo za podpredsednike strank, ampak tudi za tiste, ki so odstopili zaradi nabav zaščitne opreme. Zgodbe je treba povezati. Imamo Dars, drugi tir, Luko Koper in energetiko. Povsod se v zadnjem času pojavljata samo SDS in Nova Slovenija.""
Rifljeva je dejala, da zagovarjajo imenovanja kompetentnih ljudi – ne glede na to, od kod kdo prihaja. ""Zanima pa me, ali bo prihodnja vlada na Darsu izvedla menjavo samo zato, ker gre za podpredsednika stranke, glede na to, da smo slišali, da družba uspešno posluje?"" Bi si pa, tako Rifljeva, na odgovornih mestih želeli več žensk. Vatovec je glede Hajdinjaka dejal, da bodo v vseh primerih pregledali poslovanje podjetij.
Glede privatizacije hotelov pa Vatovec meni, da bi država morala imeti interes, da ohranja kritično turistično infrastrukturo, kar hoteli so, v državni lasti. Andrijanič pa je dejal, da še ni videl hotelskega investitorja, ki bi hotel ""dal na tovornjak in ga odpeljal drugam"". ""Slovenske hotelske kapacitete bodo polne, potrebujemo pa pametne, strateške lastnike, ki bodo v te kapacitete vlagali in razvijali celotne destinacije. Država pa naj denar raje vlaga v javno zdravstvo, v socialo in ostale stvari, ki so za državljane pomembne, ne pa v kupovanje hotelov. To ni primarna naloga države.""
Nemec je menil, da takšna vlaganja lahko opravi država, ki ima zdravo gospodarstvo: ""Ali nimamo dovolj sposobnih menedžerjev, da vodijo naš dragulj turizma? To je hitro rastoča panoga.""
Vatovec pa je opozoril, da hotelov resda nihče ne odpelje, da pa smo videli primere, ko so novi lastniki prepolovili delovno silo, uvedli prekarno delo in le malo vlagali v infrastrukturo.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/katere-izjave-in-soocenja-so-najbolj-zaznamovala-dosedanjo-predvolilno-kampanjo.html,Which statements and confrontations have most marked the election campaign so far?,"Behind us are three pre-election confrontations on POP TV, two more are waiting for us. It sparked several times, among various representatives of political parties. But which statements are the ones that have most marked the pre-election confrontations so far?","Even before we received the first answer at the first confrontation, Interior Minister Aleš Hojs spiced up the introduction with the words: ""The Prime Minister will confront anyone, either on your TV show or on public RTV, including the electro-oligarch standing to my left."" With these words, of course, he had in mind the former director of Gen-i, Robert Golob.
And then the rhetorical spice remained in the second confrontation as well. ""Probably his 45,000-euro award a month led to a colleague labeling him an oligarch,"" said Romana Tomc.
""It's like signing a contract yourself,"" Golob said, noting that the contract is always signed by the owner.
She also stayed in the debate on high bills. “The electro-oligarch also complained because the price in the market was too high, and then sold it to citizens at a disproportionately high price,” Hoys said.
""We have already clarified this with the Minister of Police. His every word about Gen-i is a lie,"" Golob replied.
Who can and who cannot ensure stable energy prices? ""The price will be comparable to what we have today,"" said Infrastructure Minister Jernej Vrtovec. ""If I am the Minister of Infrastructure, I guarantee you that,"" he added. But Golob replied that ""this has no contact with reality"", as the minister does not guarantee prices.
The topic of foreign policy was also sparked when the coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, asked Tomčeva if Bidna had already been congratulated for winning the US elections: ""Are you still congratulating Trump? Have you already congratulated Zelenski or insisted that Putin is a mercenary?"" ""
""Our foreign policy is the best foreign policy so far,"" Tomčeva said. “The government is meeting with everyone, the foreign minister has made hundreds of visits,” she enumerated.
There were also allegations of wages. ""The police minister knows exactly what salary awaits him after the end of his term. He is also among those who will be the most relieved,"" said the former director of Gen-i. ""It is bizarre to listen to a man who has earned 250 thousand euros gross in recent years,"" Hojs was not indebted to him, saying that he was waiting for ""about half the salary that Golob currently has"". ""About 4,000 euros gross,"" the interior minister said, to which Golob corrected that it was actually a net salary.
And it is boiling hot in solving corruption in Slovenian healthcare. ""I am really sorry for Ms Godec. When she was in the opposition position in parliament, she was one of the biggest anti-corruption fighters. to be able to explain how they got the money for it, ”Golob was critical.
""Mr. Golob should not be sorry for me, because I am not defending anyone. But I am worried if he is in government, that every purchase will have a 15% commission, as it should be in Bosnia and Herzegovina,"" she replied.
Confrontations, however, will continue. There will be two more on POP TV - the first next Monday, and the last next Friday."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/civilna-iniciativa-danes-opozarja-pred-povecanjem-soseziga-v-anhovem.html,The Civil Initiative Today warns of an increase in co-incineration in Anhovo,"Salonit Anhovo will double the co-incineration of waste. From now on, 220,000 tons of waste are to be incinerated annually, the Civil Initiative Today reported. As calculated, the increase is three times higher than when 600 doctors warned of the harmful effects of co-incineration and double standards, while urging decision-makers to equalize the limit values ​​and take into account the health status of local residents.","As warned in the Civil Initiative Today, the increase is so inconceivably large that it exceeds the imagination of reasonable people. More than 600 tons of waste will be incinerated every day, and more rubbish will be co-incinerated in Anhovo than in seven Celje incinerators, where they do so under much stricter criteria. ""
The presentations of Salonita Anhovo, which are currently taking place in the municipality of Kanal ob Soči, are supposed to reduce total emissions and reach limit values ​​equal to the limit values ​​for incinerators or even below them. Wastewater treatment plants and filters are expected to be built in two or three years. The Civil Initiative does not believe this. ""The real plans of Salonita Anhovo are revealed only by the questions of the residents. Everything is conditioned by doubling the co-incineration to 220,000 tons and increasing production. The presented reduction of emissions is not binding and is prepared for the purpose of presentation. We suggested that the company first obtain an environmental permit only for the construction of sewage treatment plants and filters, without increasing co-incineration.
As they wrote, the members of the management of Salonita immediately rejected Anho's proposal. As pointed out in Today, residents demand the construction of sewage treatment plants and filters without increasing waste co-incineration. They also demand that the emission limit values ​​for cement plants be equated with those applicable to incineration plants.
The Eco Circle adds: ""Such an increase in the amount of incinerated waste in the Anhovo cement plant is insane. Firstly, because this is happening in an environment where the tragic heritage of asbestos should not do so. Secondly, because politics and business are clearly silent And thirdly, because Slovenia is already lagging behind the EU average in the transition to a low-carbon circular economy, which does not include incineration or co-incineration of waste. ""
Aljoša Petek from the Legal Center for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment (PIC) emphasizes: ""At this point, when the company's intention is clear, it is the state and local government's turn. his will and health are primarily taken into account, not the increase in the multimillion-dollar profits of private, foreign owners. ""
So far, the parties Vesna and Levica have responded to the call of initiatives for politicians to declare themselves. In Vesna, the proposed increase in co-incineration was described as inhumane, insensitive and a death sentence for the Soča Valley. They join the demand that Salonit first build the promised treatment plants and filters, support the equalization of emission limit values ​​and advocate further tightening. They also emphasize the importance of monitoring.
The Left believes that Salonit wants to worsen the environmental and health picture in the local environment with plans to increase profits. They oppose this and demand a reduction in the amount of waste incineration, equalization of emission limit values ​​in incineration and co-incineration plants and increased control over the measurement of emissions. ""We will achieve this in accordance with the program in the next term of the National Assembly,"" they added in a press release.
Salonita's response: The Green Passage is not a fairy tale for us, it is a very concrete reality
They also responded with a press release in Salonit, where they did not provide detailed information on the increase in the amount of incineration, but stressed that they were planning a green transition. Despite the increased production capacity, all planned upgrades will significantly reduce the impact of the cement plant on the environment, as they will use the latest innovative technologies, which are currently used in less than ten percent of over 200 cement plants in Europe. .
They added that they understand the insecurity of the local population, so in April they organize meetings with locals in all local communities of Kanal ob Soči, where they present their development plans and personally and transparently answer all questions.
Member of the Management Board Tomaž Vuk explained that the modernization of the cement plant, which they present to the locals, is the result of strategic planning and careful consideration, as they strive to reduce environmental impact in absolute terms.
""The green passage of the cement plant is not a fairy tale for us, it is a very concrete reality and a vision to which we devote a lot of effort, dedication of our employees, networking with experts at the global level and financial investments. brought many development opportunities and innovations to the middle Soča Valley as well, ""he emphasized."

However, the Kremlin responds to Ukraine's proposal: ""Medvedchuk is a Ukrainian citizen and a foreign politician."" So it looks like there will be no replacement. In Mariupol, meanwhile, more than 1,000 fighters of the 36th Navy Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have surrendered, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Ukraine has denied the surrender of its troops.","In his new address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pointed out that Ukrainian business oligarch Viktor Medvedchuk had been hiding for 48 days after escaping from house arrest before finally trying to flee the country. ""I find it particularly cynical that he tried to escape in the uniform of the Ukrainian army. He tried to disguise himself. What a soldier. What a patriot,"" Zelensky said. He added: ""If Medvedchuk decides to wear a military uniform, then the rules of war apply to him.""
Zelensky said that he had proposed to Russia to replace the arrested oligarch with Ukrainian civilians and soldiers in Russian captivity. ""It is important that our security forces and the army also consider this possibility,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters.
The Kremlin also responded to the proposal of the Ukrainian president. As they claim, Medvedchuk did not have ""behind-the-scenes talks with Russia"". According to Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov, all indications are that the proposed replacement will not take place, foreign media reported. ""As for the exchange, which was so passionately talked about in Kiev - Medvedchuk is not a Russian citizen and has nothing to do with the military operation,"" he said, stressing that the captured oligarch is also a foreign politician. ""We don't know if he wants to cooperate. However, Russia is resolving the situation,"" he added.
In his address, Zelensky was appalled, among other things, by Russia's war plan. ""In Russia, they said their operations are going as planned. But to be honest, no one in the world understands how such a plan can be successful. How successful can a plan be if tens of thousands of their own have died in just over a month ""Who would approve such a plan? How many of their own soldiers must die for it to be acceptable to Russia?"" he wondered.
The United Kingdom has sanctioned another 206 individuals for invading Ukraine, including Viktor Medvedchuk. The Ukrainian oligarch's funds were frozen and travel banned, the British government said. As they said, the US has already identified Medvedchuk as a ""possible Kremlin puppet in Ukraine."" In 2014, Washington also sanctioned him in connection with the Russian invasion of Crimea.
Medvedchuk, a former leader of Ukraine's pro-Russian opposition party, was placed under house arrest last year but escaped shortly after the invasion.
The list also included the wife of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Mario Lavrov, the executive assistant of oligarch Mikhail Friedman, Nigina Zairova, and the head of Russia's Ozone online shopping platform, Alexander Shulgin.
Russian Ministry of Defense: More than 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers surrendered in Mariupol
Russia's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said 1,026 members of the 36th Navy Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces had voluntarily laid down their arms in Mariupol and surrendered ""due to a successful offensive by Russian armed forces and units of the Donetsk People's Republic."" Among them are said to be 162 officers and 47 female soldiers. The ministry also said that 151 wounded Ukrainian soldiers were immediately given primary medical care on the spot, and then taken to the city hospital in Mariupol for further treatment. Russian war journalists Alexander Sladkov and Semyon Pengov also reported that there was the largest surrender of Ukrainian soldiers to date.
We reported as early as Tuesday that separatist forces in eastern Ukraine were to take over Mariupol. The leader of the pro-Russian rebels, Denis Pushilin, claimed on Monday that the port of Mariupol was already under the control of Russian forces. Around 1,500 soldiers were initially said to have tried to break out of Mariupol, but according to Russian authorities, the attempt was thwarted, part of the Ukrainian army was destroyed and some surrendered.
Ukraine denies surrendering. ""In Mariupol, units of the 36th Brigade managed to break through to the Azov Regiment,"" Alexei Arestovich, Zelensky's political adviser, wrote on Twitter, adding: ""This happens when commanders keep a calm head and maintain firm command and control of troops."" ""Let's not lose. The army knows what it's doing,"" he added.
Former Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov also hinted at the possibility of exchanging prisoners on Twitter on Tuesday. ""The Kremlin should provide a safe corridor for the withdrawal of our civilians and the army from Mariupol, and we will hand over Košče to them,"" he wrote. He is speculating that he was alluding to Medevchuk.
Influential pro-Russian politician Medvedchuk was arrested on Tuesday
Information about the surrender of Ukrainian soldiers came to light a few hours before the announcement of Medvedchuk's arrest. Ukraine's security services say they have arrested Medvedchuk, Ukraine's closest and most influential ally in Ukraine.
A pro-Russian opposition lawmaker and oligarch suspected of treason escaped house arrest on February 27. The court ordered his house arrest in two criminal cases, namely for irregularities in oil and gas production in the Black Sea and for supporting the activities of a terrorist organization that allegedly helped it by supplying coal from the temporarily occupied territories of Donbas, Ukrinform reports.
It is known that Medvedchuk has a close relationship with Putin. Among other things, Putin is his daughter's godfather, and according to the Washington Post, he and Putin are also vacationing and watching Formula 1 races and martial arts races."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/izziv-za-politiko-elektrike-porabimo-vse-vec-proizvodnja-ne-dosega-potreb.html,"Policy challenge: we are consuming more and more electricity, production is not meeting our needs","Many countries are successfully reducing their electricity consumption, while in Slovenia it has increased by almost 30 percent since independence until 2019. On the other hand, in recent years we have not produced enough electricity to cover our own needs. The war in Ukraine has further emphasized the importance of energy efficiency, which can reduce dependence on energy imports, reduce exposure to large fluctuations in energy prices and, last but not least, mitigate climate change and make systems and society more resilient. So what measures do political parties intend to take to rapidly reduce energy consumption?","It has long been clear that switching to renewables alone will not be enough to reduce emissions on the one hand and an uninterrupted electricity supply on the other. Energy efficiency must also be ensured, which means reducing electricity consumption. Some European countries are already doing this successfully.
For example, Denmark is slowly approaching the consumption it had in 1990. At that time, the annual electricity consumption in this country was 30.6 TWh. Then the consumption started to increase and reached its peak in 2006, when they consumed 37.1 TWh of electricity. In the last decade, various measures have managed to reduce consumption to 33.3 TWh (in 2020) or by about 10 percent compared to 2006.
Denmark is also among the leading countries in achieving its goals of zero net CO2 emissions and the transition to renewable energy sources. By 2030, they plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 70 percent compared to 1990 levels. By 2030, they plan to phase out coal-fired electricity production and cover at least half of the country's total energy consumption with renewable energy sources.
In Slovenia, on the other hand, electricity consumption is growing from year to year. In Slovenia, electricity consumption peaked in 2018, when it amounted to 15 TWh. This is almost half of Denmark's consumption, with Denmark having almost three times the population of Slovenia. Then, in 2019, consumption fell to 14.9 TWh, and in the pandemic year 2020, when a large part of the economy stood still, to 14.3 TWh. In 1990, Slovenia consumed about 10.7 TWh of electricity per year. This means that electricity consumption has increased by almost 30 percent since independence.
In the National Action Plan for Renewable Energy Sources until 2020, Slovenia has committed itself to renewable energy sources representing a 25% share in gross final energy consumption by that year. But this goal was achieved only through the statistical transfer of renewable energy from the Czech Republic. The actual share of energy use from renewable energy sources in 2020 in Slovenia was 24.1 percent.
If years ago we produced enough electricity for our own needs, in 2020, according to the annual balance sheet published by the Ministry of Infrastructure, we covered only 92.6 percent of electricity consumption of final customers with domestic production (final customers' consumption amounted to 13.7 TWh). Namely, domestic production contributed only about 12.7 TWh of electricity to the Slovenian electricity system. The trend was even worse last year, as in the first half of 2021 (no data for the whole year) domestic production contributed 6.14 TWh of electricity to the Slovenian electricity system, while the consumption of final customers amounted to 7.09 TWh (four percent). more than in the first half of 2020). In the first half of 2021, Slovenia covered only 87 percent of the electricity consumption of final customers with domestic production.
HOW WOULD POLITICS SOLVE THESE CHALLENGES?
It will be crucial for the sustainability of the system and for the transition to a low-carbon society that, on the one hand, we provide enough (green) electricity and, on the other hand, that we are as energy efficient as possible. So we asked political parties what they will do to change the trend in electricity production and consumption? Experts warn that with the current trend, NEK2 will not be enough to provide the necessary electricity. However, the majority of customers did not answer the specific question of how to reduce electricity consumption or achieve energy efficiency, but set out their plans in the field of energy. So let’s look at how the political parties intend to address this issue and what concrete projects they are planning.
Freedom Movement: We would accelerate the solarization of all relevant areas and support self-sufficiency
The Svoboda Movement says that they are setting ambitious but achievable goals in the field of energy. Among other things, they intend to accelerate investment in renewable energy sources and encourage the development of new technological solutions. They will enable the use of public areas, land and facilities for the promotion of renewable energy sources (RES), with special emphasis on the use of areas adjacent to infrastructure facilities and degraded areas.
""We will remove administrative and procedural obstacles to the further development of renewable energy sources. In dialogue with local communities, we will accelerate the decarbonisation of district heating systems and promote efficient use measures and RES at the local level,"" they wrote. As they pointed out, renewable energy sources have practically unlimited potential both in the production of electricity and in the heating sector. In this way, they are convinced, we can ensure greater energy self-sufficiency and at the same time achieve decarbonisation.
""Renewable and synthetic fuels can play a particularly important role in reducing emissions from transport. Therefore, we will adopt a new law on the priority placement of RES in space, revise energy and environmental legislation to facilitate investment and promote projects on technologies that were in use. We will accelerate the solarization of all relevant areas and support self-sufficiency of all forms with the aim of alleviating energy poverty. By redesigning the electricity distribution system, we will intensify investments in the grid.
They also promise to speed up the implementation of energy efficiency measures, with a special focus on public buildings. They did not explain what specific measures were involved. They added that they would abolish the obligatory connection to the gas network for heating in individual new buildings and intensify the promotion of the replacement of fossil fuel heating devices with RES devices.
They also pointed out that they will ensure greater transparency and better management of public funds intended for measures in the field of climate and energy policies. ""We will overhaul the tax and fiscal policy in the field of fossil energy and renewable resources and green technologies. The profits of state-owned companies will be redirected to new investments in RES. More EU funds will be allocated for the green transition. the projects will ensure greater energy security and greater energy self-sufficiency and independence of our country, and above all the affordability of various energy sources for our citizens, ""they wrote.
They emphasized that these measures would mitigate the effects of rising energy and energy prices on households and the economy resulting from geopolitical instability and other disruptions in global markets. ""In doing so, we will take into account the orientations of the Green Energy Transition. We will help in particular those individuals who are most affected by their social status and those companies that contribute responsibly to development.""
Left: We would strengthen the human and financial strength of the Eco Fund
The Left says that the investments of state energy companies will be directed towards the expansion of capacities for the exploitation of solar, wind and geothermal energy, as well as energy storage facilities. ""We will launch a comprehensive program to build larger solar power plants and roof solarization, which will achieve 10 percent of solar energy in five years. It will include the establishment of a project office for administrative assistance in implementing solar power projects in degraded and industrial environments, apartment buildings and public - owned buildings, co - financing of roof solarization program projects and soft loans for larger solar power plants on industrial, agricultural and public buildings, ""they pointed out.
They predict that they will increase the capacity of the distribution network for the integration of renewable energy sources and expand it with investments for the introduction of smart grids in the electricity distribution system. ""In addition, we will increase funds to improve energy efficiency in households with a scale of progressive subsidies according to the social vulnerability of households. To this end, the human and financial strength of the Eco Fund will be strengthened,"" they said.
They believe that measures to heat buildings will be essential to achieve climate neutrality. “All major new constructions need to be designed for carbon-neutral heating, especially using heat pumps or biomass district heating, where this can be done sustainably,” they concluded.
Marjan Šarc's list: Energy efficiency of buildings is crucial
The LMS focused more on the real issue of how to ensure energy efficiency. As they say, the key challenge is heating and cooling buildings. ""Electricity consumption is increasing because when we give up heating oil for heating, we replace it with heat pumps that run on electricity. In summer, we cool ourselves with electricity,"" they say.
Therefore, they believe that even more money will have to be spent on subsidizing energy efficiency measures in residential buildings, especially thermal insulation. ""Energy efficiency of buildings is the key to the solution. Any investor who would carry out thermal insulation of buildings should get fully reimbursed the value of insulation material. All shopping centers should have on the roofs of solar power plants, especially for cooling electricity in summer. in the future, the role of solar power plants will be particularly important in providing electricity for cooling buildings in the summer, but this cannot be done overnight, ""they wrote.
They also pointed out the fact that the Slovenian economy is very high among EU members in terms of energy intensity. ""This means that energy is a very high item in the price of our products (Talum Kidričevo, iron and steel, paper industry ...), but it does not mean that there is high added value. The economy must develop in the direction of producing products with high added value. value due to the high share of knowledge in the price. Simply put, we need to sell knowledge and not energy, ""they say in LMŠ.
Nova Slovenija: We would speed up the construction of small hydroelectric and wind power plants
The party that makes up the current government coalition says they have already made important moves in the energy sector. They boast about the temporary abolition of network charges and the limitation of contributions and other charges to the lowest possible level, which has led to lower electricity bills for households last month. ""The coalition also introduced an extraordinary restriction on the prices of motor fuels, provided aid to the economy and agriculture, and a solidarity allowance of 150 euros to eliminate the consequences of energy poverty,"" they added.
They stated that studies show that in Slovenia we can provide 8.00 TWh of electricity and heat with a combination of different RES technologies. ""We need to move from words and strategic plans to actions. We need to make it easier to place RES investments in space and support the development of electricity storage systems (storage facilities). We support the construction of a chain of power plants on the lower and middle Sava. on Slovenian rivers and watercourses, ""they said.
As they pointed out, Slovenia is at the bottom of European countries in terms of wind energy use. ""The total energy potential from wind energy is estimated at 303 to 480 MWh. In Nova Slovenija, we are convinced that wind farms can be installed in space in a sustainable way and reach the potential,"" they say.
Recognizing that we all need to become part of a green future, they are proposing financial schemes that allow investment in RES so that savings or revenues cover the investment. ""We propose the continuation of the policy of incentives for citizens and households for the construction of RES energy facilities, the purchase of vehicles with alternative power sources, the construction of energy-efficient buildings, the replacement of heating systems,"" they added.
However, each individual can do a lot, they emphasized. ""We have to start with small steps in our own household, turning off the lights every time we leave the room. We can also save energy by buying energy-saving light bulbs, which are five times more energy efficient, and by buying more energy-efficient household appliances. ""They have an energy-saving label A. The washing machine in this energy class uses half as much energy as a standard washing machine. Analyzes show that completely switching off electronic devices can save up to 10 percent on electricity bills,"" they wrote.
Let's connect Slovenia: Geothermal energy, wood biomass, wind, sun must be used ...
In their short answer, the party Connect Slovenia says that we have ""once again been given the opportunity to thoroughly reflect on missed energy strategies, including at the EU level"". They emphasize that dependence on fossil fuels is not the answer. “We need to find sustainable resources that put minimal strain on the environment and future generations,” they are clear.
But what solutions do they suggest? ""Short-term: diversification. Medium-term: reflection on NEK2 if we want to keep prices low and the economy competitive. For long-term sustainability, we will launch projects to exploit Slovenia's energy potential: geothermal energy, wood biomass, wind, sun, micro-hydropower plants,"" they said. sail.
Slovenian Democratic Party: Emphasis on greater utilization of water resources and domestic wood biomass
The largest government party also gave a short and concise answer: ""In the SDS, we are committed to the stability and self-sufficiency of electricity supply, which can be provided in the future according to the formula: 1/3 to 1/2 needs nuclear energy, 1/3 needs solar, wind and geothermal energy and 1/3 of the hydropower needs. ""
As they wrote, in their energy policy, ""the emphasis will be on greater utilization of water resources and domestic wood biomass for environmentally friendly and affordable energy supply."" They see renewable energy as an important element of a ""reliable, secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy"".
However, in order to ensure competitive supply, priority would be given to ""those renewables which do not impose additional financial burdens on the population and the economy due to support schemes"".
Social Democrats: Increased investment in changing consumer patterns and accelerating the transition to RES
The SD says that subsidies will give priority to the use of efficient products for lower and more efficient consumption of electricity. And this in all areas of operation. The input will also be greater for changing consumer patterns and at the macro level, with an accelerated transition to renewables. This, as they say, would gradually ensure energy sustainability in Slovenia. We will also advocate the withdrawal of fossil fuels from the energy balance (especially coal), provide appropriate development funds and programs aimed at the gradual transformation of individual regions, which today are predominantly energy-intensive and will lose competitiveness in the future without systemic Therefore, the energy transition must be coordinated not only with the environmental aspect (lower CO2 emissions), but also with the social, fiscal and other aspects, ""they stressed.
They are convinced that Slovenia's national energy and climate plan and energy concept need to be updated. ""Degraded areas in Slovenia must be identified and used for solar power plants and solar heating plants with heat storage facilities. The state must encourage the adaptation of local production and local consumption, including the installation of storage tanks, and encourage larger facilities in locations where they can be connected to network, ""the party wrote.
""We will recapitalize the Eco Fund and provide it with additional resources of new EU financial mechanisms for green investments by obtaining favorable sources on domestic financial and capital sources, including by issuing bonds. We will increase the available grants and soft loans to finance energy rehabilitation and installations of renewable technologies We will encourage the development of electricity self-sufficiency of the population, community, economy and public sector, promote the potential of geothermal energy and biomass, support cogeneration of heat and electricity and reduce emissions of harmful substances with more environmentally friendly energy sources and modern heating devices, ""they enumerated.
The SD also believes that the potential of hydroelectric power plants should be further exploited: ""It will be necessary to complete the Lower Sava chain, build the Middle Sava chain, install and build pumped storage hydropower plants as energy storage facilities."" However, they are also convinced that climate goals and, at the same time, energy independence will be difficult to achieve without nuclear energy. ""However, we believe that this is such an important and long-term decision that it must be adopted in a referendum after an in-depth and thorough public debate,"" they added.
Alenka Bratušek's client: upgrade and renovation of the electricity distribution network
The SAB party proposes the establishment of the 3rd energy pillar for the accelerated construction of green energy production facilities, especially for the use of sun and wind. ""With a special law, we will establish a company and grant it a concession, which will accelerate the construction of green energy production facilities. The law will determine the regions, areas and land where large production capacities can be built quickly and even exceed the set goals. THESE, ""they wrote in their response.
They are also convinced that a lot of attention will have to be paid to the upgrade and renewal of the electricity distribution network, so that this will support active customers and the green transformation of the economy. ""At SAB, we will also promote self-sufficiency in electricity (energy from solar power plants) and sufficiently stimulate the establishment of energy storage facilities,"" they said.
The Alenka Bratušek Party also proposes that a consultative referendum be held before the construction of the second block of the JEK. ""With the consent of the citizens, we will support the construction of a nuclear power plant in the form of modular construction of blocks, ie small power plants that can be upgraded according to energy needs,"" they concluded.

Who is Viktor Medvedchuk?
Medvedchuk is otherwise known for having close relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Among other things, Putin is his daughter's godfather, and according to the Washington Post, he and Putin are also vacationing and watching Formula One races and martial arts competitions.
According to media reports, Medvedchuk has been able to establish himself as one of Ukraine's biggest political influencers over the past three decades because of his ties to Putin. As a result, he also became quite wealthy. Last year, Forbes magazine estimated it to be worth $ 620 million (about $ 570 million).
If Russia successfully occupies Ukraine, Medvedchuk's opposition party, the Platform for Life, could form a government that is more in line with the Kremlin's wishes, the Washington Post reports. Although Medvedchuk has repeatedly denied that his party is pro-Russian, he openly advocates closer political and economic ties with Moscow.
However, Medvedčuk was also mentioned at a session of the parliamentary commission of inquiry into alleged illegal financing of the SDS on Tuesday."

According to unofficial information, according to unofficial information, the police are also conducting covert investigative measures against former politician Sebastjan Jeretič, but he was informed about the police investigation, which was done by one of the prosecutors of the Specialized State Prosecutor's Office. They do not reveal who the prosecutor is. Jeretic says he knows nothing about the investigation.","According to TV Slovenia, this is a notorious story about the alleged black construction of Vitoslav Türk's family on the coast, which underwent various inspection procedures years ago. Tine Türk confirmed to them that they had received various inappropriate offers on how to legalize illegal construction, and that there had been a number of different acts which he considered criminal because they demanded that he act contrary to laws. All of these proposals had a common denominator - someone needs to be bribed, he said. Asked by a journalist whether Sebastjan Jeretič was among them, Türk replied: ""I have talked to many people, I would not comment on cases where cases have not yet been concluded, because I cannot confirm or deny these things.""
Sebastjan Jeretič told TV Slovenija: ""I know Tine and we drank coffee a few times. I don't know about the investigation because I had no influence on the case. At most I advised him not to talk to local criminals.""
Asked again whether he reported Jeretic, Tine Türk said that he had forwarded all the conversations, which very seriously suggested concrete bribes. He did not want to speak in more detail.

Did the prosecutor inform Jeretic that he was being investigated by the police?
The National Television Prosecutor's Office also confirmed to the Specialized State Prosecutor's Office that the police investigation had been compromised and that covert investigative measures had been revealed, explaining that prosecutor Mateja Gončin had taken immediate action when they found out. We clarify that after the measures were disclosed, the state prosecutor initiated proceedings against an unknown person, given that she did not know who and from whom obtained this information about the covert measures and in what way. For the protection of personal data. we cannot provide you with more information, ""the prosecutor's office said. However, according to Carlova, one of the prosecutors at the SDT made sure that Jeretič was informed that he was under the scrutiny of the Police. Asked whether he had been informed that the police investigation had fallen into the water, Tine Türk replied that no one had officially informed him, but that he could conclude from the events that this had happened. ""Because certain conversations were very concrete and could have resulted in some investigations, but that didn't happen - so either everyone is innocent or something is not working in the system.""
Last year, an SDT employee was arrested for allegedly leaking confidential information to criminals
At the end of last year, the Police arrested an employee of the Specialized State Prosecutor's Office, who allegedly delivered confidential and secret information about investigations to suspects and members of criminal groups. According to the Police, it allegedly caused incalculable damage to the criminal investigations, as it allegedly disclosed information about planned house searches and covert investigative measures, such as wiretapping and secret surveillance. The employee had access to the most confidential information about police investigations.
As prosecutors were quite shocked after the revelation that their colleague was allegedly supplying criminals with data from investigations, many things were heard at the prosecutor's office after this event. Thus, the journalist Carlova also received information about the compromised investigation against Jeretič, even though she is several years old and is not related to this particular employee of the Specialized State Prosecutor's Office, who was arrested. According to unofficial information, the prosecutor's office only later found out that one of the prosecutors had informed Jeretič about the investigation, although they had not officially confirmed this for national television."

He is accused of resisting state authorities. He had to spend the night at the police station, said lawyer Vadim Prokhorov.","News of Monday's arrest of 40-year-old Vladimir Kara-Murza came to light shortly after an interview in which an opposition politician opposed Russian President Vladimir Putin's military campaign, the independent newspaper The Moscow Times reported.
""I have no doubt that Putin's regime will end because of this war in Ukraine,"" Kara-Murza told CNN, according to The Moscow Times.
The 40-year-old was denied access to a lawyer, according to the independent police surveillance website OVD-Info The Moscow Times. They later added that Kara-Murza was detained overnight for allegedly disobeying police orders.
Kara-Murza has barely survived the mysterious poisoning twice already
The opposition leader blamed Russian intelligence for the poisonings in 2015 and 2017. Russian authorities have denied the poisoning, which Russian doctors claimed originated from ""unidentified substances"", according to The Moscow Times.
According to the findings of the Bellingcat investigation group, the policy was pursued by FSB agents, who are allegedly also involved in the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern over the arrest on Twitter. ""We are closely monitoring the situation and demand an immediate release,"" he wrote."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/revscina.html,More and more poor people in Slovenia. How will the parties deal with this?,"Slovenia is one of the seven countries in the European Union in which the at-risk-of-poverty rate rose in 2020 compared to 2019. The covida-19 pandemic has deepened the plight of the most vulnerable groups and, above all, has shown other systemic weaknesses. The European Anti-Poverty Network warns that the eradication of poverty is a political decision, so we were interested in what measures the parties will take in relation to this pressing issue.","The at-risk-of-poverty rate in Slovenia in 2020 increased by 0.4 percentage points compared to the previous year and amounted to 12.4 percent. The annual at-risk-of-poverty threshold rose by € 424 to € 8,864 or € 739 per month. This means that approximately 254,000 people in Slovenia lived on an income below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, which is approximately 11,000 more than in 2019.
According to the National Statistical Office (SURS), 97,000 or 19.5 percent of all pensioners, 46,000 or five percent of all persons in employment, 41,000 or 10.5 percent of minors, 38,000 or 43.4 percent of the unemployed and 32,000 others or 19 , 6 percent of all incapable of work, housewives, students and other inactive people.
Social transfers, including pensions, are an important factor in reducing poverty in Slovenia. According to SORS, the at-risk-of-poverty rate would be 22.4% if social transfers (family and social benefits) were not included in income. If pensions were deducted from income, the at-risk-of-poverty rate would rise to 39.4 percent. The socially vulnerable in Slovenia are also assisted by numerous humanitarian organizations, including ZPM Ljubljana Moste-Polje, which, as part of the Chain of Good People project, provides comprehensive assistance to the socially vulnerable, including teaching about money management.
Many experts point out that one of the main ways out of poverty, both generational and situational, is financial literacy. It is an essential life skill that is the basis for informed decisions. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines it as a combination of awareness, knowledge, skills, behavior and behavior necessary for making financial decisions and achieving the financial well-being of the individual. According to the OECD, financial literacy has three components: financial knowledge, financial behavior and an attitude towards longer-term financial planning.
The level of financial literacy in Slovenia is low among the young population, as they do not know and monitor their financial situation and ultimately do not plan what will happen to their finances, according to an international OECD survey. Joanne Li, a former dean and professor of finance at the University of Florida, stresses the need to invest in educating young people to develop this skill set, as financial literacy strengthens society. Learning financial literacy should therefore start early, as the level of education is strongly linked to financial literacy, he emphasizes.
The European Anti-Poverty Network warns that eradicating poverty is a political decision. So what can we expect? Will the at-risk-of-poverty rate in Slovenia only increase or can we expect political decision-makers to take concrete steps in the fight against poverty? We asked the parties to which the latest opinion polls show the best in the upcoming parliamentary elections what five concrete steps they will take to address this pressing issue. How will they address the issue of generational poverty? Why is money management or financial literacy not part of the education program and do they intend to change that?
The Freedom movement plans to introduce a universal basic income
The Svoboda Movement believes that an adequate response to the challenges of poverty, especially generational ones, must be provided by a modern, transparent and efficient social protection system. The measures should be targeted at those social groups in which the risk of poverty is most pronounced, they explain, so they plan to introduce a universal basic income (UBI) for children and young people, pensioners and the long-term unemployed. According to them, the UBI could cover all children and parents would no longer have to prove their entitlement to it, as is the case now, e.g. in the case of child allowances, or to recalculate the prices of school lunches and lunch and to deal with whether their children will be able to take part in school trips and school in nature. In addition, the administrative work of state institutions would be eliminated. ""In doing so, we should consider which social allowances are abolished with the introduction of UBI for children and which should remain due to the specific situation of individual children,"" they explain. In their opinion, UBI is also a solution for the elderly or retirees. These could solve the plight of most retirees, from poverty to the issue of paying for home care, and for some it would also enable activities in old age that they cannot afford. It would also facilitate the financial situation of children who have to take care of their elderly parents.
""The Svoboda Movement will also examine the possibility of introducing UBI in the long-term unemployed group, as we find that active and passive employment policy measures do not work in this group, as the long-term unemployed are only exceptionally included in the labor market. and financial resources, ""they add. As they say, the pension must enable a decent life, so it must not be lower than 10 percent above the poverty line. In their opinion, material and infrastructural (housing) independence of young people is also important for the prevention of generational poverty. Financial literacy and entrepreneurship (self-initiative, creativity, creativity and empowerment) must become one of the key goals of education, which should be understood as a competence of personal development, they emphasize, so they will integrate it into the entire educational vertical and empower students knowledge and skills that they will be able to use after finishing school.
Left against financial literacy
In order to eradicate poverty from the existing system of cash social benefits, Levica intends to gradually develop a system of basic income, which will not be a substitute but a supplement to quality free universal public services. They also say that they will immediately recalculate the minimum cost of living, which is the basis for determining the amount of social transfers and the minimum wage. This should be gradually raised to at least € 1,000 net. The Left also says that, following the example of the Minimum Wage Act, the basic amounts of cash social assistance will be tied to the amount of the minimum cost of living; they plan to increase the basic amount of cash social assistance and childcare allowance to at least 613 euros from 1 January next year. ""We will raise the minimum unemployment benefit to the current minimum wage, which currently stands at 1,074.43 euros gross. We will strengthen the welfare state system (public health, education, pension system), which will provide all citizens, regardless of wallet thickness, with quality public services, ""they add.
They promise to intervene in the issue of intergenerational poverty with family policy, which will be aimed at the systemic recognition of poverty and its intergenerational dimensions. They want to ensure that all children, including those from poor and neglected backgrounds, have the most equal opportunities in life. They also want to raise the minimum pensions: ""We will raise the minimum, early, old-age and disability pensions to a decent level, and the guaranteed full-time pension above the at-risk-of-poverty threshold (750 euros)."" It should also be ensured that the new guaranteed old-age pension will be taken into account in the assessment of widows 'and survivors' pensions and in the assessment of disability insurance benefits. ""We will permanently abolish the repayment of social assistance, childcare allowance and exemption from social security services and other social transfers, thus preventing the confiscation of property of the deceased before they can leave it to their descendants,"" they promise, adding that they will also abolish child support. parents, which is a condition for obtaining childcare allowance and assistance in paying for home care and causes the inheritance of poverty from one generation to another.
The Left does not agree with the explanation that the cause of poverty in Slovenia is the lack of financial literacy or the fact that poor individuals have deficient skills in handling money. According to them, the cause of poverty is class divisions in society, large wealth disparities and low wages, pensions, scholarships and cash social assistance. ""Money management and financial literacy are not essential elements of the education system. In the Left we oppose the tendency to instrumentalize knowledge and adapt curricula to market needs. Instead of the values ​​of autonomy and critical thinking, the educational process as individual investments in so-called human capital, ""they say, stressing that social policy must aim to eradicate poverty and help vulnerable members of society, not to provide cheap labor. ""Therefore, we oppose the subordination of social policy to neoliberal economic policy. Its basic premise is that poverty and unemployment are individual, not structural or social problems of capitalism. Education and training must be planned professionally, with the aim of developing each individual in accordance with his or her interests and abilities, and must be equally accessible to all, regardless of social status. position, origin and place of residence, and they must be guided by social needs, not the needs of markets and capital or particular political beliefs, ""they say in the Left.
LMŠ for the earliest possible inclusion of young people in the labor market
The LMŠ explains that immediate measures to reduce poverty include raising the minimum wage, reducing or eliminating unnecessary budget expenditures enacted by the current government, and at the same time strengthening the revenue side of the budget (including amendments to the Personal Income Tax Act, but not unnecessary reductions in the taxation of dividends, interest, profits and letting of real estate). Only in this way, in their opinion, will we strengthen the welfare state so that it can help the poor with social transfers. ""At the same time, decent pensions must be provided. The program predicts that they will increase at least to the at-risk-of-poverty threshold of 738 euros per month,"" they say. As they add, in order for old age to be decent, it is necessary to act holistically. Thus, they intend to integrate young people into the labor market as soon as possible, adapt jobs to the elderly, strengthen added value, establish an effective demographic fund and encourage contributions to the 2nd and 3rd pension pillars, of course for those who can. ""We will listen to the plight of the elderly and together ensure a dignified old age. We will promote the employment of the elderly, increase affordable capacities in nursing homes and provide stable financial resources for efficient home care. The long-term care system will become a new pillar of the welfare state."" They emphasize that financial literacy of the population is a special aspect of money management and, consequently, of solving the problem of poverty, ""so it is essential that this becomes part of educational programs for all generations"".
NSi believes that money management should become part of the curriculum
NSi says that in the last two years they have already taken and are still taking many measures that contribute to reducing the risk of poverty. Thus, pensions between December 2020 and February 2022 increased by 10.3 percent to 13 percent (depending on the year of retirement) due to the adopted legislation in the field of pensions and regular and extraordinary adjustments, while the guaranteed pension increased by as much as 17.6 percent . “It is also essential that the lowest peasant, disability, widow’s and survivors’ pensions have risen significantly, ”they add. Otherwise, the issue of generational poverty in NSi is being addressed within the package of family and social legislation submitted to the parliamentary procedure. ""Through various measures, we encourage parents to have their children complete primary school and then enroll in secondary school. Education is a fundamental condition for a child to be able to enter the labor market later, stand on their own two feet and emerge from the negative spiral of intergenerational poverty."" they explain. According to them, in dealing with vulnerable groups of people with various barriers, they enable cooperation between social work centers, humanitarian organizations and the Employment Service, so that people with various social programs are empowered enough to enter the labor market and they take care of themselves and their family. ""For vulnerable groups of the long-term unemployed, we provide a longer period of inclusion in the public works program, as they have more employment opportunities. As part of the comprehensive reform envisaged in our government's 2022-2026 education program, we believe that with money and financial literacy become part of the curriculum throughout the educational vertical, ”they add.
Let's connect Slovenia for Slovenia, in which no one is left behind
The main policy of the Connect Slovenia movement is that they want a Slovenia in which no one is left behind, they emphasize. According to them, the best social measure is employment opportunities that provide fair pay for fair work, and on the other hand, the state, which does not restrict individuals in developing their talents. ""However, given the current needs of the labor market, those who want to work would be able to work without losing the benefits of pension protection. With a focus on the private sector - in the public sector, the current way of retirement should be maintained."" According to them, the reform should include a provision that widows and widowers should retain such a share of their partner's pension after the loss of their partner that they can ensure a decent life. The Connect Slovenia movement also believes that money management or financial literacy should be part of the educational program, and they will strive for that.
SAB against the privatization of education
SAB agrees that financial literacy and money management should be part of the educational process, recognizing that only a strong and stable economy is a guarantee of a strong welfare state, higher wages and pensions, and less poverty. ""Public education is a path to knowledge for all and it is a foundation that also enables a better life for all, regardless of their social status. Therefore, we will never allow the privatization of education. Knowledge must remain accessible to all under equal conditions,"" they stressed. As they further explain, the professional work of the centers for social work needs to be debureaucratized, upgraded and strengthened on the ground. ""We will overhaul the mechanisms and control of the provision of social assistance. Those in need must receive support, and the able-bodied must find work. We will strengthen public works and employment opportunities,"" they promise. According to them, the level of the minimum wage should protect workers from exploitation and ensure normal survival. Contract workers must be equal to full-time employees when they start work. For equal work, everyone should be paid equally, they add.
SD for a minimum pension of 700 euros
The Social Democrats believe that social transfers are still an important factor in reducing the risk of poverty, so they propose a minimum pension of 700 euros for a full pension period, at least 800 euros minimum wage, abolition of minimum wage supplements, wider availability of care allowance for all recipients of minimum pensions , and amendments to the provisions of the Pension and Disability Insurance Act. These will improve the situation of recipients of widows' pensions, who according to research are a poor and vulnerable group. Regarding the inclusion of financial literacy in educational programs, the SD believes that new societal challenges do not need to be addressed by expanding the curriculum, but by integrating new topics, phenomena, trends and values ​​into educational processes. “All of these circumstances represent the context of education, and individual content can be integrated into the educational process through good collaboration with teaching staff,” they say.
SDS for housing, adequate employment and pay for young people
The SDS emphasizes that in this term of office they took care of raising the basic salary, the minimum disability pension, disability benefits for certain categories, guaranteed pensions and assessment percentages, and equalization for men and women. ""We have taken a number of measures to promote fertility in the field of family policy, regularly and extraordinarily (retroactively and ongoing) harmonized pensions, increased cash social assistance and childcare allowance,"" they explained, adding that all this significantly reduces generational poverty. However, they predict that in the future, in addition to the above, they will also provide housing, suitable employment and payment for young people. Regarding financial literacy, they say that it is already part of the educational program in primary schools, only that it is included in subjects with a different name (eg household in primary schools). ""Certainly, it would be advisable to pay more attention to this topic in the future, perhaps also in the form of a special subject or educational seminars at all educational levels,"" they added.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/us-razveljavilo-dolocbo-o-dvigu-placnega-stropa-za-zdravnike-in-zobozdravnike.html,The Constitutional Court annulled the provision on raising the salary ceiling for doctors,"The Constitutional Court repealed Article 48 of the Tenth Intervention Act (PKP10), which would increase the highest salary grade for doctors and dentists that can be achieved in the public sector wage system. Among other things, it considered that the challenged provision, which encroaches on the foundations of the single wage system, is not a necessary measure to eliminate the consequences of the covida-19 epidemic. Fidesz has reacted sharply: this will further strengthen their demand for exit from the single wage system in the public sector and will have to happen much sooner than if the article were not repealed.","The last anti-crown intervention law was passed at the end of last year. For doctors and dentists, by the end of 2022, it had raised the pay ceiling by six grades, to 63rd grade.
The request to review the constitutionality of raising the salary ceiling was submitted to the Constitutional Court as voters by the presidents of five trade union centers, namely Branimir Štrukelj, Jakob Počivavšek, Lidija Jerkič, Evelin Vesenjak and Peter Majcen.
They claimed that Article 90 of the Constitution on the Legislative Referendum had been violated in the process of adopting the law, because the impugned article of the intervention law does not constitute an urgent measure to eliminate the consequences of covida-19 and therefore does not fall within the scope of the intervention law. In their opinion, the National Assembly should not adopt a decision on the inadmissibility of a referendum on the disputed provision.
As can be seen from the decision published today, the constitutional judges found that the mass outbreak of covida-19, even if no epidemic has been officially declared, constitutes a natural disaster. Therefore, the intervention law, which is the legal basis for urgent measures to ensure the elimination of the consequences of covida-19, is one of the exceptions for which it is not permissible to call a legislative referendum under Article 90 of the Constitution.
However, according to the constitutional judges, the impugned provision, which would interfere with the Public Sector Wage System Act by raising the salary grades for all doctors and dentists and thus interfere with the foundations of the unified civil service pay system and destroy the situation, is not a necessary measure. which would address the consequences of covida-19.
At the same time, the Constitutional Court rejected the allegations of the National Assembly and the government that the harmful consequences of covida-19 are also a reduction in the number of doctors and that the challenged measure is intended to help young doctors in particular. It found that such departure or. The shortage of doctors as low salaries for young doctors is clearly not related to the mass phenomenon of covida-19, but ""is due to long-standing dissatisfaction of doctors with the pay system and other working conditions, as well as other factors such as doctor education policy, specialization, etc."" .
""In addition, the possibility of increasing the salaries of young doctors does not depend on the contested measure, as it allows for an increase in the highest medical salaries. measures to prevent the spread, mitigate, control, recover and eliminate the consequences of covida-19, ""they wrote.
Two months ago, the constitutional judges suspended the implementation of the assessed provision until the final decision, as they assessed that the implementation of a possibly unconstitutional disputed article would cause more serious harmful consequences.
The last intervention anti-crown law (PKP 10) was adopted at the end of last year. For doctors and dentists, by the end of 2022, it had raised the pay ceiling by six grades, to 63rd grade. As is well known, the agreement to raise the salaries of doctors has put other unions in the public sector on their feet. These require equal treatment, ie to raise the salaries of all public sector employees by six grades. This request was handed over to the Minister of Public Administration Boštjan Koritnik, who pointed out that such an increase in salaries for 188,000 employees in the public sector would mean 1.5 billion euros a year, which is not in line with the government's starting point. sustainability of public finances.
Responses from unions
The Confederation of Public Sector Trade Unions of Slovenia is not surprised by the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Slovenia, which annulled Article 48 of the PKP10 and thus raised the salary ceiling only for doctors and dentists. of the Intervention Act reminded that raising the highest salary grade for only one salary subgroup is not a necessary measure to eliminate the consequences of Covid-19 and that it means unequal treatment of civil servants. five presidents of trade union centers, with the first signatory Branimir Štrukl, president of the KSJS, filed a request to assess the constitutionality of the said provision of the intervention law. the last two years.If the rulers respected the fundamental principles of the social part and the harmonization of laws would take place before the discussion in the government and in the National Assembly, such risks would not arise. ""
The KSJS expects the future government to start negotiations on public sector wages immediately, which will establish appropriate wage relations - with an emphasis on the lower third of the wage scale. They also expect the re-establishment of the Economic and Social Council, which will be based on an equal dialogue between the social partners and the government. Only in this way will it be possible to avoid the need to submit requests for the assessment of constitutionality, which are one of the means of trade unions, when there is no proper dialogue with the authorities, they wrote in the response.
According to the president of the Association of Free Trade Unions of Slovenia (ZSSS), Lidija Jerkič, the decision of the constitutional judges is expected. ""The Constitutional Court has shown that even if you have power in your hands, the rules of the rule of law still apply,"" she added. As she reminded in a statement for STA, the Constitutional Court had already assessed the retirement of older workers after the seventh anti-crown package that an arrangement had been adopted that was not related to the epidemic situation, but a systemic intervention in legislation.
Also, the tenth intervention law, in her words, was adopted in a ""eye-catching"" way, ie without public discussion or consultations with the social partners. ""In addition, this is legislation related to the ban on referendums, which means that it cannot be removed from the council except by a decision of the Constitutional Court. Our constitutional review has gone in the direction of adopting the law. Doctors can change salaries in legislation it regulates this and is systemic, with the negotiations and procedures envisaged there. The attack was not on the amount of doctors' salaries, but on the method of reception, ""she stressed.
In this mandate, social dialogue is no longer expected in the ZSSS. ""If he has not revived so far - one year since the end - he will not be in these 14 days. However, situations such as this one when the concrete provision is repealed are the result of a lack of dialogue. such constitutional reviews, there would be no such upheavals, there would be no such deviations from the way laws are passed. Decisions would be considered and the Constitutional Court would have significantly less work than it has now, ""the trade unionist added.
In a response to STA, the President of the Confederation of Trade Unions of Slovenia Pergam, Jakob Počivavšek, welcomed the decision of the Constitutional Court and described it as expected. As he wrote, the decision confirmed, among other things, that it is problematic to interfere in the single wage system beyond the procedure set by the Public Sector Wage System Act, that health problems last longer than the covida-19 epidemic and are not related to wages alone. , but they are much more complex and that the government 's action does not solve the problem of young doctors at all, which was ""the declared goal"".
""We also welcome the fact that the Constitutional Court, with decisions such as the one in question, sets clear standards as to what is permissible to include in intervention legislation and what is not, given that direct democracy is limited in adopting such legislation,"" he said. added.
Fides: For an efficient and accessible public health system, the new government will have to carry out wage reform immediately after the elections
The Fides union of doctors and dentists emphasizes that the new government, which wants to provide citizens with an efficient and accessible public health system, will have to carry out pay reform immediately after the elections. Otherwise, the Slovenian health care system will continue on its way to a final breakdown, the union is convinced. In doing so, they responded to the decision of the Constitutional Court to repeal Article 48 of the Tenth Intervention Act, which would raise the highest salary grade for doctors and dentists.
As they wrote in Fidesz, the repeal of the mentioned article further strengthened them in the demand for the withdrawal of doctors and dentists from the single salary system in the public sector. However, the withdrawal will have to happen much earlier than if the article had not been repealed. “The anomalies of the current evaluation of medical work, which the 10th Anti-Crown Law has tried to partially mitigate, are unbearable,” they stressed.
They warned that immediately after the elections, the government will face ""an extremely demanding task of salary reform, which will bring the remuneration of health care workers closer to the arrangements of efficient health systems in Western Europe, with the task of keeping doctors in the public health system.
According to them, the trends in wage ratios confirm that Slovenian doctors and dentists are at the very tail end of European countries in relation to the average wage. They added that in recent years we have been lagging behind the less developed Central and Eastern European countries.
The reward system in Slovenia was assessed as ""the biggest cancer of our healthcare"" and the main reason why both the most experienced doctors, on whom the treatment of the most demanding patients is based, and the youngest, on whom the future of Slovenian healthcare is based, are leaving public health. ""The fact that rewarding doctors in Slovenia is completely inadequate is also confirmed by the fact that we are unable to attract almost any doctor from less developed countries, let alone from EU countries, to practice medicine in our country,"" they wrote.
They added that nowhere in Europe, except in Slovenia, are doctors in the same pay system as the state administration. According to Fidesz, even the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia cites a rigid wage policy in the public sector as a key systemic problem in health care."

""Both politicians are deliberately undermining the country's hard-won peace.

Dodik has already responded to the sanctions, saying Britain has never had good intentions towards Republika Srpska and its people. He also described the sanctions as ridiculous, as he has no property in Great Britain and has not visited it for ten years, reports the Serbian news agency Tanjug.
Fears of destabilization have increased in BiH in recent months due to threats of secession. The British authorities accuse Dodik of using the war in Ukraine to promote Russian policy and working for the disintegration of BiH, allegedly cooperating with Moscow.
Sanctions against the Bosnian Serb leader and the related television network for endangering the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire region were imposed by the United States in early January this year.
In February, the President of the Republika Srpska said that Serbs were disappointed by the international community's constant efforts to destroy their identity. Cvijanovic has also repeatedly threatened to secede, hoping the Bosnian Supreme Court would get rid of foreign judges.
In addition to two Croats, two Muslims and two Serbs, the court also has three foreign judges, a legacy of the Dayton Peace Accords, which ended the 1992-1995 war and divided BiH along ethnic borders."

Problems have accumulated, and a pandemic that has increased distress has finally exposed a malfunctioning system. The lack of staff and capacity on the one hand, and the great increase in needs on the other, mean that even politics can no longer turn a blind eye to the situation that has arisen. The measures already taken, many warn, are far from enough.","""We have from two hundred to three hundred and sixty percent more emergency referrals than we had before the epidemic,"" our interlocutor, Associate Professor, told us in mid-January. prof. dr. Hojka Gregorič Kumperščak, child psychiatrist and head of the Unit for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at the University Medical Center Maribor.
He and his colleagues noted that only in the field of children and adolescents did the situation worsen - in the field of anxiety, depression and eating disorders, they also recorded an increase of about 40%, and the presence of suicidal thoughts in adolescents increased sharply.
The pressure on patients was so severe that they had to drastically reduce bed rest, which of course means harm to the patient, and patients found it harder to reach a specialist outside the hospital, which sent many straight into the arms of gurus - inadequately educated, self-proclaimed therapists. services are mostly offered through social networks.
At the end of the month, almost immediately before the elections, the government then adopted an action plan for 2022 and 2023 to implement the resolution on the national mental health program 2018-2028.
It focuses on the mental health of children and adolescents aged 14 to 25 - Health Minister Janez Poklukar explained that 50 percent of mental disorders and distress occur in children under 14 and 75 percent under 25.
Funds in the amount of 31 million euros have been earmarked for the action plan, but staffing is an even bigger problem than the money itself.
The field of mental health is so far from orderly in our country. We therefore asked the political parties how to solve the biggest dilemmas in the field of mental health, in what time period they would regulate the field of psychological care providers, how and in what time to provide adequate staff for mental health centers, as well as how to address the challenge. the harmful effects of modern technology on the mental health of young people?
Many cite mental health centers as a solution, but it is worth noting that they are facing severe staff shortages.
Freedom Movement: The area of ​​psychological care providers needs to be prioritized
The Freedom Movement says mental disorders are one of the major public health problems. ""Priority must be given to the optimal implementation of the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program, which is valid for the period up to 2028.""
They also announce that, in accordance with their general guidelines regarding the implementation of the decisions of the Constitutional Court, they will immediately amend the Mental Health Act accordingly.
""We will establish professional supervision of mental health service providers. We will ensure better supervision of psychotherapeutic service providers and consider stricter licensing conditions following the example of other Western countries, such as Austria, France or Germany. Psychotherapeutic and psychosocial counseling activities should be professionalized accordingly. with the medical paradigm and taking into account the concept of integrative medicine, ""they promise and say that the field of psychological care providers needs to be prioritized, as the epidemic in this area leaves the most negative consequences, with special emphasis on children and adolescents.
""We will organize a network of mental health centers where the general population will have easier access to psychiatric specialists, clinical psychologists, licensed psychotherapists and psychosocial counselors. The goal of the network is to significantly reduce inequalities in regional access to mental health care, especially for vulnerable groups such as children and adolescents. and the elderly, ”they promise. Many such centers are already operating, but the problem is staffing, experts warn.
""Among the opportunities, we also see the involvement of specialists in psychiatry and clinical psychology to solve mental disorders in adolescents and young adults,"" the Svoboda Movement is considering solutions. ""We will train additional medical staff and raise awareness among young people about the importance of mental health. We will introduce psychological counseling for psychology students in colleges under the appropriate supervision of mentors,"" they added.
""It is necessary to provide systematic funding for specializations in clinical psychology and provide funding for at least 30 specialists a year. To this end, we will eliminate queues at psychologists, clinical psychologists and child psychiatrists as soon as possible and provide additional specializations for these professions,"" they promise.
What about the harmful effects of modern technology? ""They need to be neutralized through quality programs and a wide-ranging public network of mental health services and services, which is national capital and as such must undoubtedly be strengthened.""
Left: The issue of mental health is not exclusively related to the health system, but it is also a question of what kind of society we want to live in
""According to all data, the mental health situation was catastrophic even before the coronavirus epidemic,"" the Left warns. Studies by the National Institute of Public Health found that the existing public health network was not in line with the actual mental health needs of children and adolescents before the epidemic: ""Between the seven years between 2008 and 2015, Children and adolescents due to mental and behavioral disorders at the secondary level increased by a terrible 71 percent. Epidemic and restrictive measures only worsened the situation. . ""
""A concrete plan in this area needs to be drawn up on the basis of the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program adopted in 2018, which has not been done so far or has been done to a limited extent. for mental health did not become operational until July 2021, three years after the adoption of the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program? ""
According to the Left, the field of mental health needs to be comprehensively regulated within the public system: ""The accessibility of public providers needs to be increased and more attention paid to prevention programs and activities. it is clear that special efforts need to be made in the call for applications and to offer incentives for this type of employment. ""
They also see at least part of the solution in prevention: ""As in health in general, prevention is crucial in mental health. The Left program offers clear and decisive answers in this regard. Precarious employment relationships, unresolved housing issues, working beyond working hours and the fact that employees are available practically all the time has a strong impact on people's mental health. Thus, the issue of mental health is not only linked to the health system, but also to the kind of society we want to live in. ""
As they point out, they are aware of the harmful effects of modern technology: technology should serve the needs of people, not show wealth and other differences among the youngest, and that the formation of personality and the growth of the individual is linked to the pressures they experience on private social networks aimed solely at making a profit. recognize the impact of different types of platforms on the mental health of children and adolescents and, more broadly, on public (mental) health and regulate their activities in accordance with the public interest. ""
LMŠ: Establishment of a mental health service or directorate within the Ministry of Health The LMŠ warns that the negative effects of the epidemic on mental health will remain after it has passed: ""Data and statistics from the United Nations and the World Economic Forum show more than 200 people have died from the virus due to various forms of mental disorders (pre-existing mental patients are not included in the statistics). additional burdens on the mental health care system, which was already severely malnourished in Slovenia before the outbreak. ""
According to them, in order to improve the situation in the field of mental health care for the population, a series of urgent measures in the field of economic, social, educational and health policy must be implemented, but they must act in a coordinated manner. According to them, the needs in the field of mental health should be considered a priority, all the more so due to the crisis situation, and systemic financing of mental health should be provided, and the field of mental health care for Health, to ensure the functioning of the Government Council for Mental Health in the optimal professional and decision-making composition.
NSi: Raising parental awareness is important
NSi highlights the work of the current government in this area: ""In 2018, the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program 2018-2028 or the Peace Program was adopted, and a proposal for an action plan for 2022 and 2023 is currently in the final stages. In 2021, the establishment of mental health centers for children and adolescents, which operate at the primary level of health care, has been accelerated to 16, and four are still in the process of being established. In this term of office, we have started to address this at an accelerated pace and provide funding for an additional 30 specializations of clinical psychologists. ""
However, they believe that prevention programs or psychosocial support programs, parenting programs and programs that deal with particularly vulnerable children and families are very important to strengthen their resilience: ""Programs must be available in schools, health care facilities and local communities Working with families is crucial, as almost half of the mental illnesses or disorders present in adulthood first appear before the age of fourteen. ""
In the field of modern technologies, it is important to raise awareness of parents: ""To be aware of their pitfalls and dangers, and work with children in schools in a way that on the one hand learn useful and safe uses of technology, and on the other teachers they are also aware of the dangers. ""
Let's connect Slovenia: Support in a familiar environment is crucial
Let's connect Slovenia emphasizes the construction of social inclusion systems at the local level, through which we would increase the sense of security and inclusion, they say: ""We believe that in prevention and prevention of consequences, support at home or in a familiar environment is crucial.""
""We also support the good practices of pilot projects of comprehensive mental care at home, which has been taking place in Primorska in recent years, as it shows excellent results,"" they state. ""Our goal in the next term is to establish a system that will transfer this comprehensive field approach to the whole of Slovenia. Namely, many mental distresses remain unanswered due to the distance of people from the centers and care.""
Modern technologies are a part of our lives, but they are becoming an increasingly important factor influencing the mental health of young people, he said: ""It is crucial that we deal with prevention, which means that spending time in connection with modern technology and the like. ""
SAB: Children would hand in their mobile devices before the start of the lesson and take it back after the end of the lesson
""In the SAB, we believe that there is an urgent need to strengthen mental health activities by promoting positive factors as a prevention against factors that negatively affect mental health. An individual's lifestyle has changed dramatically in recent years, becoming faster and more stressful. The amount of stress in the last two years has also been strongly influenced by the epidemic and its consequences - both in the health field and elsewhere - in the workplace, schools, ""the SAB estimates.
As one of the solutions to this problem, they see awareness of the importance of mental health in the workplace and schools - detabuzing the problem of mental health - as well as organizing free workshops (both prevention and treatment) and psychological counseling for individuals: "" patients have previously been in line for counseling. Mental health is inextricably linked to physical health and, consequently, to the well-being, functioning and productivity of the individual. ""
They also estimate that modern technology has strongly influenced the lives of adolescents and children, especially during the epidemic, when they were practically constantly in front of electronic devices: ""In the SAB, we believe and high schools could have a positive effect on their well-being. Children would hand in their mobile devices before school starts and take them back after school. ""
SD: Expanding the basket of compulsory health insurance rights
""While more than five million people have died in the world due to the covida-19 epidemic, every seventh person suffers from mental distress,"" the SD notes. Due to severe staff malnutrition and unacceptably long queues, many in the field of mental health are announcing the following measures in our country:
- Regulation of mental health legislation
""This includes the amendment of the Mental Health Act, which is deficient and outdated, as well as the drafting of two new laws: the Psychotherapy Act and the Psychological Activity Act. Legislation is a necessary basis for addressing accessibility, staff malnutrition and quality of care.""
- Make professional assistance accessible to all
""Establishment of additional mental health centers throughout Slovenia (for children and adolescents as well as for adults), which will be geographically evenly distributed according to the needs of the population.""
- Expanding the basket of compulsory health insurance rights
""In the field of mental health, we want to ensure more rights under health insurance by placing psychotherapy in the set of rights, which is crucial for the effective and long-term treatment of certain mental distresses and disorders.""
- Upgrading the personnel network
""Based on the in-depth analysis of population needs and the Action Plan 2022-2023 of the National Mental Health Program 2018-2028, quotas will be prepared to increase the number of specializations in psychiatry, child psychiatry and clinical psychology. In addition, we will strive to provide treatment, in particular in the field of mental health of the elderly, children and adolescents. ""
- Strengthening preventive and promotional activities
""Preventive measures can prevent the development or deepening of mental distress and disorders and thus raise the quality of life of people in the long run. Therefore, it is important that the field of mental health is included in education at all levels of the education system. in the field of raising mental health literacy and supporting activities aimed at reducing the stigma of mental health. ""
They promise that if they are among the parties that will make up the government, they and their coalition partners will address the preparation of a concrete plan immediately upon the new government and prepare the necessary legislation in the field of mental health in the first half. ""However, as resolving staff shortages is a long process, due to the long duration of specializations, we will announce at least 30 additional specializations in clinical psychology as a priority when the new government takes office.""
When it comes to the negative effects of technology on the mental health of young people, they suggest the following solutions:
- Implementation of parent education for the healthy use of digital screens of children and adolescents
- Educating children and young people about the healthy use of digital screens and strengthening the development of healthy habits (eg sleep hygiene, physical activity, socializing with friends without the use of digital screens)
- Promoting the healthy use of digital displays
- Strengthening sources of help for people facing problematic use of digital screens or even addiction

The SDS highlights the government's achievements in the field of mental health
The SDS also points out that in December 2017 the National Assembly adopted a Resolution on the National Mental Health Program 2018-2028, the basic goal of which is to transfer the focus of mental disorders from the secondary to the primary health level to the domestic environment: ""The first ten centers for mental health of children and adolescents, three centers for diagnostics and emergency treatment of children and adolescents have been established (at the Pediatric Clinic of the University Medical Center Ljubljana, the Department of Child Psychiatry at the University Medical Center Maribor and the University Psychiatric Clinic Ljubljana). The Government of Janez Janša provided funds for an additional ten beds for children and adolescents at the Center for Mental Health of the University Psychiatric Clinic in Ljubljana. € 1.5 million annually.These teams are zago for the Piran, Domžale, Maribor and Sevnica health centers. ""
However, as they point out, they are aware that the shortage of staff in this area is one of the major problems and challenges: "" Thus, this year the budget of the Republic of Slovenia provides funds for 10 specializations in clinical psychology, and in the next two years an additional 20. The Ministry of Health has also prepared an action plan for the national mental health program for the period 2021-2023. Awareness of the serious situation in the field of mental health signed a decision on the appointment of a working group on mental health on 1 April 2022. The group includes 23 experts (from doctors, the Ombudsman and the judiciary to NGOs). On 31 March 2022, the Government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted the Action Plan for 2022 and 2023 for the implementation of the Resolution on the National Mental Health Program 2018-2028. Special attention is paid to young people and includes goals for reducing suicide and alcohol-related mental disorders, tasks for strengthening knowledge and competencies in the field of mental health, for the implementation of social and family support programs and goals for activities and programs to establish support environment in educational, institutions, institutions and local communities.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/ukrajina/putin-ki-je-razocaral-berlusconija-naj-bi-novacil-odpuscene-vojake.html,"Putin, who disappointed Berlusconi, is said to have recruited dismissed soldiers","Clashes in eastern Ukraine are intensifying, with many trying to retreat safely along humanitarian corridors, whose security is being questioned every day. In cities where Russian forces have already withdrawn, new horrific details of what happened during the invasion are coming to light. Due to the events in Ukraine, Russian President Vladimir Putin has become the target of a once great friend, the Italian politician Silvio Berlusconi.","The conflict in Ukraine has shifted to the east of the country. Analysts believe that they are now also the best units of Ukraine in the east and that they are dug into ditch systems and other fortified positions.
So far, Ukrainian troops have strongly resisted Russia's advance, but Russia is also strengthening its forces under the new leadership. The Russian side said that the complete liberation of Donbass is now at the heart of the mission of its forces. With fewer forested areas here than in the north of the country, analysts say open areas could still favor Ukrainian defenders.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says Ukraine is ready for a difficult battle: ""It will be a difficult battle, we believe in this fight and our victory. We are ready to fight at the same time and look for diplomatic ways to end this war.""
Ukrainian negotiator Mikhail Podoljak said that Green and Russian President Vladimir Putin would not meet until Russia was defeated in the east.
In his last night's address, Zelensky said that Russia's aggression was never limited to Ukraine and that the whole of Europe was the target. The West has called for a full embargo on Russian energy and to provide Ukraine with additional weapons. He said Russia's use of force is a disaster that will inevitably affect everyone.
New horrific discoveries
The horrific consequences of the war continue to be seen in the Ukrainian cities from which Russian forces have withdrawn. In the city of Borodyanka near Kiev, the bodies of 10 civilians were pulled from the rubble, said the deputy head of the Ukrainian Emergency Service in the Kyiv region Bogdan Danilyuk.
As early as April 7, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Irina Venediktova said that 26 bodies had been found in the ruins of a city about 90 kilometers northwest of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, but the final number was much higher.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Borodyanka had suffered terrible losses during the invasion, and that the worst atrocities committed by Russian troops leaving the north of the country had not yet been discovered.
The British Ministry of Defense also wrote in a report on the situation in Ukraine that Russia's withdrawal from the north revealed mass graves and the use of civilians for human shields.
They also found evidence that Russia used improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to ""cause casualties, lower morale and restrict Ukraine's freedom of movement.""
The British Ministry also believes that Russia is trying to increase the number of soldiers with personnel discharged from military service after 2012 in response to the growing losses. Fighters from Transnistria in Moldova are also expected to be recruited. In the Luhansk region, according to the Ukrainian side, the forced mobilization of the population in the temporarily occupied territories is intensifying.
Moscow has not confirmed how many soldiers have been killed since the invasion began, but Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov admitted last week that Russia has suffered significant troop losses. Western leaders estimate that between 7,000 and 15,000 Russian soldiers have been killed.
However, the warring parties carried out a third prisoner exchange yesterday. The Russian side surrendered 26 Ukrainians, including 14 civilians. 14 Russian sailors have returned to Russia from the civilian ship Azov Concord, which has been detained in Mariupol since February 24.
Ukraine, meanwhile, also claims that Russian bombs destroyed the Dnieper airport.

""Overnight, high-precision missiles destroyed the base and headquarters of the Dnieper nationalist battalion in Zvonetskoye, which also recently received reinforcements from foreign mercenaries,"" the Russian Defense Ministry said.
The Russian army will be led in the war with Ukraine by a general ""with a dossier of brutality""
Russia has appointed a new Ukrainian military commander, a US official said, according to Sky News. 60-year-old General Alexander Dvornikov, one of Russia's most experienced military officers, is expected to lead the army in new attacks on Ukraine's incoming regions. As the Americans said, Dvornikov has already shown his brutality against civilians in Syria and other war zones.
White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, meanwhile, said ""the appointment of any general cannot erase the fact that Russia has already faced a strategic failure in Ukraine."" ""This general will be just another author of crimes and brutality against Ukrainian civilians,"" he added.
As he says, the US is determined to do everything in its power to support Ukrainians who are resisting Russian occupation.
Returning diplomacy
The EU, meanwhile, has reopened its embassy in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, which it has temporarily relocated to Poland following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell announced this during his visit to Ukraine on Friday. Matti Maasikas, head of the EU delegation to Ukraine, published a photo of the EU flag indicating the return of the diplomatic mission.

In a conversation with Zelenski, Scholz condemned war crimes
In a telephone conversation with the Ukrainian president, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz condemned the ""horrific war crimes of the Russian army"". He assured Ukrainians of solidarity and full support from Germany, said German government spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann. The German government and its international partners will do everything possible to ensure that crimes are investigated and the perpetrators identified so that they can be held accountable before national and international courts, she added.
Zelensky, however, wrote online that he also spoke with Scholz about ""anti-Russian sanctions and Ukraine's defense and financial support."" As he stated, he called on the Chancellor to support the investigation of war crimes committed by Russian forces in his country.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer visited Kiev on Saturday. At the same time, Zelensky reiterated his demand to stop the import of Russian oil, which would cause Russia to lose billions in revenues from military interventions.
According to Russian media reports, Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to meet with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko at the Vostochny cosmodrome in Russia's Far East in the coming days. It is unclear at this time whether the meeting will be on Monday or Tuesday.
While Pope Francis called for a ceasefire in Ukraine during the Easter holidays, Russian Orthodox Church leader Kirill, considered a close ally of Putin, called on believers to unite against Moscow's ""external and internal enemies."" ""In this difficult time for our homeland, may the Lord help us to unite, including around the authorities,"" the French news agency AFP quoted the Russian news agency TASS as saying.
The patriarch, whose church unites about 150 million believers, has repeatedly supported the Russian military operation in Ukraine in sermons. Orthodox Easter will be on April 24, one week after Catholic Easter.
Downing Street confirmed in the afternoon that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had already returned to the United Kingdom after an unannounced visit to Kiev.
Berlusconi disappointed with Putin
However, former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi spoke about the war in Ukraine, saying he was deeply disappointed and saddened by the Russian president's behavior.
When he was in power, Berlusconi became close friends with Putin and also invited him on holiday to his villa in Sardinia. “I have known him for about 20 years and he has always seemed to me a democrat and a man of peace,” the 85-year-old billionaire said when addressing a convention of his conservative party Forza Italia in Rome.
Berlusconi, who served three times as head of the Italian government between 1994 and 2011, had previously refrained from publicly criticizing Putin. ""Faced with the horror of massacres of civilians in Bucha and other places, real war crimes, Russia cannot deny its responsibility,"" he added on Saturday."

That's bad","Human rights, zeh, refugee rights, zeh, zeh, environment, global warming, media freedom, zeh, zeh, zeh ... Most of the key, extremely important things for the average voter are, let's face it, boring. if at all possible, overhear.","Otherwise not too good a movie, don't look up, it shows nicely. A young astronomer discovers that a comet is approaching Earth and that the world will be irrevocably over in about half a year. When she tries to convince those responsible, including the President of the United States, she encounters only patronizing rejection, the media soon starts attacking her in all possible ways, and her ex-boyfriend serves with a hastily written book in which he claims she has always been neurotic and unbalanced. . The world is really over then. There is no more Bruce Willis to save at the last minute.
But not only that, some astute commentators also note that voters don’t really like politicians, nor do they like democracy.
Elections have taken place or will take place in these days and weeks in three countries that are relatively close to us.
Serbia, where Vučić himself made fun of his position as an omnipotent candidate in the election campaign when a married couple surprises by jumping out of the fridge. There are practically no independent media in Serbia, they are all full of praise, it seems that he is the eternal president. In Hungary, a very similar situation, Orban wins, although the opposition has gone so far as to unite from the far right to the left, and Orban has won even more votes. There is a cult of tradition, anti-modernism and irrationality at work, as Umberto Eco would say.
It is interesting what is happening in France, the first round of elections is this weekend.
Voter support has fluctuated widely, with some indications for a while that one of the candidates for the second round will be Eric Zenmour, a man who said, among other things, that women are the goal and prey of a superior man who wants to climb the social ladder. Emigrants were also targeted, social benefits for the poor, and the percentages of affection only went up for a while. But because he bet too much on identity issues, he started to lose, and Marine Le Pen climbed, once the fear and trembling of not only the left pole but all decent people in France, but now she has sharpened her views a bit, started talking about it will increase people’s purchasing power, lower fuel and food prices, and the numbers have only gone up then, if it makes it to the second round, it could even beat Macron.
So where are we going?
Constant repetition of mantras such as 'lower taxes will save us', 'lean state', 'justice, media and minorities need to be deprived of power', 'public health, education, housing for all, higher taxes on capital, humane immigration legislation' , Are the extremes that any middle-class voter can tremble at. All this leaves traces, a society is being built that is losing some fundamental dignity without glorifying past times as if they were idyllic in that sense. However, there is more that is acceptable, permissible and even rewarding, whether it is the most backward attitudes and gross insults based on gender, sexual orientation and nationality, or proven acts of corruption. Getting rich at any cost, the prevailing mentality is greed, Slovenian hygge is not a candle on the window, firewood in the fireplace and a warm blanket, Slovenian hygge is Porsche, and holidays in Aruba with this or that influencer.
Maybe this is the right time to shake off the Eurocentric focus, look at parts of the world where we go on an exotic holiday at best, or import some shamans who then reveal deeper secrets to us.
Gabriel Boric, 36 years old, his paternal ancestors are from the Croatian island of Ugljan. He is the new, recently elected President of Chile. His government has 24 departments, comprising 14 women, independent experts, representatives of the regions and student leaders. Boric was also once a student activist. Being prime minister now is an incredible advance for a country that, like some other South Americans, Argentina, for example, not so long ago preferred to torture student activists and then throw them from helicopters into the sea. The government also includes, for the first time in Chile's history, a minister and minister who have publicly declared themselves to be same-sex. And in the government is also the great-granddaughter of the assassinated socialist president of Chile, Salvador Allende, in a military coup. Boric's government program briefly includes the welfare state, a smaller gap between private and public health care, more money for education, raising taxes for the rich and mining companies.
At the same time, he talks about fiscal sustainability - obviously a smart guy - and the markets are still satisfied.
It is not just Chile that is following this path to the far end of the world. A good example is Uruguay, where the welfare state, the general welfare and a thriving economy without the dominance of drug cartels and corruption with a good education and social protection system are extremely active. And yes, with quite high taxes. And with the right to abortion, marriage and adoption of children for all couples.
A similar thing is happening in Bolivia and in some other countries of this region.
What about the United States? A bastion of neoliberal mantras, the exclusive functioning of the market, leaving people to find themselves, which is considered a special value. But even there, things are changing.
A few days ago, the first union in Amazon was historic. The peak of union activity in the United States, between 1940 and 1978, when a third of the workers were members, was considered the time of the greatest equality of wealth and income. Today, managers get up to 320 times more than employees, in 1965, for example, only 20 times more.
No one working 40 hours a week should live in poverty. So says Bernie Sanders, among other things, perhaps after British Prime Minister Clement Atlee was the politician who did the most for the benefit of very many people. He is now struggling, among other things, to adopt a minimum hourly rate everywhere so that full-time employees are not dependent on food stamps.
660 American billionaires earned 1,300 billion during the pandemic. However, according to research, this inequality worries only one percent of Americans. They simply do not know how to relate it to their situation.
The whole world has been watching and condemning the war and crimes in Ukraine in recent weeks. Europe accepts refugees, and rightly so. It is symptomatic and painful, however, that some other crimes, some other refugees, have been completely overlooked. A few days ago, the World Food Program announced that it would have to cut the already meager food ration by half for Yemeni refugees, millions of whom already have. They are running out of money, they would need about a billion and a half more. Something the world's billionaires have in their pocket as a reserve.
Everyone can imagine what it is like to die if you are blown up by a bomb or hit by a bullet. If you could only imagine what it's like when you die slowly from hunger, you watch children who are fewer and fewer every day ...
If we go back to Europe and add a few things that happened in parallel with the victories of Vucic and Orban: despite terrible propaganda, the opposition in Serbia still won some seats in parliament, Vucic himself will not be able to form a government.
In Hungary, a referendum was held at the same time as the elections, which would severely restrict same-sex rights. It failed because activists urged people to cast invalid ballots. And they are.
Speaking of the elections in France, we will see how it goes for Jean-Luc Melenchon, a representative of the left wing and an advocate of the welfare state, who also suddenly began to gain the support of voters.
And with us? One of the important features of the pre-election period is the high level of engagement, namely civil society, trade unions, non-governmental organizations and associations ask parties and candidates demanding substantive questions. They want to know who they will give their vote to.
Of course, many people will vote because one candidate is more sympathetic to them, because the mayor of this and that party has arranged a local road, because the pastor will hint at that, or because he promises some small benefit. After all, whole systems were falling apart because people wanted to wear real Levis instead of Elkroj jeans.
This is all understandable, but it may be too little. Because these important issues that people are not too interested in will shape our lives at all levels in the future.
In the movie Dont Look Up, at the end, when the comet is near, a group of chosen people fly to safety on a distant planet, where they are taken by an eccentric billionaire.
The question we need to ask ourselves is, where are we all going to go?"
https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/zelimo-se-pogovarjati-z-vsemi-strankami-ki-bodo-v-parlamentu-niso-pa-v-danasnji-vladi.html,'We want to talk to all the parties that will be in parliament but not in today's government',"The president of the Svoboda Movement, Robert Golob, is convinced that his party will win the elections and nominate a candidate for the government, which he says will most likely be his own. He completely rejects the legacy of the current government. So how does he explain that he took two deputies into his ranks to help appoint her? What will be his ethical standards in politics, how would he navigate with coalition partners and how will he address challenges such as healthcare, the public sector wage system and the creation of higher value-added jobs?","You are not a complete newcomer to the Slovenian political scene, but you are still perceived as a new face who appeared during this election. The last few elections have taken place in our country with the appearance of a new face. What will be different this time?
I think that the appearance of new faces can also be a reaction of people to the fact that they are not satisfied with the existing party offer. But why do I believe that we can offer freshness that will not be short-lived, but will lead to radical and structural changes in this country? Because we are trying to capture a sufficiently wide range of different people who actually have experience from different social subsystems. I myself have experience not only from the economy, but also from knowledge of state and local politics. At the same time, we are not contaminated, marked by past decisions of state policy. That is to say, we are coming people who know how politics works, but we have not yet tested ourselves in it and we are not prisoners of past mistakes. And it seems to me that being able to come with an unburdened view is the best guarantee that we will actually try to introduce new things. We will not, as you say, be a new face, above all we will be a new politician.
But your client was formed in express time. Is it possible to get to know your candidates so well in such a short time that you can vouch for them?
We humans change our whole lives. Even some you know surprise you after ten years. We tried to get to know the candidates as well as possible, we introduced a system where we had three candidates for each candidate position. We weren’t looking for one, but we had three, which we decided on not only based on which one made the best impression and which one wasn’t unmarked in the past, but also based on how they can work together. So we were looking for a wide enough set, diverse people who form a functioning whole. Of course. If we had another month, two or three, we could get even better results, but on the other hand, it is necessary to draw the line once and make a decision. So I'm satisfied.
But I am even more pleased with what you will see after the election, that is, with the executive team. For in this process, we have not only dealt with the selection of candidates for parliament. In fact, we once again have so many people willing to take on the executive function.
Miro Cerar spoke similarly in 2014, but then we saw what was happening to his client, what followed the violent rise. He stepped down two years ago, saying it was no longer his client. Do you have such fears?
I come from the economy. And when I involuntarily left the economy after fifteen years, I said it was still my business. Gen-I is still my business after fifteen years - I feel like it’s mine at heart - I’m not its owner and never will be. And that may be the difference. Gen-I grew from four employees in 2002 to 600 employees. When you know how to build a team and identify with it, something like this cannot happen to you.
However, you accepted, for example, Janja Sluga and Jurij Lep, who helped to form the current government. Why did you decide to do this, what is the message of this?
They were not the only ones to set up this government, but they were the first to say no to this government. And that was the key criterion. I understand that a person also makes a mistake in life. He who knows how to admit a mistake as soon as possible, accept responsibility for it and then take the other side and start correcting it, has great value in my eyes as a human being. Namely, many people prefer not to admit a mistake, just so that it doesn't turn out, than if they made it. And these are, in fact, the people who keep this government alive today. Not those who admitted the mistake, but those who still persist in it. They are even trying to get into politics again, under new names and disguises.
But because of that, Ivan Gale supposedly gave up on you. Are you sorry about that?
That ""supposedly"" is just in place. Mr. Gale had an open door to our party, he could choose anything and make any request. He made no demands, but decided as he did, without explaining why. Explaining that it was the fault of MP Janja Sluga, he started giving later when you started asking him why he did not join us. When I asked him this myself, I didn’t get an answer.
Where did Igor Zorčič get lost in this story?
See the STA example. There is an important distinction as to who fought against the government of Janez Janša and then resigned. And here is the distinction between the two. I wouldn't go deeper, but you always have to draw a line somewhere and we drew it between Janja Sluga and Igor Zorčič.
In the case of STA?
For example.
Was it part of the calculation that you came to confrontations with two deputies on RTV?
Ofcourse not. It just so happened now. By the way, other Members also offered themselves to us. We could have five or more Members today. However, we did not want to break up any of the KUL parties and we did not want to receive the deputies who ended up today in the party you have already mentioned, in the company of Ivan Galet. I want to say that we were selective. We rejected those that we judged did not fit our team the best. That doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with them, but we’ve put together a team that we count on to be cohesive and not each of them individually pulling to their side.
So who exactly did you reject?
I hinted, but not about names. When politics becomes nominal, and this is unfortunately too common in Slovenia, then it is no longer politics, but interpersonal relations, reckonings and resentments. I think politics is more than that we all have to go through these personal stories and deal with what is good for the country and the people, not with individuals by name and surname.
Recent polls suggest that the LMŠ and SAB parties will fight to enter parliament. Are you worried about that? If one of the KUL parties drops out of parliament, will coalition negotiations probably be more difficult?
We are all fighting to enter parliament, not just them. But I certainly very much want to be able to form a stable and strong government after the elections. It is in our interest that as many KUL parties as possible, ie from the center-left, come to parliament. This is our common interest. Voters, however, decide as they choose, we can’t influence that much. Some who may vote for us may have voted for one of the KUL parties in the past. Many will decide on the last day. I do know, however, that most of our voters are those who may have been undecided in the past, or were voters of parties that are no longer really on the scene today. Therefore, I am convinced that it is the Freedom Movement that will enable the center-left government to be stable and strong. For if Freedom had not emerged, these voices would probably have remained at home or scattered across the spectrum, and we would again have a relationship similar to the one we have in Parliament today. Somehow half-and-half between the ruling party and the opposition.
I reckon that by attracting the undecided, who have been saturated with the policies of both, we will be able to form a stable government. I really believe in that.
So 60 seats or more?
Of course, if we look at the polls, it shows that the government itself would have a comfortable majority, somewhere between 53 and 56 MPs. Why am I talking about 60 myself? Because I want us to be able to at least programmatically form coalitions, perhaps project coalitions for individual cases, which will have a larger majority than the government itself. But who says it just has to be a relationship, whether you’re in or not? Let us remember the 1990s and the governments of Janez Drnovšek, who had very different statuses - project cooperation, program cooperation, associate members of the coalition. We have already seen all this in Slovenia and with respectful dialogue this is possible. But when we put ours-yours, which is the situation today, then it is only whether you are in government or not, but to govern in different ways and the interest of the people is that when we seek a broader consensus for a project, such as election system that we will then seek some broader support. Not just because we have to, but because it’s right.
So the KUL coalition is not the only one that is interesting to you. How interesting is it to you at all? You recently said that you will also be talking to clients specifically. Which one is closest to you and how far will you reach the right political pole in these conversations?
We have no agreement with KUL. We have refused to enter KUL and we are not talking about it. We see them as those who are closest to us in terms of values ​​and program orientations. We will certainly diverge somewhere else, but there are also differences between them. However, we want to talk to all the parties that will be in parliament but not in today's government. But who says that no new party will break through? People will decide who will be in parliament.
We may one day find some program or project collaboration with those in government, but time will tell.
I think it is crucial that the government draws a clear line and says - we have nothing to do with the legacy of the current government, no continuity and we will break it. Therefore, no one in today’s government can be in ours. What will he do? He will try to retain the privileges he has created for himself. It doesn't matter what it's called. Whether NSi, which does not staff, their staff is everywhere, or Specifically, which is honest, I do not know how many investigations… In short, it does not matter which of them promises to come to the next government and offer for it. They will not be in the next government, as this would allow our government to accept the legacy of this government, which we reject in its entirety.
So you do not exclude project cooperation with the parties of the current government?
Let’s say we have a project of an electoral system. Isn't it logical that the government will offer cooperation to parties that will not be in the government? We know in advance who will reject this. Nothing wrong, we won't miss them. But we know who is the one who is being offered today as a connecting link on projects.
So New Slovenia?
The one who will decide that way. Maybe the Slovenian National Party.
If we go back to KUL… There are speculations about the mandate. How do you see this embarrassment?
I don't see any embarrassment. Of course, the Freedom Movement will get the most votes, and of course the Freedom Movement will give a mandate, and I will most likely do it myself.
According to opinion polls, people today are very clearly determined. If there will be such relationships, then there will be no embarrassment for anyone.
What about post-election cooperation with some parties, such as the Left. You have the modernization of the Slovenian Army in your program, the Left predicts that this is the topic that will be the hardest nut to crack in any coalition negotiations. Are you ready for that and how much does Levica have to worry about being dropped from the talks because of her views?
I do not believe that the coalition would fall apart because of such things. After this experience we have in the last two years, when we are about to slip from autocracy to dictatorship, I think we have all learned, especially the current opposition, that some things need to be looked at more broadly, including choosing a lesser evil. . In this particular case, however, I do not see a point where the coalition would fall apart. Because I myself do not believe that increasing the cost of buying armored vehicles or aircraft is the right thing to do. The point is not in military spending, but in security spending. The army is not meant for itself. In some part, missions abroad, and primarily the security of our country. At this time, however, you are no longer building security through armored vehicles, which also do not benefit the Russians in Ukraine much. What is important for security are completely different systems. We have civil protection and rescue as an important part and cyber security as an even more important part. Then we have specialized weapons, such as drones. We have the best light aircraft manufacturer in the world, but we do not know how to connect this knowledge with the military industry. I want to say that Slovenia can offer a lot in the field of security, if we take the security issue as an investment in starting a specialized economy, which will also have its market niche within NATO, which is even desirable today, then we will kill three flies at once. the Left will also agree, because we will not endanger people with these weapons, on the contrary, we will increase security and create value for the country, and consequently we will have more money for social services.
Why did you decide to run in the same constituency as Luka Mesec?
Because according to our analyzes, there are three districts in Ljubljana where we can get the most votes, and we stuck to that. We had a choice of center and Šiška. In the end, I opted for two counties. Not to maximize my personal percentage, but the number of votes that the Freedom Movement will receive. Otherwise, there would be someone in every county.
There are only four presidents of KUL…
I told you we don't have an agreement with KUL. We didn’t put much effort into avoiding each other.
What about Zoran Janković? He came to support you at the convention, then we heard that you have nothing to do with Positive Slovenia. Can we understand this as if you understood that his support could harm you, especially outside Ljubljana?
Mayor Janković has done a lot for Ljubljana, no one can take that away from him. It is true, however, that when I appeared on the scene in November, he offered to take over Positive Slovenia. I didn’t want that and I don’t regret it because we wanted to put things anew. We didn’t want to be a part of the past, we wanted a new story with new perspectives. This is the political part.
Even later, when he himself asked if he could express his support for us, I said that as an individual and a mayor, he could always express his support. When we had the convention, we, as the mayor of the city where we had the convention, invited him in line with political etiquette and gave him the opportunity to publicly explain his support. We give the same opportunity to anyone who is willing to publicly support us. Anyone who will publicly support us without having a desire to return the favor in the background is welcome. However, we reject silent support from the background, which is always associated with counter-services. That he supported us in public seems to me to be the only real way we will not dream of uncles from the background. We want to have those who support us publicly known.
Let us remember the Congress of Positive Slovenia about a decade ago, when you said because of the events with the CCP that the Queen, Janković, must also be sacrificed. After that, the pharmacist affair happened. How did you meet again?
We didn't. That is exactly what I am talking about. I believe that Mayor Janković has recognized in our party an element that can have a positive impact on the political landscape in Slovenia. That's how I perceive it. It is true, however, that our history has had its ups and downs. But we always had an honest relationship and when I disagreed, I said it, even in public. There were two congresses and I shared my views on both. At the first congress, I suggested that, given that he and Janša were suspected of corruption risks, if we wanted to get rid of Janša's government, which was short-lived at the time, we had to decide whether we were willing to sacrifice our king, not the queen. When we decided at the next congress whether we would support the government of Alenka Bratušek, I supported the government.
We also once heard that you are a jumper on the chessboard because you like to jump uncontrollably left and right. Is this still the case? How should voters understand this?
That was ten years ago, when I wanted to say very clearly that I was independent within Positive Slovenia and that I was able to use moves that are in fact the least conventional. The straight jumper moves the least straight and the least conventional. This part of not thinking linearly still applies to me. And that’s exactly why I believe we can start solving most problems in a different way.
Today we are prisoners of history for the last 15, 20 years, when most governments take a very straightforward approach to all problems - from health, pensions, youth… We want to change this view, say, so it has been so far, but now we will start looking for new ways they will be innovative.
As one of the fundamental values, you emphasize respect, and you have written that you will establish cultural dialogue and normal, respectful and inclusive communication at all levels of society. How will you achieve this in a politically heated scene? The rift between right and left is extremely deep.
It needs to start elsewhere. I believe that the political scene is divided today. At the same time, however, I see that a respectful dialogue between parties that do not participate in government - and even with some of them is possible - is quite normal.
We talk respectfully with KUL, as well as with civil society. And if we are able to talk respectfully with ordinary people, this is the right foundation.
Before the elections, it is fashionable to emphasize how to connect with everyone. This is pure bluff. This is not respect, but lying. He who explains to you today that he would connect with everyone, of course on his own terms, is lying. We have clearly set the line for who we believe will stick to when they say something and will seek solutions in a respectful dialogue.
It is crucial, however, that we establish a respectful dialogue between people, because this division is spreading among people, and that is what is harmful. Not between clients, the problem is the division between people, between neighbors, co-workers and we really want to slowly, but above all with results and hard work, fix it.
Marjan Šarec met with Janez Janša four years before the elections. Are you? Would you?
It never crossed my mind!
When was the last time you talked?
I have seen Janez Janša once in the last ten years, last autumn at an event on the energy future. There were 40 of us and I imagined what Gen-I could contribute to Slovenia's energy future.
What about after the election? Will you talk?
I hope that we will meet in confrontations before the elections. And that's that.
The outgoing government has faced a number of scandals, but the ministers who were at the center of these developments have remained. But what would be your tolerance for mistakes, slips and irregularities? What does ethics in politics mean to you?
I will return to what we have already talked about. That everyone has the right that when he recognizes a mistake and sincerely apologizes, he gets another chance. But it depends on the mistake. Not all mistakes are the same. There is a line for mistakes as well. You can call it ethics or the rule of law. So there are mistakes that can be corrected, I believe that you do not progress without mistakes. But there are mistakes that are so big and important that it is necessary to say goodbye.
I have been dealing with all this for the last 15 years in the economy. I learned from my colleagues from my mistakes, and I said goodbye to some of them. I have no problem with that. A quick farewell when someone doesn’t belong on the team by values ​​is most effective. I can’t work with people with whom we fundamentally disagree that what we do is fair and right. I believe you will tell me that this is naive in politics. Okay, but we'll be a little naive at first. But it is through this that we will be able to introduce new standards. We will start with a culture of dialogue and I believe that through this we will be able to establish an ethic of action.
One more thing, I have never received a euro bribe in my life, I have zero tolerance for that.
But how much money will you spend on the election campaign, which is an expensive project. Who finances it?
Different. The funds we have in our account were selected exclusively through donations from individuals with first and last names. I myself was among the donors.
How much of that money will it be?
I didn’t look at the bill, but if I knew it was going to be a question, I would tell the exact figure. However, we estimate that the campaign will cost around 400,000 euros. The good news, not just for us, is that most bills always fall due after elections. And given that the polls show us very well, we can also time the use of funds according to the expected result. I have no worries from that point of view.
Aleš Hojs has revealed that they are expecting your income tax return on RTV. You will send it, why not? Did you have any income other than Gen-I?
No, I had no income. However, I was surprised when the Minister of the Interior first pointed out that he was looking forward to my income tax returns. At first I thought they were looking forward to it at the Police, where I would probably really send her again. However, when I found out that the RTV editorial board started requesting this information on the basis of his intervention, and then Minister Hojs said again that 'they' - in the first person plural - were expecting it, I thought it was horrible. How can the Minister of Police, together with the RTV editorial board, expect the personal data of a political competitor? And he talks about it in public. It is a police state. And therefore: for the sake of democracy and the rule of law, it does not occur to me to send my personal data to these police collaborators on RTV or the Minister of Police. However, I have nothing to hide and when the time comes, if necessary, I will publish it. However, I don't think it will be necessary, there is nothing that we haven't already published in several places, including your portal. But I don’t mean to play by their notes.
Gen-I will, as circulated in some media, respond to hints about paying journalists in recent years. How will he respond?
In fact, this is another story when, on the one hand, we are dealing with several televisions that receive money for their work from an unknown source from abroad, and they think that is fine. Television has leased ads on behalf of our client on Google. New 24TV. Then one of their satellites, whom I will not name for not advertising it, spins an alleged story about the financing of one of the independent portals, which is a big thorn in the side of the government and its president. I believe that Gen-I will respond in accordance with the legal deadline and legal obligations. What I know and can tell you on this topic is that neither the Freedom Movement nor Gen-I had anything to do with the mentioned portal this year. No contract or deal, no money spilled.
But what will be your contribution to media independence if you come to power? Will you be able to resist the temptation of the authorities to subjugate them?
Absolutely. Here our contribution will be greatest. I believe that the collective is as strong and as good as it accepts responsibilities and is empowered. Empowering the collective is the best way for the collective to fulfill its mission. There is no other way. In public television, this means empowering their collective. The program scheme, the program council - this must come from within, not from outside, and in the Freedom Movement we will not only support this, but we will insist that other coalition parties accept it as well. That they will be able to resist temptation.
You have announced that you will be giving away the Gen-I award for last year to some NGOs…
I've already done that.
But who are the recipients?
No one has received it yet, because the award is formally decided by the assembly by approving the annual report. It’s always the end of June and that’s when it will be officially known if the prize will be and how high it will be. And because I do not want anyone to speculate or influence this, I gave up this award in advance, in January, at the notary, whatever it may be. The amount will be transferred to humanitarian organizations.
Which one?
Nine. However, I will not talk about them until it is known what the amount is. I’d rather surprise them when they get it than embarrass them now unnecessarily. But you don’t have to speculate in political waters. Time will tell. None of them, however, know he is on the list.
You wrote two program documents, one election and one long-term. Some other parties already had an election program when your party was just starting its political path. Are these two documents something you are proud of? What is it in them that will bring Slovenia to a new level?
No country document is going anywhere. The document is just a guide. If I am proud of anything, I am proud of the people, including the people who prepared these two documents. Why two? The first is long-term, it talks about the vision of 2030 and what kind of society we want to become. In this document, we talk about being an open society, a free society and a socially just society that will be in solidarity with each other. But the election document is alive. External circumstances in the world are changing rapidly and to stand in time and say, this is my program that I will stick to for five years as I learned in business, it does not exist. You need to have a living document that brings you closer to the ideals you set for the next 10 years. The ideals are known, we are proud of them. However, we have a living document with which the team will manage the next steps on how we will achieve these goals.
There are three urgent points in the election document. The first is healthcare. We are not running away from this. This is not the point of one minister, but of a large team to be presented before the election, and also of the Prime Minister. The second point is climate action, which is also not a matter for one ministry, this point is also crucial if we want a community that will not destroy the planet, but will preserve it for its children. The third is solidarity between the generations. We're getting older. There will be more and more of us in retirement, there will be less and less natural increase of those who will meet our pension requirements according to the flow system. Therefore, it is first necessary to take care of young people so that they will feel respected and will be able to create a home in Slovenia. So that they will not flee abroad, but vice versa, that they will come to us from abroad. Then we will know that we will be able to take care of a safe and dignified old age. If we don’t take care of the young first, there will be nothing.
Unfortunately, the fact that we have full employment today, but we have not raised productivity and added value, will not help fill this gap. Low value-added jobs do not fill the gap, at most they increase it. The only way out of the vicious spiral is to raise added value. Those of us who come from the economy know this. Gen-I has 250,000 euros of added value per employee, while in Slovenia we have 40,000. Most jobs are between 20,000 and 30,000. With those jobs, we will never move into a 2030 vision that is globally competitive and socially just because we will not generate enough money.
Danijel Bešič Loredan is supposed to be the candidate for your Minister of Health, but who else will be in your medical team?
You have a confrontation on healthcare on your television on Monday, and I will say even more then, and the team will be presented at a roundtable on healthcare on 19 April.
How do you assess the work of the current Minister Janez Poklukar? Maybe you talked to him about collaborating?
No. We have not talked to anyone from this government about cooperation, we do not have that intention. I will not go into the assessment of him personally, but I will say something else. We were justifiably proud of our health. When you go abroad, to the US, you see how good healthcare we once had. However, over time, with covid, this has accelerated further, losing its reputation, power and accessibility. If we do not make radical changes and reverse the trend, we will be left without public health. Maybe it's someone's interest, mine certainly isn't. It’s mine to have strong public health, not to walk more every year.
Minister Poklukar announced that he would leave the proposal of the vaccination program for 2022 to his successor. Slovenia remained below 60 percent in vaccination. You say you are not in favor of compulsory vaccination. But would you support compulsory vaccination in individual groups? And how would you prepare for a possible new wave of new coronavirus?
Ever since the war in Ukraine started and the Prime Minister has been wandering around the eastern parts, covid-19 has miraculously disappeared from Slovenia. This is in its own right, as the situation in society has relaxed considerably. For if there was one reason we did not have high vaccinations, it is precisely this psychosis in the society that this government has established. There are analyzes that clearly show that anywhere in the world, the percentage of vaccinations is influenced by trust in government. If we have low vaccination coverage, it means complete distrust of government. What did the government do first when covid-19 was launched - in addition to masks and lost trucks? They beheaded the NIJZ. On the one hand, we have the incompetence of the government, and they have beheaded the supreme professional institution in this field, and they have given Jelko Kacin an explanation and confidence-building. The result is here. No opposition can do as much harm among the people as an incompetent government can.
However, it seems to me that we are all very lucky that the omicron strain has emerged. I hope the virus stays less deadly for the host. However, it is transmitted very quickly and none of the existing measures protect against infection. Not vaccinating with existing vaccines, nor wearing masks, at least not in the way ordinary people wear them. Therefore, to say that mandatory vaccination in the omicron strain would be useful, according to the assurances of the profession, premature, unprofessional… I do not believe in that either. If we compare ultra-vaccinated Israel and Denmark and low-vaccinated Slovenia, we see that data on infection first jumped in these two countries. Vaccination in Denmark did not prevent infections. I was vaccinated myself. However, I know of cases of people who have been vaccinated three times and have been infected with omicron twice already. Mandatory vaccination, therefore, as long as we are dealing with these strains, certainly not. If a new strain, a new disease, emerges, the profession will decide then.
The right hand of the Prime Minister is the Minister of Finance. Who would be yours?
We will reveal this after the election. We agreed not to talk about it.
So you already have it?
Yes.
In the public sector, expectations of the new government are very high. Also in financial terms. How will you navigate the relationship with them? What is your attitude towards the single pay system. And on the other hand - how to ensure higher wages and better conditions in the economy?
Why would a higher salary be something that comes naturally? I believe we all deserve higher wages. But we need to create higher value, government action must be primarily focused on creating higher value. Then it will be enough for everyone. Today, however, it is impossible to talk about the goal of higher wages in the public sector. However, a huge amount of injustice can be observed in the public sector within the existing system. And because of these injustices, we will soon establish what this government is not: social dialogue. We will respectfully meet with all the unions and discuss whether they want a single public pay system to remain. They must first decide on this. Then we will most likely get to the point where we find that the foundation can be common, and then things will have to be tackled separately by areas because the areas are so diverse. Today, by not distinguishing between areas, we are creating injustices. The most beautiful example is within healthcare, where we have total injustices between medical staff and doctors - and even among doctors by age. And if we don’t address them, we will never come up with a pay system that is fair. The current one is unfair to those who have the least. We will first eliminate injustices, create value in the meantime, and then we will be able to share the newly created value on a new basis. Only this path is right. It is immoral for me to want someone who is already privileged today, because he is well connected to the current government, to earn a little more for himself before the elections.
You are announcing a universal child allowance. What would be the amount of such an allowance and what financial effects on public finances are we talking about?
We must first ask ourselves what the purpose of this is. The intention is that no child should be hungry. And at the point where our kids are hungry at school, we’re not wondering about public finances. We need to make sure that this money is spent on purpose. Unfortunately, we have cases where child allowances today are not spent for the benefit of the child, but for other purposes. That needs to be fixed. Unfortunately, we still have cases where single mothers, the socially disadvantaged and even those who work, perhaps just above the ""minimum"", run out of time so that their children would not be hungry so that they would not catch a cold. This will be a child allowance. We need to take care of the children so that they have a safe and well-off youth, that is the duty of our society.
What about foreign policy? Where would you position yourself? What kind of relations would you build with Hungary, Russia and the current superpowers?
A distinction needs to be made between countries, nations, governments and the policies pursued by these governments. We also have a government in Slovenia that many people are not most proud of. So it is no wonder that we also agree a little less with any other government. I believe that it is necessary to have good relations with everyone, but I also believe that Slovenia is part of the European Union and that our commitment is primary. I am thinking, however, that we are part of a community, not a solo actor, not one that creates problems and provokes all the time, but one that cooperates creatively, respectfully and co-creates the EU.
However, foreign policy should be profiled in two other areas. The first is economic. Having economic attachés in countries where the economy is strong would be a necessity. On the other hand, we need to be actively involved in territorial cooperation. We used to have Alpe-Adria. In this area, too, we need to step up cooperation with our closest neighbors to make it easier to find some solutions within the geographical area - for example, how to achieve self-sufficiency at the nutritional level and how to achieve self-sufficiency at the energy level. Macro-regions are areas within which self-sufficiency can be achieved in areas where we cannot achieve it on our own.
For the end. How do you respond to the accusation that you went into politics when you lost your chair?
I will give you two answers. The first is material. The accusations at first were that I was left without a salary. I still have a salary that is not much lower than the one I had before. Even the prize is still allowed.
More important, however, is the following. Every man finds himself at a crossroads, he has certain anchors. My anchor was that I was responsible for the company I created and ran. It would be irresponsible on the part of any director to engage in running or campaigning for politics instead of running a business. And as long as I was in charge of the company, I avoided public appearances and engagements in politics. Which isn’t to say that I may not have been very well informed and connected in the background. That’s why the decision was so much easier.
But I figured there would be more of us. When I was a director, I was approached by different people, quite a few of them, and they all said, we will do something together. Then came November 15th and I figured I wouldn’t that they couldn’t ... In short, it was hard for everyone to expose themselves to what we see now, but not to me. Because I believe that there is only one thing that has always made us stand up in history: that is, when they try to take away your dignity. This is not revenge. Freedom of society and the dignity of the individual are the goals that my ancestors fought for, I am proud of them, and so am I.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/volitve/kako-bi-stranke-gospodarile-z-gozdovi-denar-od-lesa-za-pokojnine-posegi-v-sidg-blagovna-znamka.html,"How clients would manage forests: Money from wood for pensions, interventions in SiDG ...","Politics has agreed for some time that the forest is our great wealth, but practice says that our wealth is always a temptation. According to personnel changes, the battle for the state forest worth two billion euros is at the forefront of every government. But the quality of management could be discussed, the places of wood, which are measured in dozens of trucks, can be seen, but no one seems to notice them. What kind of forest management do the parties predict before the elections?","Before the elections, there are, of course, no promises of policy on prudent forest management and efficient use of funds from this title - the policy promises can be found below.
But before that, it is worth emphasizing how severe our problems are in this area, which we have already noted in a series of articles for the Facts section. For example, more than a thousand cubic meters of wood disappear from state forests every year. Most stolen wood from state-owned forests, which cover 12 percent of Slovenia's surface, was recorded in 2020, when as many as 100 full timber trucks were removed. For the most part, the perpetrators have to cut down the trees first and pull them out of the woods by truck. Therefore, the question is how such actions can go unnoticed. There are almost no judicial epilogues. Stolen wood from Slovenian forests also ends up in Austria and Italy.
At the same time, it is certainly interesting to note that in five years, as many as five directors have been at the helm of state forests.
WHAT DOES POLITICS PROMISE?
There is therefore no shortage of challenges in this area for the future. We asked the clients how they will regulate forest management, whether they think the state is a good owner of forests, and how they intend to solve the burning problem of importing wood from abroad and a large share of domestic ends in heating stoves.
Freedom movement: New reserves, connection of forest-timber production chain
The Svoboda Movement announces that they will promote sustainable, sustainable and multifunctional forest management and improve the operation of the Slovenian State Forests Company: ""We will support the establishment of new forest reserves and regional parks in Kočevski Rog, Kamnik-Savinja Alps and Pohorje and more effective monitoring of the state of the environment and nature. We will change the Forest Act and the forest management strategy, thus ensuring greater control over the management of Slovenian forests. ""
They emphasize that most of the territory of our country is covered by forests, which means that we have a lot of sources of quality and affordable wood: ""Therefore, we think the import of large quantities of wood from abroad is completely unnecessary. , and thus the greatest possible added value of finished wood products, which we will achieve by establishing greater connections between the forest-timber production chain and companies in this field. ""
Left: Amendments to SiDG, ban on imports of crops produced by habitat destruction
In Levica, they are harsh towards the state-owned company SiDG, which has not developed capacity for management in state forests in the six years since its establishment ""and according to the latest available data (SiDG's annual report for 2020) 89 percent of production is transferred to private contractors"". ""So far, government strategies have limited SiDG's share of own production in state forests to a maximum of 20 percent. This has resulted in non-transparent outsourcing, brutal exploitation of private contractors and uneconomical handling of state timber,"" they said.
They add that SiDG has never seriously developed the capacity to establish entire forest-timber chains in Slovenia. ""In Levica, we intend to increase the share of own felling in the state company Slovenski državni gozdovi to more than 50 percent by 2025 with the aim of achieving 100 percent own felling by 2027. By strengthening forest infrastructure and incentives for domestic timber growers, we intend to prevent exports of wood and promote domestic production of quality finished products. ""
In the field of sustainable forest management, they intend to step up efforts to restore and care for forests: ""In order not to turn the forest into a source of CO2 due to natural disasters and too high goals of regular felling from the sink."" ""Although Slovenia has a relatively exemplary and sustainable forest management with imports of certain types of feed, biofuels, rubber products and some meat products, we contribute to the felling of tropical rainforests. To protect them, we will advocate a ban on soybean imports maize and other crops produced by destroying forests, wetlands, peatlands and other habitats, the conservation of which is crucial for climate change mitigation, in areas forcibly stolen by agro-industry from indigenous peoples and cultivated by completely disenfranchised workers and workers in (semi) slave working conditions, ""they add.
LMŠ: The goal is to create recognizable brands
The LMŠ emphasizes that wood is a natural resource of Slovenia, which - with proper management of its potential - should promote the development of the economy and society: ""In forest management, important links between state-owned enterprises and private owners. ""
Awareness of the quality of Slovenian wood should be strengthened and its sale promoted in various forms of so-called 'wood exchanges', and efforts should be made to export sawmill products as Slovenian brands and to maximize the added value of wood and wood products. with a higher level of processing (joinery, furniture, wooden construction and construction of residential and commercial buildings), based on innovative approaches and modern design and marketing, ""say the party of Marjan Šarc.
As they also point out, the program also has the following solutions:
- revision of the Forest Act for better forest management and administration;
- updating the national forest program;
- review of all applicable forest management plans and their compliance with the condition of forests affected by ice and the outbreak of lovers;
- modernization and effective implementation of the measures of the action plan for increasing the competitiveness of the forest-timber chain in Slovenia for the period until 2030;
- regulation of the wood assortment market, which will enable organized and uninterrupted supply of wood for the wood processing industry in Slovenia, with an emphasis on the involvement of private forest owners;
- increasing the mandatory share of domestic timber required in public construction contracts;
- creation of the Slovenian wood brand.
NSi: Increasing the consumption of Slovenian wood
The current practice shows that the state is not a good forest manager, they are clear in NSi, which is otherwise part of the current government, and they also include the Minister of Agriculture Jože Podgoršek. ""Control over felling and sales is poor. We must encourage the development of wood processing, especially the establishment of sawmills and the production of glued wood. We must increase the use of wood in Slovenian construction and industry.""
Let's connect Slovenia: Domestic biomass must become a priority in heating public buildings
Wood is one of the two key natural raw materials, but unfortunately we treat it irresponsibly and its potential is not sufficiently exploited, according to Connect Slovenia: ""The state must accelerate the development of wood processing with the help of subsidies and development funds Domestic biomass (dry distillation, not incineration) must become a priority in heating public buildings, followed by Eco Fund policy. ""
""With an appropriate tax policy, we will also encourage the use of wood as a strategic Slovenian raw material for cheaper construction and consequently lower purchase prices and more environmentally friendly construction,"" they promise, adding that state forests should be of strategic importance to the country. .
SAB: Funds from the sale of wood and water must be directed to the Demographic Fund
The SAB also estimates that there is still a lot of room for maneuver in forest management and the possibility of improvements: ""We are convinced that control in Slovenian forests needs to be improved, and we are announcing an amendment to the Forest Act to regulate this. the possibility for the state-owned company SiDG to carry out all forestry work and purchase of wood in private forests ""
SAB also recognizes the issue of the connection between the forest-timber production chain and companies, which needs to be strengthened. Due to the excessive organizational division of forestry and timber production, the production of wood, primary products and timber products is fragmented and inefficient. SAB will ensure a regular long-term supply of logs from all Slovenian forests, which must enable the greatest possible wood processing in Slovenia, to the highest possible level. ""We will also place great emphasis on detecting illegal timber traders or resellers and unfair competition. We will also focus on preventing significant fluctuations in timber prices,"" they announced.
""Funds from the sale of wood and water must be directed to the demographic fund and used for pensions. Some have oil, we have water and wood, so we must allocate funds from the exploitation of these goods today for the future,"" they suggest.
SD: Overgrown agricultural areas need to be re-arranged for agricultural use or converted into quality forest stands
SD says it will continue its active development policy to revive the wood industry and economy: ""We will establish wood as a recognizable and high-quality Slovenian product. Overgrown agricultural land represents untapped potential. These areas must be re-arranged for agricultural use or converted into quality forest stands. ""
They believe that the state can be a good owner of forests: ""But the quality of state governance depends on strengthening the forest-timber chain by involving local, domestic timber producers, which ensures higher added value of timber. In this context, cooperation with professionals ensure this by setting up wood processing centers and providing access to services in state forests to timber growers (rather than timber traders). ""
SDS: Wood is not primarily an energy source, but a material for industrial processing
We primarily recognize wood as a material for industrial processing, and not as an energy source, but the SDS emphasizes: ""Only wood that is not suitable for further industrial processing and used wood is used as an energy source.""
Responsible forest management is also important for improving the conservation of biodiversity, they continue: ""Our goal is to develop in particular the processing of round wood into semi-finished and higher value-added products; wood as a building material should be used especially in construction and furnishing CO2); shift to timber construction through public procurement; promoting the development of the furniture industry with an emphasis on modern and recognizable design solutions; promotional activities to increase wood use, especially among young people, the public sector and the general public.

(SAB). In the debate, they touched on topics such as the poor demographic picture of Slovenia and the presence of women in politics, spoke about the situation in health care and education, and touched on the rule of law.","

Kako do države, v kateri se bodo mladi odločali za otroke?
Prva tema soočenja je bila demografska slika države. Kociprova je poudarila, da je ključno, da se mladim omogočijo razmere, v katerih si bodo lahko čim prej ustvarili družino. ""Pomembno je, da imajo službo, s katero lahko preživijo sebe in družino, da imajo rešen stanovanjski problem in občutek, da živijo v spodbudnem okolju, v katerem bodo njihovi otroci imeli srečno otroštvo in prihodnost."" Je pa dodala, da imamo v Sloveniji veliko srečo, ker imamo  kvalitetno javno šolstvo: ""Morda so šole – kot vsaka stvar – zaradi razvoja družbe potrebne sprememb, ampak javno šolstvo, ki vsem otrokom omogoča enakovreden start v življenje, je nekaj zelo pomembnega."" Dejala je, da nasprotujejo vsem poskusom privatizacije šolstva.
Jerajeva je poudarila, da zagovarjajo pozitivno družinsko politiko, menijo pa tudi, da bi morali socialno politiko ločiti od družinske in z ukrepi pomagati mladim. ""Sprejeli smo zakon o jamstveni shemi,"" pa je med drugim dejala o ukrepih aktualne vlade. Naštela je tudi nekatere druge: ""V zadnjih dveh letih smo povečali tako otroške dodatke kot sredstva za novorojence, družine, starše smo razbremenili s spremembo zakona o dohodnini, smo pa želeli uvesti tudi socialno kapico, a še ni bilo dovolj podpore."" V SDS sicer ne nasprotujejo zasebnim pobudam na področju šol in vrtcev: ""Če želi nekdo svojega otroka vzgajati po nekih drugih vrednotah, mu moramo to omogočiti, to piše tudi v ustavi.""
Klakočar Zupančičeva je uvodoma dejala, da imamo v Sloveniji z ustavo zagotovljeno svobodno odločanje o rojstvu otrok, kar je prav tako ""pomembno pri tem, kako mladi načrtujejo družino"". ""Smo za to, da se mlade spodbuja, da imajo otroke, in sicer z aktivno politiko zaposlovanja, z dobro stanovanjsko politiko, da tudi pomagamo pri morebitni neplodnosti z biomedicinsko pomočjo, da se zagotovi ustrezno socialno varstvo, predvsem pa da vrtci ostanejo na tako visoki ravni kot zdaj.""  Sicer pa je ocenila, da je po letih, ko je politika na področjih, povezanih z demografijo, počela premalo, čas, da se to spremeni: ""Zavzemamo se za univerzalni otroški dodatek, deset let po prvi zaposlitvi pa naj bo dohodnina za mlade nič."" Glede vrtcev pa je dejala, da želi spomniti na znan dogodek iz zasebnega vrtca pred nekaj leti: ""Javni vrtci so regulirani, pravilno zastavljeni, v zasebnih vrtcih pa se lahko dogajajo stvari, ki so se že dogajale, torej neprimerno ravnaje z otroki."" Na repliko, da za takšne dogodke niso imuni niti javni vrtci, pa je vztrajala, da je ""možnost za to je precej manjša kot v zasebnih vrtcih"". Se je pa po njenem mnenju med epidemijo z otroki ravnalo neprimerno: ""V vrtcih maske, ki so jih morali nositi majhni otroci.  Meni – pa nisem zdravnica – se zdi to neprimerno. Zaradi ravnanja z otroki med epidemijo so se pri marsikom pojavile duševne težave.""
Bregantova je poudarila, da je naloga države, da zagotovi razmere, v katerih bodo mladi z veseljem imeli otroke. ""Da ne bodo obremenjeni s prekarnostjo, da bodo ustrezno plačani. Mladi ne potrebujejo miloščine države, ampak ustrezne razmere, da lahko trdno stojijo na svojih nogah."" Pohvalila pa je delo vrtcev v Sloveniji, tudi na periferiji: ""Želimo si decentralizacije, tudi pametnih vasi, ki pa bodo tudi v dobro starostnikov. Imamo dobro podlago.""
Kljub dolgoletnim obljubam sicer ostaja dejstvo, da so plače prenizke, da mladi zapuščajo državo, da so vrtci, čeprav so za drugega in nadaljnje otroke brezplačni, še vedno dragi, vzgojiteljice pa plačane premalo …
""Zmoti me, da takrat, ko govorimo o mladih, o njih govorimo kot o neki zelo homogeni skupnosti,"" je dejala Hotova. Poudarja namreč, da gre za raznoliko skupnost, saj imajo eni boljša izhodišča kot drugi – tako pri plačilu v službi kot pri reševanju stanovanjskega problema. ""Država mora vsem nuditi enake možnosti."" Med prioritetami je izpostavila gradnjo najemnih stanovanj, odpravo prekarnega dela, ki je ""le korak od revščine"", dolgoročno se zavzemajo tudi za brezplačne vrtce. Nasprotujejo pa zasebnim vrtcem: ""Bojimo se, da kakršna koli privatizacija tega vodi v popolno razslojevanje družbe."" Prav tako se ni strinjala, da bi bili zasebni vrtci za lokalno skupnost cenejši, saj mora investitor takšnega vrtca marsikaj zagotoviti sam.
Plače v vrtcih in javno proti zasebnemu
V nadaljevanju so se dotaknili plač vzgojiteljic in pomočnic vzgojiteljic. Ta težava v mandatu aktualne vlade ni bila rešena, čeprav obstajajo primeri, ko z vsemi dodatki ni dosežena niti minimalna plača.
""V šolstvu ima marsikatera skupina zelo visoke plače, drži pa tudi, da so nekateri plačani premalo,"" je dejala Jerajeva, ki se ji zdi neprimerno, da plačni sistem javnega sektorja omogoča, da je nekdo pod minimalno plačo. ""Toda v dveh letih pri tej sestavi DZ in ko se je vlada morala ukvarjati z epidemijo, ni bilo časa, da bi se odprl plačilni sistem.""
Na izziv voditelja, da pa so se o plačah pogajali v zdravstvu, je dejala, da so bili najbolj obremenjeni: ""Lahko bi se nam sesul sistem, če ne bi ničesar storili.""
Za morebiten prihodnji mandat je napovedala urejanje razmerij v plačnem sistemu – da se mora to dogajati v mirnejšem mandatu.
Bregantova je dejala, da seveda ni nobenega dvoma, da so plače zaposlenih v vrtcih, ki delajo z najmlajšimi, pri 740 evrih in plače mladih zdravnikov pri 940 evrih prenizke. ""Naš javni plačni sistem ni več enoten. Ima takšne anomalije, da ne moremo govoriti, da je to urejeno. To je treba urediti."" Predlagala je pogajanja z vsemi deležniki: ""Zavzemamo se za meritokratsko nagrajevanje."" Izpostavila pa je, da pri vsem skupaj ne gre le za plačilo, ampak tudi za ureditev delovnih razmer.
Maša Kociper je dejala, da je aktualna vlada dialog vodila le z nekaterimi skupinami. ""Vsi se zavedamo, da bo treba na neki točki, ne glede na to, katera vlada bo, ta plačni sistem prevetriti, tako da bodo neka nova razmerja."" Strinjala se je, da so vzgojiteljice plačane premalo: ""Ampak neka resna, odgovorna vlada se vedno vpraša, od kod denar."" Zato nasprotujejo zasebnim šolam in vrtcem, ""kot jih razume desna vlada"": ""Pri nas šole in vrtce razumejo tako, da zasebni vrtec in šolo stoodstotno plača država, posameznik se pa samo odloči, da bo tam neka druga ponudba vzgoje ali varovanja."" V SAB so sicer podprli pobudo občin, ki so želele, da bi občina, če ima dovolj mest v javnih vrtcih, morala izdati dovoljenje za odpiranje dodatnih zasebnih kapacitet. Ocenila je, da je to pravi pristop, saj da bi z odtekanjem denarja v zasebne ustanove sčasoma zmanjkalo denarja za plače v javnih vzgoji in izobraževanju, obnovo šol in tako dalje.
""Odprtje plačnega sistema s PKP 10 je bilo absurd, ki je odprl Pandorino skrinjico,"" pa je poudarila Hotova. Strinjala se je, da treba plačni sistem prenoviti: ""Ampak izključno z dialogom."" Tudi ona sicer meni, da ""lahko na račun zasebnega izgubljamo javno"": ""V trenutku, ko se bo občinam bolj izplačalo podpirati zasebno, lahko v javnem izgubimo. Če bodo tam dali nekoliko višje plače, bomo vzgojiteljice, ki jih imamo zdaj v javnem, izgubili."" Poudarila je, da se ne sme dopustiti, da bi se razgradil javni sistem, za katerega je treba poskrbeti z ustreznimi plačami in razmerami.
""Demonizacija česar koli, tudi zasebnega kapitala, ni umestna,"" pa se ni strinjala Bregantova. ""Vprašati se moramo, kaj pravzaprav potrebujejo naši otroci. Seveda moramo najti ustrezno regulacijo, ampak če se izvaja enak program z enako kakovostjo, potem je prav, da je plačan. Kar se tiče tega, da bodo vzgojiteljice nekje plačane bolje kot drugje, pa je to krasno izhodišče, da se o plačah vzgojiteljic v javnem sistemu začnemo pogovarjati na drugačen način, saj to v resnici ne spodbuja le konkurence, ampak boljše delo na vseh nivojih, tudi državnem,"" je dejala.
130.000 državljanov nima osebnega zdravnika. Kaj zdaj?
Se nam torej v vrtcih lahko zgodi to, kar se dogaja v javnem zdravstvenem sistemu, ko ni zdravnikov? ""Vemo, koliko je tistih, ki ne dobijo osebnega zdravnika, ker so zdravniki pri zasebnikih,"" je izpostavil voditelj.
""To ne bo držalo. Res je, da je 130.000 državljanov ostalo brez zdravnika, v Sloveniji manjka tisoč zdravnikov. V zadnjih desetih letih smo jih približno polovico izgubili, ker so šli v tujino, približno polovica pa jih sploh ne dela v zdravstvu. Kaj je torej narobe z našimi delovnimi razmerami? To moramo nasloviti,"" je dejala Bregantova.
Bregantova je tudi pozvala državljane, naj si ogledajo svoj plačni list in ugotovijo, koliko denarja namenjajo zdravstvu: ""In zavod za zdravstveno zavarovanje, ki bi moral zagotavljati zdravnike, pravzaprav ni mehanizem, v katerem bi, čeprav si zdravstvu 40 let plačeval tako velike vsote, prišel do svojega zdravnika. Kakšne pogodbe imamo državljani z zavodom za zdravstveno zavarovanje?""
""V teh dveh letih smo storili kar nekaj korakov, da težavo rešimo,"" pa je dejala Jerajeva. ""Povečali smo število specializacij, povečali smo vpis na obe medicinski fakulteti, pogovarjali smo se o novih plačnih razmerjih, zagotovili denar za izboljšanje razmer …"" Zdravnikov pa se v dveh letih ne glede na ukrepe ne da narediti, je še poudarila. Rešitev za tiste, ki nimajo osebnega zdravnika, pa vidi v tem, da bi te paciente, dokler se ne zagotovi trajnejša rešitev, zdravniki sprejeli v zameno za nagrado. ""V nadaljevanju pa je treba poskrbeti, da bo kadra dovolj,"" je prepričana. Izpostavila je, da se na pristojnem ministrstvu področje pripravlja kadrovska strategija, ki bo olajšala reševanje izziva. ""Pa še nekaj smo zakomplicirali. V času vlade Mira Cerarja je ministrica Milojka Kolar Celarc v parlament prinesla zakon, ki je bil tudi sprejet, da morajo imeti zdravniki po končani fakulteti in opravljeni specializaciji še pet let imeti mentorja.""
Bregantova je sicer poudarila, da imamo na nekaterih mestih dovolj zdravnikov, ni pa jih dovolj na nekaterih najbolj ključnih. ""80 odstotkov zdravstvenih problemov se lahko reši pri družinskem zdravniku, če ga imaš. Ampak naši mlajši kolegi povedo, da zaradi razmer na primerni ravni tam ne želijo delati. Ostajajo v bolnišnicah, ker je delo tam drugače organizirano in plačano.""
Hotova je dejala, da upa, da bomo ugotovili, kaj je šlo v času epidemije narobe, da se je povečalo število mrtvorojenih otrok. Sicer pa je izpostavila težave na področju ginekologije. ""Podatek, da čez pet let 300.000 žensk ne bo imelo dostopa do ginekologa, je absurden in to moramo popraviti."" Kot rešitev predlagajo dodatna sredstva – med drugim bi dvignili DDV ter zagotovili reorganizacijo in boljše upravljanje. Strinjala se je, da je treba okrepiti raven družinskih zdravnikov, da bo to delo za zdravnike privlačnejše. ""Že na fakulteti jih moramo programsko usmeriti,"" je prepričana. Dejala pa je, da se ""vse začne in konča pri denarju"".
Kociprova je dejala, da v SAB želijo javno zdravstvo, ki pa mora biti učinkovito. ""Vzpostaviti bo treba tudi več nadzora,"" je poudarila. Izpostavila je stisko, v kateri se znajdejo upokojenci, če ostanejo brez družinskega zdravnika: ""Novega ne znajo iskati po spletu, zanje je pomembno, da ga imajo v bližini in lahko pridejo do njega."" Poudarila je tudi nujnost krajšanja čakalnih vrst, za kar bi uporabili tudi zasebne zdravnike. Del nujno potrebnega denarja za zdravstvo pa bi dobili s centralizacijo naročanja, pri katerem se ""izgubljajo milijoni"".
Klakočar Zupančičeva je dejala, da podpirajo javno zdravstvo, med ukrepi pa je izpostavila prestrukturiranje zdravstva in boj proti korupciji: ""Verjetno je denarja dovolj, rešiti pa je treba vprašanje, kam gre. Korupcija v zdravstvu je luknja brez dna.""

Seksizem, fašisti in diktatorji ali zakaj je v politiki malo žensk
V nadaljevanju soočenja so se dotaknili tudi vprašanja majhnega števila žensk v politiki. ""Ženske se težje odločijo za te funkcije. Danes nas zmerjajo s fašisti, diktatorji, in za ženske je to precej težko,"" je ocenila Jerajeva.
Kociprova meni, da se je treba aktivno truditi, da bi ženske privabili v politiko: ""Se pa ženske res težje odločijo, težko je kombinirati družino in delo, mnoge ženske skrbijo še za starše in ob vsem tem biti vedno nasmejan in vse vedeti je res težko.""
Hotova je sicer izrazila nasprotovanje kvotam: ""Ženske smo absolutno enako sposobne kot moški, morale bi imeti enak dostop do vseh delov družbenega življenja. A ni tako. Ženske smo deležne izjemnih žaljivk, seksizma, ravno ta kampanja je pokazala, da kot družba nismo napredovali."" Izpostavila je ukvarjanje spletnih komentatorjev z videzom, ne vsebino, in poudarila težavo žaljivega govora. ""Začel se je v političnem prostoru in se prenesel v vse pore družbe. Lahko se ne strinjamo, ampak sporočilo lahko prenesemo argumentirano,"" je poudarila. Poudarila je tudi, da morajo moški pustiti nekaj prostora ženskam, predvsem pa jih dojemati kot enakovredne. ""Toliko seksizma, kot sem ga bila v parlamentu deležna v zadnjih letih, nisem bila še nikoli,"" je dodala.
Bregantova je dejala, da želi v politiko prinesti empatijo in enakovrednost odnosov.
Klakočar Zupančičeva pa je dejala, da si ni nikoli mislila, da bo pristala v politiki, ker je pri nas ""politika politikantstvo"" in ker se sovražni govor ""širi z vrha navzdol"": ""Ampak sem se odločila za politiko, ker so me nekatere stvari, ki so se dogajale v zadnjih dveh letih,  tako motile, da nisem mogla biti več tiho, čeprav sem bila zaradi tega tudi tarča groženj.""
Ob koncu so se predstavnice strank dotaknile tudi področja pravne države. Medtem ko je Jerajeva menila, da Slovenci malo zaupamo pravni državi, končno pa je dovoljeno tudi kritično govoriti o sodstvu, je nekdanja sodnica Klakočar Zupančičeva menila, da ima aktualna oblast izjemno slab odnos do sodstva, to pa se pred njim ne more braniti, ker ""ima zavezana usta"": ""Sodniki vedo, da bodo tarča javne diskreditacije. Pa veste, kaj to pomeni za sodnika, ki mora pred stranko vzbujati spoštovanje? Mi ne spoštujemo niti odločb ustavnega sodišča, krivimo ga celo za smrt ljudi, ker je ugotovilo neustavnost odlokov, ki so bili neustavni. Potem je pravna država v razsulu. In to moramo zgraditi.""

https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/srbski-nacionalist-seselj-se-umika-iz-politike.html,Serbian nationalist Seselj is retiring from politics,"Serbian nationalist and convicted war criminal Vojislav Seselj has announced his withdrawal from politics. Seselj resigned as leader of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) after receiving just 2.2 per cent of the vote in Sunday's parliamentary elections. In Serbia, at least three percent of the vote is required to enter parliament.","""People rejected me twice and I understood that it was time to retire,"" Seselj said in Belgrade today, according to Serbian media. His son Aleksandar, who is the party's vice-president, said that the party's bodies would decide on the further operation of the SRS in the coming days.
According to the German news agency dpa, Vojislav Šešelj was one of the most prominent instigators of war during the war in the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. With his hostile rhetoric and concrete appeals, he encouraged Serbian soldiers and paramilitary units to commit war crimes in the attacked countries.
In 2018, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia sentenced him to ten years in prison in The Hague for inciting war crimes. As he was already in pre-trial detention between 2003 and 2014, he did not have to serve his sentence.
Seselj and his SRS party have been present on the Serbian political scene for a long time. His most important political protégé and longtime right-hand man was the current Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić. In 2008, he broke up with Šešelj and joined the Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), which he still leads today."

A heartbreaking, fateful, longing and full of twists and turns comedy series, a parody of the creation of television content, answered in a humorous way the questions that are usually asked of viewers.

A group of enthusiasts, led by Slavec, a former pumper and newly appointed program director of PRVAK TV, managed the impossible. Despite constantly throwing logs under their feet, they created the Superk *** e series with incredible ratings. Word of their success quickly spread and stirred up the media space, and this is where the story of the new politically motivated owners from Cyprus begins with the renaming of PRVAK TV to PATRIOT TV.

Telenovela: Patriot TV
The PATRIOT TV team is expecting the procurator of the new owners from Cyprus, the attractive, ambitious and uncompromising media manager Svetlana, who wants to prove herself and create an informative program tailored to the new owners and politicians. She is portrayed by Montenegrin actress Marija Bergam. She joined the established team with the intention of turning television into a propaganda news program and creating a political show tailored to politics. At first, she sees Slavec as a professional, Dončič among television people and the embodiment of all the changes she wants to introduce, but she soon learns the truth about Slavec's success and (in) abilities. Former actors and the Superk *** team are now becoming journalists who will deal with current political topics ... However, they will also hone their acting skills in a special series dealing with Slovenian history, filmed in secret, but in parallel with political propaganda. .

Delo v zdravstvu je za številne predane posameznike poslanstvo, delo opravljajo s skrbjo in veseljem, četudi je delovnih ur veliko, denarja pa pogosto premalo. Obstaja pa tudi veliko manj rožnata podoba slovenskega zdravstva. Tista, kjer slaba organizacija in toksični odnosi med zaposlenimi pomenijo slab izkoristek sredstev, nezadovoljno osebje in slabšo oskrbo pacientov oziroma marsikdaj ti ostanejo celo brez (ustrezne) oskrbe.
Slovensko zdravstvo tako že dlje časa pretresajo zgodbe, iz katerih je razvidno, da medsebojni odnosi med zaposlenimi nikakor niso rožnati. Jasno ali bolj med vrsticami padajo obtožbe o notranjih težavah zdravstvenih ustanov, ki so eden od pomembnih razlogov, da mladi zdravniki odhajajo v tujino, saj imajo tukaj občutek, da pod noge padajo polena, sistem pa deluje proti njim. Znani so tudi primeri odpovedi strokovnjakov zaradi slabih odnosov. Zaposleni, ki odhajajo, pogosto navajajo, da vodstvo ustanove, ki jo zapuščajo, ni znalo zagotoviti ustrezne organizacije dela, preprečiti kadrovske stiske, prisluhniti zaposlenim oziroma ni znalo krmariti med zahtevami dela in privilegiji nekaterih članov kolektiva.
Težava ni nova, se pa politika njenega reševanja praviloma na daleč izogiba, javnost pa zaposluje predvsem z vprašanjem, koliko denarja je še treba nameniti za zdravstvo, čeprav je tudi po tem sprememb, ki bi jih občutil pacient, malo. Zgolj denar namreč v takšnih ustanovah ni rešitev, saj se osrednja težava skriva še nekoliko globlje: v slabem vodenju in slabo postavljenem sistemu, katerega težava je tudi, da se na izzive ne odzove, dokler ni (pre)pozno.
Bo v prihodnjem mandatu kaj drugače?
Gibanje Svoboda napoveduje profesionalne nadzornike: 'Želimo depolitizirati celoten zdravstveni sistem'
""Velik del težav našega zdravstvenega sistema izhaja iz njegove trenutne organiziranosti in upravljanja. Nejasna ločitev med javnimi (državnimi in občinskimi) izvajalci ter zasebno prakso močno načenja transparentnost celotnega zdravstvenega sistema,"" ocenjujejo v stranki Roberta Goloba. Napovedujejo učinkovitejšo porabo sredstev, racionalizacijo poslovanja, boljšo organizacijo oziroma reorganizacijo zdravstvenih zavodov in učinkovitejšo izrabe obstoječih kapacitet z ustrezno stimulacijo vseh zaposlenih: ""Pri ukrepih bomo izhajali tudi iz nedavnih ugotovitev Računskega sodišča o učinkovitosti ureditve javne službe.""
Zagotavljajo, da bodo na vodilna mesta v zdravstvu imenovali ugledne strokovnjake: ""Spremenili bomo sedanjo nadzorno vlogo svetov zavodov in skladno z najvišjimi standardi korporativnega upravljanja njihovo funkcijo nadomestili z nadzornimi sveti s profesionalnimi nadzorniki. S tem želimo depolitizirati celoten zdravstveni sistem. Vsakodnevno politiko je potrebno umakniti iz mehanizmov vodenja zdravstvenega sistema.""
Izpostavljajo tudi kadrovske težave slovenskega zdravstva: ""Veliko zaposlenih za svoje delo v zdravstveni mreži ne prejme pravičnega plačila. Nekateri to kompenzirajo z delom v zasebnih organizacijah ali nepregledno množico različnih dodatkov.  Sistem je posledično vse manj transparenten in vse bolj neučinkovit, kar znižuje zaupanje javnosti in vseh ostalih relevantnih deležnikov v celotno javno zdravstvo. Reševanje kadrovske problematike je zato med pomembnejšimi javnozdravstvenimi prioritetami. Med pomembnimi ukrepi vidimo tudi bolj sistematično ureditev položaja zaposlenih v zdravstveni negi, ki so pomemben, a pogosto spregledan kader v našem zdravstvenem sistemu. Trenutno prav ta kader zaradi slabih pogojev dela in plačila pospešeno odhaja v tujino, kar lahko že na krajši rok močno oteži delovanje celotnega zdravstvenega sistema. V Gibanju Svoboda menimo, da slovenski zdravstveni sistem nujno potrebuje drugačno kadrovsko politiko. Velik neizkoriščeni potencial vidimo v kadrovskem štipendiranju zdravstvenega kadra, ki bi posebno na srednjih šolah spodbudila večje zanimanje za različne zdravstvene programe.""
Levica nasprotuje vodenju zdravstvenih ustanov kot podjetij: 'Zasebno zdravstvo je potrebno popolnoma ločiti od javnega'
Pri Levici menijo, da je stanje v javnih zdravstvenih zavodih potrebno ocenjevati objektivno: ""Drži, da standardi padajo, da se nedostopnost povečuje, da kadra vse bolj primanjkuje in da je vse bolj izčrpan. A razlogi za to ne ležijo toliko v vodenju samih ustanov kot v dejstvu, da se v zadnjem času aktivno vzpostavlja paralelni privatiziran sistem zdravstvenega varstva."" Po njihovem torej najhujše udarce javnemu sistemu zadaja nelojalna konkurenca zasebnikov: ""Namesto da bi tako t. i. zdravniki dvoživke delo opravili v javnih zavodih, prek s.p. delo opravljajo pri zasebnikih in tako aktivno podaljšujejo čakalne vrste.""
Skrbi jih tudi stanje v zdravstveni negi – zaradi, kot pravijo, mizernih plač in dejstva, da se po vseh zavezah in obljubah še vedno niso sprejeli standardi in normativi v zdravstveni negi.
Javno zdravstvo se mora izvajati neprofitno, morebitni presežki sredstev pa morajo ostajati v sistemu, poudarjajo: ""Privatizacija in odsotnost načrtovanja zdravstvene politike sta pripeljala do točke, ko je vse več ljudi brez osebnega zdravnika, kjer se na posege čaka predolgo in kjer so kršene zakonske in ustavne določbe o pravici do zdravja. Zasebno zdravstvo je potrebno popolnoma ločiti od javnega in javnih sredstev, javni sistem pa okrepiti z dodatnimi proračunskim sredstvi. Obenem je potrebno zagotoviti izdatno proračunsko financiranje primarne ravni zdravstva.""
 V zvezi z idejami o menedžerski revoluciji in spremembami v vodenju zdravstvenih zavodov navajajo, da izkušnje iz tujine (Velika Britanija, Roy Griffiths) kažejo, da je t. i. The New Public Management Approach izredno škodljiv za javne zdravstvene sisteme: ""Stroški za administracijo so v ustanovah NHS narasli iz pet odstotkov na 12 odstotkov, povečal se je prenos storitev na zunanje izvajalce. Tako imenovane neklinične zaposlitve – čiščenje, pranje, vzdrževanje in varnost so predali zunanjim izvajalcem. Število zaposlenih v teh dejavnostih je posledično močno upadlo, in sicer iz 260.000 leta 1981 na 157.000 leta 1990. Cilj je bil dosežen in bolnišnice so varčevale, cena pa je bila visoka. Študija o prenosu dela na zunanje izvajalce v NHS je leta 2001 pokazala, da so ti zunanji delavci v NHS v Londonu prejemali manj kot pet funtov na uro, prav tako pa so se jim skrčile druge pravice, kot so dopust in pokojnine. Obenem so standardi čistoče v bolnišnicah upadli, močno poslabšala pa se je tudi kakovost bolnišnične hrane. Kar 10 odstotkov resno bolnih pacientov je bilo v času bivanja v bolnišnici podhranjenih. V Levici zato opozarjamo, da bolnišnic nikakor ne smemo voditi kot podjetij (saj tudi gasilcev in Policije ne vodimo tako). Cilj ne sme biti varčevanje, temveč zadovoljevanje zdravstvenih potreb ljudi. Gre za vprašanje družbenih in političnih prioritet.""
LMŠ moti popoldansko samevanje zdravstvenih ustanov: 'Z drugačno organizacijo bodo čakalne dobe krajše'
""Notranja organiziranost je sicer v rokah direktorja posameznega zavoda, ki mora poskrbeti, da odnosi med zaposlenimi ne vplivajo na njihovo delo. Poskrbeti pa mora, in to je naše pričakovanje, tudi za drugačno organizacijo dela, da ordinacije in operacijske dvorane v popoldanskem času ne bodo samevale, pač pa da bo zdravstvena oskrba ljudem dostopna tudi popoldne – danes pogosto ni,"" pravijo v stranki Marjana Šarca.
Razlog za to je po njihovem, zlasti v bolnišnicah, zasedenost precejšnjega števila zdravnikov s popoldanskim delom pri zasebnikih: ""Z drugačno organizacijo bo tudi javno zdravstvo popoldne učinkovitejše, čakalne dobe pa krajše.""
Vseeno pa menijo, da je ne glede na izzive, ki jih ima javno zdravstvo, edina prava pot ohranjanje in krepitev javnega zdravstva ter ukinitev dopolnilnega zdravstvenega zavarovanja: ""Zdravstvene storitve, ki jih izvajalci ne morejo izvesti, se zagotovijo z nacionalnim razpisom po t. i. kaskadnem sistemu, pri čemer se upošteva vrstni red: javni zdravstveni zavodi, koncesionarji, zasebniki. Za to se zagotovijo oziroma razporedijo razpoložljiva finančna sredstva.""
NSi upe polaga v digitalizacijo zdravstva: 'Zdravstvene zavode je treba preoblikovati tako, da delujejo neprofitno, a po načelih gospodarskih družb'
V NSi pravijo, da v okviru celovite prenove zdravstvenega sistema na področju kadra predvidevamo možnost nagrajevanja zaposlenih po rezultatih dela, pri čemer je nujna jasna določitev standardov in normativov.
""Pomemben korak naprej bo pomenila tudi dejanska digitalizacija zdravstva, ki bo zaposlenim v zdravstvu z administrativno razbremenitvijo prinesla več časa za delo z bolniki. V okviru digitalizacije menimo, da je treba uvesti enoten podporni informacijski sistem, standardiziran sistem zbiranja zdravstvenih podatkov, vključiti telemedicino ter uvesti e-osebni zdravstveni karton in e-zdravstvene izvide,"" poudarjajo.
Kot pravijo, verjamejo, da bo to pomembno vplivalo na boljšo organiziranost in razbremenitev zdravstvenih kadrov: ""Kar bo posledično vplivalo tudi na boljše odnose v ekipah.""
""Obenem je treba zdravstvene zavode preoblikovati tako, da delujejo neprofitno, a po načelih gospodarskih družb,"" še poudarjajo.
Povežimo Slovenijo stavi na piramido za zdravo življenje: 'Krepitev primarne ravni in stimulativen, inovativen način dela med kroženjem'
""Imamo najboljše zdravnike in medicinsko osebje,"" so prepričani v Povežimo Slovenijo. Zagotavljajo, da so glede zdravstva pripravili dober načrt: ""Gradnjo piramide, ki bo državljanu omogočala čimbolj zdravo in čilo življenje. Temeljni gradnik bo oskrba na domu, ker vsi radi čim dlje živimo doma, tudi zadnje dni želimo preživeti z našimi domačimi. Tu ima vlogo telemedicina, vrstniška pomoč, NVO, zdravstvena oskrba na domu.""
Ko gre za sam zdravstveni sistem, pa napovedujejo: ""Krepitev primarne ravni s povišanim vpisom na medicino in stimulativnim, inovativnim načinom dela med kroženjem.""
Veliko potencialov imamo pri informatizaciji, so prepričani: ""S tem bomo dosegli boljšo organizacijo dela, dolgoročno kadrovsko načrtovanje ter transparentnost poslovanja in plačevanja.""
SAB zagotavlja, da ne bodo dovolili, da zdravstveni sistem preide v zasebne roke: 'Predlagamo ustanovitev Agencije za nabave v zdravstvu'
Moderno javno zdravstvo je ena od naših prioritet, zagotavljajo v SAB: ""Nikoli ne bomo dovolili, da zdravstveni sistem preide v privatne roke, saj bi to pomenilo razgradnjo kakovosti in dostopnosti trenutnega sistema.""
""Mnoge stvari na tem področju so skozi leta preveč mirovale, neurejene in nedopustne problematike, kot je na primer dolgotrajna oskrba, pa so se kopičile in poglabljale. Tako je treba na eni strani najprej počistiti okostnjake iz omar, na drugi pa se spoprijeti z novimi izzivi, ki vznikajo vsak dan,"" ocenjujejo v stranki, ki jo vodi Alenka Bratušek.
Velik problem je še vedno korupcija v zdravstvu, izpostavljajo: ""V SAB predlagamo, da centraliziramo nabave v zdravstvu, da ustanovimo agencijo za nabave v zdravstvu – in na ta način poenotimo in znižamo nabavne cene, kar pomeni, da bo več denarja ostalo za storitve in bomo lahko skrajšali čakalne vrste.""
Dotaknili so se tudi tako imenovanih zdravnikov dvoživk: ""Treba je urediti in jasno postaviti pravila za delo zdravnikov.""
SD želi, da je glavno vodilo interes pacienta: 'Prekiniti želimo trend poseganja v strokovno avtonomijo'
""Socialni demokrati nameravamo poseči v sisteme notranje organiziranosti zdravstva s tem, da prekinemo trend poseganja v strokovno avtonomijo in presojo,"" pravijo v stranki, ki jo vodi Tanja Fajon.
""Smiselna notranja organiziranost zdravstvenih ustanov, ohranjanje dobrih kolegialnih odnosov, odločanje o napredovanjih na podlagi sposobnosti in ne politične pripadnosti – vse to mora biti odločeno na podlagi neodvisne in strokovne presoje,"" poudarjajo.
""Glavno vodilo pa mora biti interes pacienta,"" še dodajajo.
SDS poudarja pomen stimulacije za kakovostno delo: 'Pristopili bomo k ciljnemu izobraževanju vodstvenih kadrov v zdravstvu'
""Za zaposlene v zdravstveni negi je Vlada RS zagotovila sredstva za dvig plač,"" poudarjajo v stranki, ki jo vodi premier Janez Janša. ""Zaposleni v zdravstvenih zavodih morajo biti stimulirani za kakovostno delo, obenem pa nagrajeni za opravljen obseg dela,"" poudarjajo.
""Pristopili bomo k ciljnemu izobraževanju vodstvenih kadrov v zdravstvu, potrebno bo tudi usposabljanje članov nadzornih svetov za vodenje in upravljanje zdravstvenih ustanov, ki imajo v članicah Evropske unije status gospodarskih družb splošnega pomena,"" napovedujejo.
""Ustanove bodo vodili zdravstveni menedžerji, ki bodo odgovorni nadzornemu svetu. Vodstva ustanov bodo avtonomna tako glede vodenja ustanov kot nagrajevanja zaposlenih. Uvedli bomo nagrajevanje zaposlenih po učinkovitosti in kakovosti opravljenega dela z uvedbo fiksnega in variabilnega dela plače,"" še poudarjajo in dodajajo, da bodo omogočili sklepanje individualnih pogodb za vrhunske strokovnjake.
Najbolj pomembno je zaupanje v vodstvo
Težava sicer ni izrazito slovenska, izzive zdravstvenih sistemov najdemo po vsem svetu. Zanimiv je denimo primer Avstralije, kjer je leta 2020 raziskava med več kot 1000 mlajšimi zdravniki pokazala, da je velika večina v svoji praksi naredila napake zaradi izčrpanosti in izgorelosti, ki sta jo povzročila prevelika obremenitev in neustrezno kadrovanje. Anketiranci so povedali, da so na to opozorili tudi svoje delodajalce, ki pa so jih odpravili, ne da bi ukrepali. 
Raziskava, v kateri je sodelovalo skoraj 10.000 zdravnikov, ki se usposabljajo, pa je pokazala, da je bil vsak tretji v zadnjih 12 mesecih priča ali tarča toksičnega vedenja na delovnem mestu. Tudi pri nas mladi zdravniki redno opozarjajo na težave, s katerimi se srečajo na začetku svoje poti in številne so vezane prav na toksične odnose.
V sektorju, ki se osredotoča na skrb in ohranjanje življenja ter spodbujanje dobrega fizičnega in duševnega počutja, je takšno stanje več kot zaskrbljujoče. 
Strupena kultura delovnega mesta povzroča resen in stalen stres, posledice pa običajno preidejo tudi na druga področja življenja, kar pogosto negativno vpliva na odnose, zdravje in samozavest ljudi. Vpliva tudi na kakovost dela, ki bi morala biti ravno v zdravstvu najvišja. Tudi zato bi morala biti organizacijska ureditev zdravstva in odnosov v njem zelo visoko na lestvici prioritet politike.
V Avstraliji so sestavili nekaj priporočil, med drugim so izpostavili, kako pomembno je, da v ustanovi vlada kultura odgovornosti in da je komunikacija kulturna, odprta, pogosta, vključuje povratne informacije in ljudem omogoča, da so slišani. In še glavna sestavina: pomembno je, da učinkovito vodstvo ustanove uživa zaupanje.

However, before we go to the polls on April 24, many are wondering how the future government will face possible re-challenges in this area. We therefore asked clients how they would manage a potential new epidemic and how they would contribute to restoring confidence in vaccines and official medicine.","In Slovenia, the epidemic of a new coronavirus disease was officially declared on March 12, 2020, the next day the government of Janez Janša took power and began to take new measures to curb the epidemic, which drastically limited public life in the country. We first witnessed the cancellation of the epidemic on May 31, 2020, it was declared again on October 18, 2020, and on June 15, 2021, it was officially canceled by the government again.
In November last year, a new version of the coronavirus appeared in South Africa, dubbed omicron by the World Health Organization and described as worrying, as it spread rapidly due to the unusually high number of mutations. Fortunately, it has been shown to cause less chance of severe disease. The epidemic began to decline and - most importantly - the number of hospitalizations in Slovenia decreased with the increasing level of infection and vaccination. Slovenia ranks 23rd among the 27 EU countries in terms of the share of fully vaccinated population, which is 57.9 percent. Only four countries are behind it: Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
Controversy over vaccination and differing government action have caused divisions and many social hardships in society, and the epidemic has exposed problems that have been building up in healthcare for years. Not only did they stop the implementation of many programs, which made the diagnosis and emergency treatment of many patients too late, new covid wards had to be formed that needed additional nursing teams. The lack of staff, especially nurses, is a cancer of Slovenian healthcare, which we have been drawing attention to for at least a decade.
It is clear that we will eliminate the consequences of the epidemic long before we go to the polls on April 24, but many are wondering how the future government will face possible renewed challenges in this area. The Minister of Health Janez Poklukar announced a few days ago that he would leave the proposal for the vaccination program for 2022 to the Minister for adoption in the next term of the government.
Therefore, we asked the parties that the latest opinion polls show in the upcoming parliamentary elections how they would manage a potential new epidemic and what measures they would take, as well as how they would contribute to restoring confidence in vaccines and official medicine. shaken (global) political decisions over the last two years.
Freedom Movement: The treatment of covid patients will be placed in the existing health care system
The Freedom Movement said that the basic condition for effective management of the epidemic is to increase people's trust in government structures. ""In the Freedom Movement, we will set a different, regionally coordinated strategy for treating obvious patients, so that treatment is placed in the existing health care system - this will achieve equal treatment of all patients and ensure the smooth operation of the rest of the health care system. umbrella crisis multidisciplinary expert group.In order to raise confidence in vaccines, we will raise awareness of the population and improve their health literacy, ""they said.
They also announced that they would support the amendment to the Infectious Diseases Act (ZNB), which was prepared by civil society in cooperation with the profession. ""The amendment to the ZNB must not be based solely on corrections and proposals from the legal profession, but must be formed by a multidisciplinary team. All preventive measures and the need for vaccination against the spread of infection will need to be supported by scientific evidence. therefore, we will take as a basis the law already drafted by the Legal Network in cooperation with the profession. ""
Left: Our position on compulsory or voluntary vaccination is not unequivocal
Just as we know of various infectious diseases, responses to epidemics, restrictive measures and vaccination are also specific. Therefore, it is impossible to answer the question unequivocally, the Left pointed out. ""At the same time, there are clear guidelines as to the minimum and necessary conditions for controlling epidemics. Restrictive measures must be based on scientific facts and data and must be aimed at protecting human health and life. They must apply equally to all and be properly communicated. , otherwise the trust of the general public is collapsing (this has happened in Slovenia). ""
They stressed that vaccination is the most effective and cheapest public health measure against infectious diseases. ""As a society, we have successfully overcome infectious diseases through vaccination, which have caused many deaths and serious health consequences in human history. Therefore, the NIJZ data is worrying that the vaccination of preschool children in Slovenia is declining. The consequences of these infectious diseases can be very severe, such as measles, which can lead to blindness, movement and speech problems, and death, which in children usually leads to severe pneumonia, which can lead to hearing loss, brain damage and brain damage. Redness is a particularly dangerous disease that is transmitted to the fetus in 90% of pregnant women and still causes 700,000 deaths a year worldwide.Other consequences of the disease are also severe: deafness, eye damage, congenital heart disease, mental There is no specific treatment for rubella, ""they said.
Therefore, the Left supports compulsory vaccination in cases where irreparable consequences for public health may arise. However, they point out that a major drawback is the fact that vaccines are not a public good and are not accessible to everyone, but are ""patented products and protected goods in the hands of global corporations"". ""These are at the forefront of a multibillion-dollar global industry that primarily pursues profit. Thus, covid-19 vaccines are still not available to everyone in the global periphery. We are therefore committed to abolishing patents and intellectual property rights - at least for products designed ensuring public health - and for the public ownership of pharmaceutical companies. This would mean that manufacturers would also pursue the goal of ensuring human health, not profit. ""
Given that a huge amount of public funds is allocated for the development and also for the purchase of vaccines, there is no reason for the profit to escape into private hands, they say in Levica. ""Our position on compulsory or voluntary vaccination is ambiguous. The fact is that science must be trusted in professional matters and the benefits and risks must be weighed against public health. Public confidence in restrictive measures is key to these measures working. . ""
LMŠ: It will be necessary to build trust and eliminate intolerance between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated
Confidence in the management of the epidemic stems from trust in the managers of the epidemic. This is connected with the appropriate communication of both politics and the profession, they emphasize in LMŠ. ""Given the communication with which the government has often addressed people insultingly for two years and treated them as adversaries rather than allies, trust will first need to be established, intolerance between vaccinated and unvaccinated will be eliminated and tolerant and respectful coexistence will be restored.""
Managing the epidemic is also leading by example, and the attitude towards vaccination is also connected to this, they are convinced. ""Trust will be restored when the profession knows and is able to present the measures in a way that people will understand and set an example in their implementation. It is expected that a certain proportion of people will always have different views on vaccination or spread doubts about official medicine. , so it is crucial here that both politics and the profession know and are able to explain why a measure is necessary and what its effect will be. ""
NSi: Proper communication with the public will be needed
NSi warns that the management of the epidemic must in any case be carried out in close cooperation with the profession. ""In the event of a new epidemic, special care should be taken to communicate properly with the public. The epidemic of covida-19 was not always appropriate,"" they admit.
In general, according to international organizations, Slovenia acted appropriately during the epidemic, but the biggest problem was the lack of people's confidence in vaccination, which according to NSi is probably a combination of several factors - general society, political tensions, divisions, errors in communication at several levels. and the lack of media support for government measures, and the general reluctance of Slovenes to vaccinate, even when it comes to other diseases.
Let's connect Slovenia: Comprehensive, fast and efficient communication is key
The Connect Slovenia movement, consisting of the parties Konkretno, Zeleni Slovenije, SLS, NLS and Nova Socialdemokracija, said that the current epidemic has taught us that comprehensive, fast and efficient communication about the measures taken and possible further steps is crucial. citizens understand the situation.
""In addition, it taught us how important the potential of public health is. One of the biggest problems was the efficient operation of the subsystems, which is why more attention needs to be paid to evaluating and implementing existing crisis response plans,"" they said.
SAB: Any mandatory testing will remain free
The SAB announced that it would return the best experts to all professional bodies managing the epidemic (NIJZ, government advisory group) and set up an expert group to communicate the course of the epidemic and inform the public.
""For basic assistance in the treatment of patients with covid-19, we will train a larger number of soldiers. (Possible) mandatory testing will remain free for all and a standard to prevent the spread of disease and eliminate infected from the system. provide sufficient supplies and quality materials (masks, disinfectants, tests, respirators, etc.) for the whole of Slovenia, ""they said, adding that they will enforce the measures in accordance with the law and in accordance with the Constitution. ""The measures will be announced, logical and without daily changes. We will not separate citizens into first-class and second-class. The government's website will contain all the information about the epidemic that is currently the concern of civil society,"" they added.
SD: Addressing people respectfully and without threats
The Social Democrats said they would rely on the epidemiological profession to manage the epidemic. We would strengthen trust in public institutions and science, foster a culture of dialogue and cooperation, and lead by example. ""People would be addressed respectfully and without threats. Epidemics would not be used to change the values ​​and structure of Slovenian society. based on the recommendations of epidemiologists, ""they explained.
According to them, the primary means of managing a potential new epidemic are the empowerment of the profession and its complementary policy approach. ""A well-thought-out communication strategy that treats citizens as responsible individuals is essential to build trust in vaccines. We need to communicate information to citizens in an effective and respectful way, not by orders.""
SDS: Consistent implementation of self-protection measures
The SDS warns that consistent implementation of self-protection measures is important. One of the most important measures to curb the epidemic is also rapid testing for infectious disease. Vaccination, however, is the most effective measure to protect against the disease. ""People who are infected should stay at home and not walk among people. The most important things are self-isolation and that people know when to seek help and visit a doctor by prior telephone arrangement. Workers who can perform telework should work from at home, ”listed some of the more important measures they would introduce in the event of a potential new epidemic
The proportionality of the measures is especially important, they added. We cannot ignore the fact that modern medicine has overcome and eradicated a number of infectious diseases (diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, TB, black goat) by vaccination in the last century, when the vaccination of the population in a certain environment was high enough. to restore confidence in science and scientists and empower them to be critical of the diverse publications of quasi-experts on social media. The field of infectious diseases poses a major challenge for the NIJZ, which is responsible for vaccination and public awareness, ""they added.

A closed New Zealand or relaxed Swedish approach?
While the adoption of measures to prevent the spread of new coronavirus infection in the European Union was more or less uniform - Slovenia has always followed the example of Austria and Germany - Sweden and New Zealand have taken a diametrically opposite approach.
New Zealand's response to the epidemic has been one of the most successful in the world, according to most research. The island nation, which immediately closed its borders and completely isolated itself from the rest of the world, successfully navigated the first 18 months of the pandemic with its hermetically sealed system until vaccines became available to all, leading to very low covid-19 mortality. Life expectancy has even increased during this period. Protecting public health also meant protecting the economy, leading to relatively rapid economic growth and low unemployment.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has earned a number of criticisms, as well as praise, for her quick action - for example, she stopped public life for three days due to a single case of infection. While she has been criticized by many for her vision of zero covida-19 cases being unfeasible, polls have shown her support at home - according to a Spinoff poll, as many as 80 percent of respondents rated the government's response to the epidemic as good, almost 60 percent as excellent.
Sweden has taken a completely different tactic in the fight against the new coronavirus - instead of stopping public life altogether, it has chosen a softer, more open approach. There were a few legislative measures, but for the most part the authorities only issued recommendations that the Swedes simply followed. Restaurants, bars and shops remained open, children under the age of 16 went to school all the time, wearing protective masks was not mandatory, and over time it became recommended in health facilities and nursing homes. But even though the country was considered an oasis of normal life for a long time, it was later criticized for its risky strategy of creating herd immunity.
A study published in the journal Humanities & Social Sciences Communications showed that Sweden had a higher mortality rate from covid-19 than its surrounding Nordic countries, according to ABC News. “Sweden’s response to the pandemic has been unique and marked by a morally, ethically and scientifically questionable approach resulting from structural problems in society,” wrote a team of authors from Sweden, Belgium, Norway and the US. ""They put more emphasis on protecting their 'image' than saving and protecting lives,"" they said. According to the website Our World and Data, at the end of December 2020, Sweden recorded an average of 44 deaths due to covid-19 per million population. Denmark recorded five deaths per million population, Norway 0.5 and Finland 0.3. In January this year, when the omicron version was already prevalent in the world, Sweden was already doing better and recorded five deaths per million inhabitants.
What have we learned in the two years of the epidemic?
In view of New Zealand's successful results, the British Guardian has highlighted things that have proven to be effective and could benefit other countries in the future if they adhered to them as well.
Principles. At the time of the pandemic, the New Zealand government has always emphasized that the measures they are taking are primarily focused on protecting public health. This starting point was reinforced by key principles: leadership that took the opinion of the profession into account, an emphasis on fairness and partnership with the Maori, caution in uncertain situations, and a tendency to create appropriate conditions for future health care.
Effective communication and correct interpretation of the threat. Pandemics in themselves pose a threat to the entire population, and the behavior of individuals has a major impact on other people. The relationship in the sense of “We will have to learn to live with this” is acceptable in the omicron version, but it is problematic and creates pressure on vulnerable groups. Instead, we must strive to promote collective health security, take collective action and strengthen the role of those in charge.
Transparency and political consensus. In the initial phase of the epidemic, countries sought to reach a comprehensive agreement on dealing with the epidemic. Such agreements have largely failed, responses have become increasingly political and have led to poor decisions such as e.g. premature lifting of certain safeguards. Politicians therefore need to re-examine the mechanisms by which they seek transparency and political consensus.
Health infrastructure. The pandemic has also exposed a number of public health problems in New Zealand, such as the catastrophic outbreak of contaminated drinking water in Havelock North and the measles epidemic. These problems can be attributed in part to the fragmentation of public health infrastructure. The shortcomings highlighted by the epidemic can be remedied by reforming or upgrading the health system. It is important that effective health services are accessible to all.
Effective epidemic management tools. The response to the pandemic has called on countries to develop tools to deal with this threat as soon as possible. In New Zealand, these included, inter alia, the development of a national border and quarantine management system, a national vaccination register, a system for managing individuals with covid-19 and their contacts, and the adoption of rules on interpersonal distance and the use of protective masks.
Appropriate indoor conditions. After a pandemic, we will certainly remember how important ventilation is in preventing the transmission of respiratory infections. This awareness has strengthened the use of protective masks and the provision of indoor ventilation. But much remains to be done to ensure that indoor ventilation is high quality and cost-effective all year round, while not affecting our thermal comfort.
The covida-19 epidemic has taught us a lot, but this pandemic, and perhaps some other pandemic threat in the future, will remain a challenge. It will be necessary to focus on basic principles, effective communication and achieving consensus, while constantly upgrading health systems, concludes The Guardian.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/cetrti-shod-za-znanost-proti-ponovni-degradaciji-raziskovalne-dejavnosti.html,Fourth Rally for Science Against the Regradation of Research Activity,"With a new meeting for science under the motto Against the degradation of research activity, Slovenian researchers drew attention to the reckless establishment of new public research institutes that do not meet established quality criteria.","""We have barely managed to get more funding, more autonomy of science and a new law on scientific research and innovation, these acquisitions are already under threat,"" wrote the coalition For Science and Development, which consists of the organizing committee of the Assembly for Science. - KOsRIS and the Rectors' Conference of the Republic of Slovenia.
The organizers called on researchers and others on the social network Facebook to join the meeting, thus informing current politicians that the establishment of new public research institutes without meeting quality criteria undermines professionalism. But the ministry replies that ""the fear of the scientific research sphere that the creation of a new public research institute would jeopardize its existing or future financial position is completely unnecessary, all the more so because funding for science will only increase in the coming years.""
Speakers at the meeting were critical of the establishment of new higher education and research institutes, which are the result of purely political decisions and without prior broad professional judgment. They also presented their demands, including consideration and autonomy of science, transparent distribution of research resources, an independent Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology and the regulation of wage disparities and raising the salaries of young scientists and professional associates.
The assembly is also supported by the Alliance for Democratic and Just Slovenia, which believes that ""political bribery in science and higher education has reached a new bottom thanks to autocratic rule"". According to them, the money for investments in the knowledge society is now flowing into fictional and unsubstantiated party projects.
This is the fourth meeting for science. With the previous ones, they pointed out the poor state of science and the problems in research work, especially unregulated funding.
Stromajer: 'Another in a series of harmful moves'
According to Jernej Štromajer, former State Secretary for Higher Education and Science and SD candidate in the parliamentary elections, this is another in a series of harmful moves by the current government. ""Ever since the appearance of the current government team, we have witnessed attacks on the autonomy and excellence of science and higher education,"" he warns.
During the covida-19 epidemic, the government included in one of the anti-crown measures (PKP6) an article according to which the New University owned by Peter Jambrek would be allowed to extend its accreditation without checking the conditions, but the Constitutional Court repealed this article of the intervention law. conditions for obtaining accreditations of higher education institutions.
Also in February, the government issued decisions on the dismissal and appointment of new heads of three directorates of the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport. The new management was given to the directorates for higher education, for investments and for pre-school education and primary education. Among them, Jano Javornik Skrbinšek, Director General of the Directorate for Higher Education, was relieved of her post. ""This left the higher education sphere without an excellent scientist and a well-known higher education professor abroad, who had the opportunity to lead the directorate for higher education for too short a time,"" warns Štromajer.
With a parliamentary proposal and no government opinion, a private institution was nationalized, whose former dean is the current government minister, who remained a minister even after the party that proposed him for the ministerial post left the government, Štromajer warns. The Grm Novo mesto Institute and the Minister of Agriculture Jože Podgoršek are in mind.
In January this year, the government intervened in the Public Agency for Research (ARRS). The government issued a decision appointing Mitja Lainščak as v. d. the Director of the Agency. ""Instead of knowledge and references, the condition for the position was probably membership in a specific program group or friendly connections of political decision-makers according to the regional key from the left bank of the Mura, or before that joint membership in the board of another association,"" he said. opinion points out Štromajer.
""Instead of excellent science and serious strategic consideration of where to go with limited funding for higher education and science, we should get a new public research institute and a new public faculty in a few days, both without serious needs analysis or development plan, only with a vision of eligibility. funds, ""Štromajer warns.
""We must be aware that the situation in Slovenian science and higher education is not rosy. Our higher education and science no longer need fragmentation and partial party projects. We need a public commitment to excellence and commitment to offer young researchers at the beginning of their careers and to young doctors and doctors of science, ""adds Štromajer.
The ministry rejects the criticism
However, the Ministry of Education announced today that the funds for scientific research activities are significantly increasing during the term of this government. ""In the field of science, budget investments in science in 2022 will increase by EUR 44.3 million (by 13.7) compared to the adopted budget for 2022, and by EUR 66.1 million compared to the realization of 2021 (by 21.8%). ) and amount to EUR 368,737,424. In 2023, the funds will increase by an additional EUR 26.8 million (by 7.2%) compared to 2022 and will amount to EUR 395,549,750. ""
The new Act on Scientific Research and Innovation Activity, which, among other things, enables the stability and autonomous development of scientific research activity and its performers, provides for an increase in funding in the future as well. ""The target is to allocate 1% of gross domestic product (GDP) of public funds to scientific research with a growth of 0.08% of GDP annually, which means that the budget for science will double by 2025.""
We have 16 scientific research institutes in Slovenia, of which 15 in Ljubljana and only one in Koper, so the policy of decentralization is even more necessary in the field of scientific research, as this is the only way to activate as much potential as possible and provide conditions for applied research. they still state at the ministry."

Slovenian Minister Logar explained that talking about an interim fishing agreement at this stage is not the right name.","
In Zaprešić, Croatia, Foreign Minister Anže Logar met with the Foreign Ministers of Croatia and Italy, Gordan Grlić Radman and Luigi Di Mai, as part of tripartite cooperation in the northern Adriatic. Logar and Grlić Radman also spoke about the ""agreement on the agreement"" on fishing in the Piran Bay. In this sense, they recalled the talks between the Prime Ministers of Slovenia and Croatia, Janez Janša and Andrej Plenković, in Zagreb last week. ""I cannot confirm that a common fishing area has been agreed, but I can confirm the agreement on the agreement,"" said Grlić Radman. ""We have never had such good cooperation in the last 30 years as we have with the current government. We are trying to find a model that will include everyone, Slovenian and Croatian fishermen, and I think we are on the right track,"" he added.
""Last week, the two prime ministers made it very clear that we are moving from a period when the border issue was a matter of division and disputes to a period when we are all aware of the need for solutions that will gradually lead to the arbitral tribunal's decision."" ""deal deal"" commented Logar. ""Talking about an interim fisheries agreement at this stage is not the right name. What I can say is that we regularly coordinate views with the minister on individual open issues, that we agree that the policy of punishment is not the right policy, that solutions must be found. enable people on both sides to live and work normally, specifically fishermen on both sides, ""Logar added.
""In this particular case, I can ensure that none of the solutions adopted would prejudge or in any way affect the arbitral tribunal's ruling, but that there is enough mutual trust in both diplomacies to find appropriate solutions in the next term,"" he said. he added. ""If we have not yet discussed this fisheries agreement in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, it only means that this agreement has not yet been in such a form as to be presented to MEPs,"" Logar explained.
In a joint statement adopted at today's meeting, Ministers Logar, Grlič Radman and Di Maio strongly condemned Russia's military aggression against Ukraine and expressed solidarity and support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people. They stressed the need to prevent the war in Ukraine from spilling over into the region. Logar and Di Maio called for the EU to adopt a new, fifth package of sanctions against Russia as soon as possible.
In a joint statement, the ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the joint cooperation and integration of Slovenia, Croatia and Italy to make the northern Adriatic an area of ​​growth and development. The three areas of enhanced cooperation include connectivity, environmental protection and the blue economy. The first working group is led by Slovenia, the second by Croatia and the third by Italy.
When it comes to connectivity, the ministers called on the competent ports and infrastructure managers, who signed the declaration of the Northern Adriatic Ports Association (Napa), to strengthen mutual cooperation in freight transport and to improve infrastructure connectivity. The ministers pointed out that they were aware of the limited road and rail connections between the ports of Trieste, Rijeka and Koper. They agreed to look for ways to improve this situation.
In the field of the blue economy, ministers will explore the possibility of developing partnerships between industry and academia in internship programs for the blue economy sector and specific activities to update university curricula according to industry needs.
In the field of environmental protection, they confirmed their readiness to continue cooperation and the periodic exchange of information on their contribution to the objectives of the European Union's Biodiversity Strategy to 2030. They also confirmed their participation in joint activities to implement measures to invasive species, as well as to continue joint activities in monitoring migratory species.
""In the last year, we have managed to create concrete cooperation, especially in three areas that we consider crucial, both for strengthening our relations and for our sea,"" Grlić Radman told a news conference, adding that cooperation is gaining even more importance due to the current energy crisis, which requires the diversification of additional energy sources.
Also on this point, the Croatian minister recalled the recent talks between the prime ministers of Slovenia and Croatia, who last Monday discussed the possibility of Croatian participation in the construction of the second block of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant and the expansion of the Lučko-Zabok-Rogatec gas pipeline. Logar also agreed that the role of the Adriatic in diversifying natural gas sources should be strengthened."

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said in an address to his supporters after winning a fourth consecutive term. As he added, they will remember this victory ""for the rest of their lives"", as they had to defeat many opponents on the way to it. Among them, he listed the Hungarian left, bureaucrats in Brussels, the international media and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.","Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz party won a landslide victory in Sunday's parliamentary elections in Hungary, winning 54 percent of the vote after counting 90 percent and expected to have a two-thirds majority in parliament again - 135 of 199 seats. The opposition led by Peter Marki-Zay won 35 percent of the vote and is expected to have 56 seats in the new parliament.
Orban, for whom this will be his fourth consecutive term and his fifth in total, described the election results as a ""great victory"". ""We have achieved such a convincing victory that they can see it from the Moon, and certainly from Brussels as well!"" he told his followers on Sunday night when he declared victory.
The Hungarian election campaign was marked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which put under scrutiny Orban's long-standing collaboration with Russian President Vladimir Putin. And Orban responded accordingly after the victory - he described Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as one of the ""opponents"" he had to defeat during the campaign. ""We will remember this victory for the rest of our lives because we have had to fight many opponents,"" he said, listing his political enemies, including the Hungarian left, ""bureaucrats"" in Brussels, international media and the Ukrainian president. “We’ve never had so many opponents at the same time,” he said.
In his recent address to EU leaders, Zelensky accused Orban of hypocrisy and called on him to finally decide whether he is on the side of Russia and its President Vladimir Putin or on the side of Ukraine and Europe.
Orban also recalled ""friends"" in his speech. ""The world can see that Hungary has a good heart for its American friends, Poles, Italians, Spaniards, Serbs, Austrians. Tonight in Budapest, the whole world could see that Christian Democracy, conservative and patriotic politics have won. We are sending a message to Europe that this is not the past, this is the future, ""he pointed out, adding:"" We have defended the sovereignty and freedom of Hungary. ""
Marki-Zay: The elections were not democratic and free
His opponent Marki-Zay, who has led the united opposition for the first time so far, has already conceded defeat. He said he was sad and disappointed as well as shocked as he did not expect such a convincing victory for Fidesz. ""I do not want to hide my disappointment, my grief (...) We knew it would be uneven ground. We acknowledge that Fidesz received a huge majority of the vote. But we still say the election was not democratic and free,"" he insisted.
He reiterated that they fought in extremely unequal conditions against a campaign of ""hatred and lies"". Fidesz, in his view, did not win honestly and honorably, but by “propaganda”. As he recalled, they were forced into the fight to step into ""with their hands tied and a spear in their back"". The opposition does not dispute the result of the elections, but only that the elections were democratic and free, he explained. ""We are not discussing Fidesz's victory, we are discussing whether these elections were democratic and even. We will stay in this country, stand by our side, hold hands and we will not let go. Whatever the election results, hard times are coming ""We know they will blame us, we will be scapegoats. That is why it is more important now than ever to hold on and not let go,"" he urged.
On Sunday, Orban, when asked by journalists, insisted that the elections were fair and open, and that everyone in the campaign had the opportunity to convince voters.
Approximately eight million eligible voters in Hungary had the opportunity to cast their ballots, with turnout reaching 67.8 percent by 6:30 p.m., according to official figures. In Hungary, 199 members of the unicameral parliament are elected by 106 directly in the constituencies, with a relative majority being enough to win, and the remaining 93 elected directly from party lists.
Due to doubts about the legitimacy and fairness of the elections, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has decided to send more than 200 international observers to Hungary, and has already indicated several serious problems in its interim report. Among other things, she is concerned that ""the official functions of the government are mixed with the activities of the election campaign or are used as a tool of this campaign"". She also warned of the danger of ""tactical migration of voters"" to those constituencies where the closest race is in store."

ZPM Ljubljana Moste-Polje records a lot of calls in this regard and warns that landlords are violating the law in this way. ""But the tenants are scared, many of them can't stand up for themselves,"" says lawyer Tjaša Tomažin Raspotnik. The black market is also a problem; many landlords are reluctant to enter into a lease, and sometimes set out straight bizarre terms. Tenants - often families with children - land on them because they simply don’t see another way out if they don’t want to land on the road.","""We rent the apartment to a vegetarian who practices yoga - an Asian-oriented soul.""
""The lease is concluded for two months, certified by a notary, the amount of certification is paid by the tenant. The security deposit is ten monthly rentals. Before moving in, the tenant must submit an original certificate of impunity. (...) All persons wishing to live in the apartment , must be stated on the rental agreement, each registered person must submit the last three payslips. ""
""The rent for the room is 400 euros plus costs.""
""The apartment is rented exclusively to foreigners, couples without children and pets. The tenant assumes payment of the composition of the lease.""
""The apartment is shared by the owner one weekend a month.""
""We are looking for a person with a great sense of hygiene and ethical relationships.""
Above you can read just a few quotes we found among current real estate ads. Bizarre conditions that are likely to make many people laugh, but for those who urgently need to move into a new apartment, only deeper distress.
According to their lawyer Tjaša Tomažin Raspotnik, the Association of Friends of Youth (ZPM) Ljubljana Moste-Polje receives a lot of calls from users asking for help, as landlords (without culpable reasons) ""throw"" them out of the apartment. The main reasons: the owners want to sell the apartment as soon as possible, as real estate prices are at their peak, or after a few months of living they demand a significantly higher rent, saying that this is the situation on the market and they can afford it.
""They don't want to hear about the subsidized rent, they prefer to rent on the black""
One of the users of ZPM Ljubljana Moste-Polje shared her story with us, but she wanted to remain anonymous. ""Families are in great need of this, for them exposure means resenting the current landlord, and at the same time risking being recognized by the future landlord because they are in a situation where they will have to look for a new apartment or are already looking for one,"" he said. they explained to us at ZPM Ljubljana Moste-Polje.
A mother, let's call her Alenka, ran away from her violent partner with small children a few months ago. That it was only a matter of time, even though it was a big and difficult step for her, she says. The biggest concern, however, is where she will live, as the prices of rental housing on the market are enormous. ""Fortunately, I received a subsidy, but on the other hand, it is difficult, as landlords avoid tenants who would cover part of the rent with a subsidy,"" she said.
Why? ""Honestly, this also amazes me, because in this way we would have the funds for rent, or at least part of them guaranteed every month,"" says Alenka, adding: ""My experience is that they don't want to hear about it, because then they would have to sign a lease. , which should also include the real price of the rent, which is as much as the tenant actually pays for the apartment. . ""
For a good 50 square meters 700 euros rent and more than 300 euros costs
However, when she found a suitable apartment and the landlord agreed to conclude a lease agreement, new problems soon arose. Although they signed a contract for one year, after less than six months, the landlord informed her that she had to move out of the apartment because the property was for sale.
The mother found herself in great distress, as the children had just gotten used to the new environment, where they also attend primary school, and there is no comparable apartment in this neighborhood. For a good 50 square meters, a large apartment costs 700 euros every month (with the help of a subsidy). ""The costs change from month to month, I pay from 300 to more than 400 euros,"" says Alenka. When she asked the landlord to show her the bills, as the costs didn't seem real to her, he teased her if he even knew what the price increases were, and finally scolded her for asking if he had to show her the bills. consulted with his lawyer. ""Then there are always some excuses: that he called a lawyer, but she didn't answer, or that he doesn't have time and the like,"" says Alenka.
""The apartment belongs to the sharing of common areas, such as a woodshed""
Among other things, we came across an ad online, which is difficult to go unnoticed, as the photos of the property are more reminiscent of a prison cell than an apartment. The description of the apartment ""in a great location in the center of Ljubljana"": ""The studio has 19.5 m2 of net living space, no balcony or basement, and it has to share common areas such as a woodshed. The apartment was completely renovated in 2019 (... ) and is also suitable for investment (regular broadcast or Airbnb). ""

""He threatened me to go out, or his 'friends' would visit me.""
Lawyer Tjaša Tomažin Raspotnik, who is acquainted with the case of our interlocutor, points out that landlords cannot terminate a lease without a fault. ""But tenants are scared, and many can't stand up for themselves,"" he said. He emphasizes that the relationship between the tenant and the landlord is very important, so he always advises people who find themselves in this situation to start looking for another apartment in any case. ""But you have to know that no one can throw them on the street overnight.""
On the one hand, users often do not know what their rights are and when the landlord can withdraw from the contract, and on the other hand, landlords are not aware of legal obligations or use the hardship and lack of information of tenants: ""Whether it is termination for a valid or unfounded reason (this is not due to fault or a reason stated in the contract) is possible only if the landlord provides the tenant with another suitable apartment. means that it is considered suitable housing - in addition to the definitions from Article 10 of this Act - which in comparison with the current apartment in no other important circumstances does not significantly worsen the living conditions of the tenant and persons living with him in the apartment, ""explains Tomažin Raspotnikova.
In the event of a fault, the lease contract must be terminated by a lawsuit, when the court in the proceedings checks the existence of the fault and the justification of the termination, the lawyer added. However, if the apartment is sold, the change of ownership does not affect the existing tenancy; each time the acquirer of ownership of the apartment enters into the legal position of the landlord.
Tomažin Raspotnikova also informed Alenka's landlord about these legal provisions. She did not receive her letter the best. According to Alenka, he perceived it as an attack. ""There were also threats, among other things, he told me to go out or his 'friends' would visit me.""
Because he no longer wants to live in such a hostile environment, especially because of the children, he is now looking for a new apartment. In doing so, it faces similar nonsense as we stated at the beginning of this article. ""The last time I called for an apartment, the owner told me that one of the conditions is that he can enter the apartment at any time and how many times, of course unannounced,"" says Alenka.
Tomažin Raspotnikova adds that tenants should persist until they come across a 'normal' landlord. “It’s really hard, but there are more, but they’re hard to find and the search takes longer,” the lawyer concludes.
System solutions are not in sight
Housing issues in Slovenia have been burning for many years, even decades. Although such and other stories often appear in public, which show that politics should take certain measures, this does not happen.
The guests in the second pre-election confrontation, led by Jani Muhič, will also discuss why this is the case today at 8 pm on POP TV. You are invited to visit."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/korona/v-nemciji-konec-vseh-ukrepov-na-kitajskem-odkrili-novo-mutacijo-koronavirusa.html,"In Germany, the end of measures in China discovered a new mutation in the coronavirus","After a two-week transition period, the vast majority of measures aimed at curbing the covida-19 pandemic in the last two years have been lifted in Germany. The lifting of restrictions is provided for by federal legislation passed by the German parliament two weeks ago, and some of them can still be extended at federal state level. China, meanwhile, reports more than 13,000 new coronavirus infections, the most since the peak of the first pandemic wave more than two years ago. Healthcare professionals have discovered a possible new subtype of the omicron version in the Shanghai area that is not yet in Chinese or international databases.","Two weeks ago, both houses of the German parliament - despite opposition from the opposition and several provincial prime ministers - voted to lift the restrictions proposed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government. The new legislation came into force immediately after its approval, but the Länder were then able to use the transitional period to abolish all measures.
Today marks the end of this transitional period. At the federal level, only the use of masks on airplanes and international trains remains mandatory, and the federal states can also opt for mandatory masks in doctors' offices, nursing homes and public transport, as well as mandatory testing in medical institutions and schools. In addition, companies, shops and other institutions can decide for themselves to maintain measures such as the mandatory use of masks.
Only in two Länder, Hamburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, even stricter protection measures remain in place, on the basis of an exception allowed by federal legislation on communicable diseases. Exceptions can be made in areas where the new coronavirus is spreading the fastest and where this is also reflected in hospital overcrowding.
According to a survey by the Insa polling institute, as many as 63 percent of Germans want to continue to use protective masks in stores on a voluntary basis. Just under 30 percent said they would no longer use masks in stores.
The number of new infections in Germany remains high, but has been declining recently. A good 74,000 new cases were confirmed in the country on Saturday. About 76 percent of the population received two doses of the vaccine, and just under 59 percent opted for the third dose.
More than 13,000 new infections in China and a new subtype of omicron suspected
However, officials in the city of Suzhou west of Shanghai have detected a mutation in a version of the new coronavirus omicron that is not yet in local or international databases, Chinese media reported. ""This means that a new version of omicron has been discovered locally,"" said Zhang Joon, deputy director of the Suzhou Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to China's Xinhua news agency.
According to the National Health Commission, China recorded 13,146 new cases of new coronavirus infection today, the highest since mid-February 2020. Most cases, 11,691 asymptomatic, did not result in any deaths from covid-19.
Nearly 70 percent of new infections were recorded in Shanghai, where they are conducting mass population testing. The streets of this city remain empty today, as 25 million people continue to be severely closed.
According to the German news agency dpa, Shanghai residents can only leave home to be tested for coronavirus infection. Sports stadiums and fairs in the city have been converted into isolation centers for the infected, each with thousands of beds.
Dissatisfaction is growing in the city, as the closures are expected to last only a few days, but are now being extended, and authorities have announced new rounds of testing. Parents are worried about the threat of being separated from their children due to a positive test, and many point out limited access to food and a ban on walking dogs. Complaints about poor hygiene in isolation centers also appear on online social networks.
China’s zero-tolerance policy towards covid has been under tremendous pressure in recent weeks as the virus spreads across the country. By March, China had successfully kept the daily number of newly discovered cases at double-digit or three-digit levels with sharp localized closures, mass testing and travel restrictions. But in recent weeks, the number of new cases has risen to thousands a day.
Today, another 1.5 million people in northeastern China's Baicheng came under strict closure.
During a visit to Shanghai on Saturday, Chinese Deputy Prime Minister Sun Chunlan underlined the authorities' ""unwavering persistence"" in the current epidemiological strategy.
However, restrictive measures in Shanghai could also affect global supply chains. Maritime giant Maersk has already warned that many logistics centers in the city are closed, and road freight transport is likely to be severely affected."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/fajon_3.html,'Sexist and chauvinistic remarks do not affect me as much as they should.',"SD president Tanja Fajon, despite public opinion announcements, maintains her prime ministerial ambitions for the party she leads. According to him, they have not yet agreed with the president of the Svoboda Movement, Robert Golob, who will lead the government if they form a coalition after the elections. Although the SD announces 'No Promises' on the posters, their program is full of promises. But are these actually feasible, what would they mean for public finances? In an interview with POP TV and 24ur.com, the SD champion spoke about relations within the KUL and whether she still sees Matjaž Han at the head of their parliamentary group. confrontation on POP TV. As she says, such insults affect her less than they should.","Let’s start with post-election math: we’ve been interested in the following for a long time, but we haven’t gotten to the bottom yet. What is the agreement between the Coalition of the Constitutional Arc and Robert Golob for the mandate?
There is no concrete agreement, we only know what we are repeating, namely that the one who manages to form a sufficient majority, as the President said, will go for office. Within the democratic arc of our opposition parties, we have committed ourselves to a post-election cooperation agreement, made a good commitment and established good trust. I see the Freedom Movement as a natural ally, but political calculations or. the electorate will give the mandate to the one who will be the strongest, at least at this center-left pole, to form the future government. I want it to be us, the Social Democrats, of course, but I also want it to be able to secure at least 55 seats with the parties of the center-left bloc, so that there will certainly be a stable government for one or more terms.
In the event that the Freedom Movement wins among individual parties, and the sum of KUL will be higher - who will be the prime minister?
We are still talking about this, we still have to agree. One logic is that four parties, if we stand together for post-election cooperation, would give their prime minister in this case. It also depends a little on what the difference will be. But we have not yet had a concrete conversation with the Freedom Movement and its president. Everything is still a bit unknown, because we only met the president and the party a few weeks ago, so we will probably finish that in the coming weeks.
It seems that you will not miss out on the possibility that you will also occupy the mandate?
I think this is normal for any political party that goes to the polls. We are a big party, traditionally strong on the ground. We are definitely going to win this election. That is my ambition. We are well prepared, with a clear plan, a strong team and mostly women and young people on the lists, so we are going quite confidently. But once again - the voters will show who they will give the most confidence to.
In the last four years, the Social Democrats have joined the government of Marjan Šarc, a newcomer to state politics, which has blown up. None of this worked out in the end. Why fight with Golob?
It is true that we had some attempts, desires and ambitions because of everything that was happening to change the government prematurely or even go to the polls. We were concerned about many issues in healthcare and the epidemic, how the government addressed the rescue, how it communicated with the public, how it sanctioned protesters, passed laws that did not fall under anti-crown measures. There were many things - including extensive staffing in independent institutions, the police and the army. These attempts did not get a majority. Unfortunately, we did not get enough votes, but we managed to put together program content through this process within the opposition, we worked on the content, got to know each other and built trust, including MPs, and repeatedly suggested to the government what to do differently and better. Of course, we have not heard from each other, but we have a basis for good cooperation in advance - I think much better than this government or coalition has experienced in the past.
I asked you about Robert Golob - why would he be a good Prime Minister?
See, he will be as good as anyone else at the head of the opposition parties is likely to be. If I look at my colleagues, I think they would all be good in prime ministerial positions. Prefer someone like that if people decide, because it will be a new face again, practically every four years, our electorate tells us. I think this is another issue that people are telling us before every election that there is some distrust in politics. That there is an empty, empty space, perhaps disappointments, especially in this liberal environment, which is emptied again and again with new experiments, new projects that come - behind are some of the same forces, even people, because Slovenia is small, these are not new faces , but apparently people are telling us that there is no trust in politics - this is the key message - why they are finally deciding on something new.
This worries me because I think it is much more important to give people back their trust than politics to work for them. My sincere mission at the helm of this party is to really try to gain people's trust - with what I am, with what I want to show with ambition and, of course, with actions. That these are not some empty promises. I want us to be able to deliver on what we promise today. I think people expect this from us, not so much new faces and experiments as that politics works for people and not their own interests, which is too often a practice.
What is the party's relationship with Karl Erjavec, the former president of DeSUS, today?
We don't have any special contacts. When we meet, we greet each other as we say. He is not our member, we do not cooperate. Several times he offered to bring part of DeSUS, disappointed people, by values ​​closest to the SD party. In fact, there has been no agreement with him since then. However, it is true that some older voters joined us in local organizations - sometimes DeSUS, but now our sympathizers.
How many were there?
I find it hard to say because I don’t have some analysis, estimates. In Styria, Mr Prikl brought a large group of disappointed DeSUS voters. They also came from elsewhere, but those sympathizers who will now have to choose in the next election from parties that did not disappoint them. I am talking about the parties that are still somewhere in the government coalition today, but before the previous elections they had a different agenda, which they are implementing today. These voters are disappointed and I reckon we will get a large part of the DeSUS voters here, who were once also part of social democracy.
You talked earlier about the disappointed part of the electorate. This one seems to be mostly on the left middle pole, but not so much on the right middle. What are you doing wrong about the parties in the middle left, that this is always a disappointment, and at the same time an opportunity for new faces every time?
We don’t have to do something wrong. But we certainly have significantly more democracy, people can say what they think. On the other hand, we have a leader, now the Prime Minister, with pronounced authoritarian tendencies and tendencies, who insults and discredits people, who also misinforms, especially those who think differently. In this way, it also degrades politics and instills mistrust. We have a very deeply divided political space on the left and right. It is difficult to find any reasonable cooperation. Because it seems to me that it is precisely with these populist rhetoric, dangerous and authoritarian tendencies, including hostility, discrediting women, sexism and chauvinism, which is also present on the part of the Prime Minister, that this introduces some mistrust and anger among the people.
Perhaps this is why we are in a bigger dilemma at the center-left pole, because we have to defend ourselves more often than if we are the ones who can move forward with some ideas and ambitions. We have been in a situation several times over the last two years - we are the opposition and we did not have enough votes - but when we wanted to change health measures, work together with the profession, work with reassuring communication, we simply were not heard.
Back to the pre-election dynamics: between the KUL parties, Golob inflicted a smaller blow on you and the Left than on the SAB and LMŠ. How seriously is the existence of KUL endangered?
All four parties are sovereign parties. People love choice and rightly so. We also differ from each other in terms of programs, and we share common values. I do not see the danger of the collapse of the democratic opposition here. Probably some party will gain more or less trust. I sincerely hope that all four of us will be able to cross the parliamentary threshold, because it seems to me that this would be the best center-left government, also because we really meet weekly - at least the party presidents - we work well together. We may have had some ups and downs from the beginning, but today we know each other much better than we did a year and a half ago.
However, the atmosphere in the right part of the political space seems to be much more relaxed at the moment than on the left. Do you share such an assessment?
No. I do not understand why the atmosphere would be more relaxed at the right political pole. It seems to me that it is as tense as it always is before elections. More. I think they are working endlessly after the Prime Minister always successfully destroys his coalition allies during his term. He is frantically looking for new allies, otherwise he will be able to repeat the mistake of the previous elections that he will not be able to form a government. It is turbulent when a new party appears in the center-right pole. It seems to me that the SDS is helping to reduce its reputation very quickly, but then there is significantly more unrest or effort to find new coalition allies. If we look at the outgoing government, all coalition partners are heavily strained with the exception of perhaps the NSi, and there are still many challenges.
Former SD president Igor Lukšič recently said: 'We always have some skepticism at the center left. Recent mandates have shown that this is a very inconsistent formation and that conflicts in government are very strong, that the pressures of capital blocs on such a government are much more relentless and diverse than in the case of a right-wing government. ' How do you respond to that?
I think that there have been significantly more challenges in the liberal environment in Slovenia in recent years, that the liberal environment has probably not been able to consolidate since the time of Janez Drnovšek. We see the emergence and disappearance of customers. These are experiments, satellites, at least in recent years we have had four liberal parties, two in government, two outside government, three in the European liberal family, one outside. It is, in short, an interesting combination. If they managed to unite and create a strong liberal milieu, I think that the Freedom Movement also wanted to do that, but they did not succeed - it would be very welcome for Slovenia and the political space. So we have these projects of various emerging liberal parties that want to fill this space, but instead of filling it, they are further crushing it.
The statute of the SD party dictates that you hold an electoral congress within six months of the election. What result of the SD party in the elections could jeopardize your position as president?
Due to the local elections, we changed the statute so that we have a congress a year after the parliamentary elections, so that we have enough time so that the congress is not in the meantime. I also have to make an analysis after the parliamentary elections, whether the party managed to improve the result compared to the previous elections, what is the internal climate, how much trust I enjoy, and all this will decide after the election year what SD will do at the next congress. I think we still have a lot of time for analysis and reflection until then.
So immediately after the parliamentary elections, you are not expected to make any moves in this direction?
I would have a hard time predicting because the only scenario I have in my head is that we make a good result. So I don’t think about it. What will happen if it is, we will decide after the election.
It will soon be two years since you took over as SD president. How much did you manage to get to know the specifics of the Slovenian political parquet? Have you often been accused of lacking knowledge of domestic politics because of your Euro mission?
That's right, I was able to meet. Probably not to the same extent as those who have been working in politics in Slovenia for 10 or 20 years. I think it’s an advantage if you’re not quite a good connoisseur, if you look at things from a different, perhaps healthier distance. It can also be a disadvantage if you don’t know all the rivals, players, or guts of the connections so well. However, I might analyze it in such a way that the political situation in Slovenia is extremely bad. Our political culture is at an extremely low level. And too often I have a feeling not only that politicians are an end in themselves, but that they care far too much about their own interests, that there is a lot of ad hoc action, without long-term strategies and talks, which I greatly miss in this space.
It was a disappointment for me to work in European institutions, good knowledge of the international environment - I have been practically connected with work in Brussels for 20 years, I know some other structure of work and I must say that my initial work here in Slovenia was a disappointment. Too many times it seemed to me that this is one little sandbox of squabbling, where everyone is arguing about that space of theirs without having in mind what we want to do and really talk about it. That’s why I also understand people’s distrust because we too often give the feeling of being framed and sitting in chairs to protect our interest. I would like to change that. I would like us to talk much more in a cultural, civilized way, to agree on what we want for the people and Slovenia. I hope to be able to bring this into the space.
How hard skin did you get during that time? Do such sexist, chauvinistic remarks, which flew at the expense of your appearance after our confrontation, affect you?
I got pretty hard skin. They don’t affect me as much as they should. Because sometimes it seems that what is really unacceptable becomes acceptable. The fact that the media has been dealing with legs, insults, insults, crotches and also SDS staffing for a whole week now, not least with the content, worries me. And we are women too often, and I have been experiencing this since I have been in politics, the target of insults, sexist, chauvinistic ... For the first time, I really feel that politics in Slovenia is still a very masculine world. And I miss women and I want that female energy, so I was very insistent that we have half of the women on the candidate lists, which we practically succeeded in doing. Because it seems to me that we women have a different empathy and reassuring communication, studies also show that women leaders do well in crisis situations - not least in the health crisis. I want the men here to stand up for us. This must not become acceptable. These low blows that I follow on social media are really unacceptable. I also responded, I got a lot of support and we have to say no in the mainstream media and politics - not sexism.
You also helped women’s quotas in politics yourself when you carried out at least a seemingly agreed-upon replacement without much unrest, at least outwardly. At the time, it was understood that you wanted to make this change in order for the SD party to take the lead in the center-left. Why, as opinion polls show, why did you fail at this?
I still believe we can make it happen. Maybe I'm too optimistic by nature. But we can return to the previous debate - what is happening in the electorate in Slovenia, why distrust in politics? I see the consequences of this situation that the SD is stable and strongest within the existing opposition, but that we have a new party that takes the lead in the liberal middle, as distrust or apathy of our voters and the search for something new. But sometimes I would like to say what this new is.
How many people really wonder what this new thing brings to them? You know, we got new parties in parliament every four years, when you practically didn’t know MPs, which lowered the level of culture in parliament. We need to take all this into account, but I am aware of what people are saying - that they want role models that give them confidence, give them confidence, are determined and act outside existing policies. That way we can get confidence back.
Yet the SD was the relative winner of the 2008 election. Why do you still fail to make such a breakthrough? You are still far from that result.
Voters will decide, I believe, also based on the experience of the last week. When they decide - there is still a lot to do today, the percentage of those who are still undecided is growing again. Last week will probably be decisive when people say, ""Now I'm going to decide on this or that."" The media also plays a big role here, that is a fact. Opinion polls also influence opinion. What the interests of the media and opinion polls are, who they want to see as the winner, plays a big role.
I want us to be treated as equally as possible in the election campaign, with the same media space and coverage, so that we can really present the program, the candidates to the people. I hope so to the last. Last week, however - even in 2008 there was a similar story - a kind of funnel is created on the one who will be able to beat the other side. But this is still not a sign of a healthy democracy. Healthy Democracy is a coalition of different parties and I hope that we will be able to establish a stable coalition in the next government.
You say the media is important. So have you appeared in confrontations that are broadcast on the pro-government media?
Definitely. I am a former journalist and I may look at the media a little differently. I absolutely agree with all those who today criticize political interference in the independent media, I am also aware of the political trumpet, the propaganda structure of Nova24's ruling party and the background funding coming from neighboring Hungary. But the fact is that during the election campaign, I want people to have a chance to hear what we want to tell them. And if this space becomes limited, today we have practically half of the media in the country, which are also under some political control of the ruling coalition. And if I start deciding which media to go to, I can also stand out from the confrontations of RTV. As the political structure there also came very ideologically closer to the SDS, this can be seen in the abolition of quality broadcasts and the way they decide in pre-election confrontations. My motive is very clear - to tell people what they want to have a choice.
But there is a difference between these media. Funding flows of both. The concern is that by appearing there, you are legitimizing these media.
I will not say that this is an easy decision. Planet TV went to a joint election project with Novo24 at the last minute. In SD we do not cooperate with Novo24, we do not answer to it and we do not appear in shows. And this was a difficult dilemma, I admit that we said anyway that we are going to pre-election confrontations, especially if they are credible and provide equal treatment. We are where we are now. Whether this was the right decision, I cannot judge. It was in my interest for as many people as possible to hear us.
Who makes up your constituency? How much do you jump into cabbage with the Left Party? What do internal research say? Are these your rivals?
They are not rivals, I am quite close to the Left. As much as one part of our party - because we have a very colorful party - can also be very close to the Left. The fact is, however, that our voters can reach into the entire center-left space, from the Left to the liberal center. So we need to address everyone - all age groups, including people in urban and rural areas. We do internal research just like other political parties - I see that we can address women much more, urban centers, where we have our constituents. However, they are true either in the middle space, which is still heavily emptied, or on the left. Which means it's mutual to steal our votes.
You say urban voters - you seem to be focusing quite a bit on city centers and the urban voters you have lost the most over the years. Can reinforcements like Jonas Žnidaršič take you on the path to the old glory you were on in the 2008 elections?
It is true that in recent years, before my arrival, we SD were quite busy in urban centers. I am from Ljubljana, I don't know if this will help us because I am running in Ljubljana. It is important that we have a good result in urban centers, especially in the capital. Above all, I wanted to open the door to the party - to address people who are not traditionally party political cadres, but to open up to civil society, a non-partisan sector with which I worked a lot in the past, and to get as many new people and faces, young old and familiar faces, women, and it seems to me that one healthy mix has emerged in the end.
It is a real recipe that we address people with faces like Jonas Žnidaršič and Blaž Zgaga, who came to our list outside of politics, I don't know. But I know it is right that we have new people who, above all, want to go into politics. My guideline was when we selected the candidates that they are people who want to work in the National Assembly, that they will know what to do, because we also had trainings for the candidates that they are ready for this role if they are elected. And to be faithful to the values ​​of social democracy.
You say you want to clean up the customer. You recently told Delo: ""Many times I don't even listen to my closest colleagues, because I think we need to renovate not only the party, but also the way politics works in our country."" Who and what bothered you when you took over the leadership of the party? Who had to say goodbye? Who is new, who do you trust the most in the party?
In fact, I don’t think anyone had to say goodbye. When I came to this house, there were employees here, a team that is still there today. I brought almost none. I more or less inherited the team, but I tried to build more trust between them, to see who is capable of what, where their interests and ambitions are. New ones joined through the process. Because I am by nature a person who needs to build trust, I do not listen to the advice and recommendations of what someone is like, but I want to create this opinion myself, to follow myself. It takes some time before I manage to build trust and choose who is close to me, and this time will certainly continue to run because it is a continuation of one process.
Who is your biggest ally in the party?
I think there are more allies, I have women not male colleagues. I have managed to change the teams of professional councils a lot, which are working really well today. I would not expose anyone by name for not doing injustice, because the bench or. the line of these people is quite long.
Would you still like Matjaž Han to be the leader of the deputies?
For Matjaž Han, I am convinced that he will make an outstanding result in the elections, because he is a terribly successful and popular MP in his environment. But it will depend on the results, where it will go. There may be some other ambitions as well.
Ministerial?
We will see what the next government will be like and what the coalition negotiations will be like.
You acknowledge that the client has made mistakes in the past. What still burdens her the most today?
The party has a long tradition. I often hear it on the ground and many blame us for having the opportunity, but not taking it, for being in the government and not doing what you promised. I cannot be held accountable for the past, I have not sat in any government, but I want to influence the future. This backpack I hear about is sometimes heavy. It is much harder to manage a party with a tradition than a new party, to apologize in retrospect.
But it is also a school and a lesson for the future. I think this is very useful because you are aware of which mistakes you must not repeat and you have some knowledge and people with experience who can warn you of the dangers. I am interested in how we will work forward and I sincerely want us to make a mental leap that politics is not here for us, but that we are here for the people. This is really my wish and I hope that I will succeed with people who want to work honestly, have some high ethics and morals and are capable, they will not be here just because of some political card.
Which government position would you be most interested in?
I don’t want to calculate or talk about other people’s scenarios until we get an election result. As we go for victory, I am also ready to take on the responsibility of running the government. If we decide and are part of the government coalition and the SD has only ministerial posts, then I will decide based on the talks.
Surely the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is where to see each other?
I am certainly strong with political connections in international politics. I certainly have many friends with whom I grew up in Brussels and who are ministers today or have been ministers in different governments. These connections are sometimes underestimated in Slovenia. They are extremely important because Slovenia is small and vulnerable. Sometimes we forget this, and when some prime ministers who do not have an international background come along, we may be less heard and weaker.
Another cooperation with civil society. In the water referendum, all opposition parties seem to have had some of the cooperation with the March 8 Institute and the other initiators of the referendum. To what extent are you afraid of their criticism when or. if you are in the next government?
Criticism is always welcome and I have great respect for Nika Kovač as well as for civil society and the non-governmental sector. In recent months, I have tried to involve the non-governmental sector and civil society in all our discussions around the program and the expert councils. Now that we have worked with the Institute on the March 8 referendum on water, we have gotten to know each other well. I also collaborate and talk to Teo Jarc and Jaša Jenull and others because I am interested in how they think. Of course, they are a very critical and vocal civil society, and last but not least, I am grateful that, like the media, they are in control of what the institutions are doing. We are aware that they will remain equally critical, even when we are in government, but I hope that we will be able to use this to our advantage and that we will hear them.
On one of the posters you announce: No promises. But in reality, your program is full of promises, from free kindergartens, accessibility to a specialist in 30 days, 700 million euros to increase productivity, raising the minimum wage, free meals for all students, shorter working hours, raising the minimum pension, 10,000 new rental housing, increasing public health funding to 12% of GDP and more and more. How heavy are these promises? How realistic are they?
Without promises, it was a dedicated campaign and still holds true. My intention and the client's intention is that everything we have written in the program - more than 240 pages - is based on financial calculations, a timeline and is feasible. Why no promises? When I walked around Slovenia a lot in the last year, I mostly heard: ""We have enough promises. Everyone is just making promises. Politics is full of promises."" It is true that we promise politicians a lot and then we do not make it happen. So I set up this process of creating a program that took several months to do with the experts together and financially calculated to be feasible. At many points we had our own doubts, we talked to experts, but it is possible.
Example - 30 days to a specialist - is this possible? It is, with the right formula and agreement on how to provide more money in the public health system. One part may be the abolition of supplementary health insurance, the transfer to compulsory health insurance and the current increase in funds to the public health fund, while Slovenia is significantly below the European average. Everything that is written is not a promise. This is a program for 10 years, not for one term.
It will certainly need to be adapted to the given situation. The war in Ukraine has already happened to us, and it has made the world unpredictable and dangerous. We didn't imagine that a month ago. I immediately activated our expert groups to make an action plan, which I miss in the government. How to ensure self-sufficiency with energy and food? How to ensure the security of Slovenes and face the social challenge when even more Ukrainian refugees come to Slovenia? We worked out all this, we also had to prioritize, because the challenges due to the situation around us are different.
That is exactly what I am talking about. The situation is uncertain, and we have 40 billion in public debt. What will be the main priorities that you will not deviate from and that you definitely want to implement in this term? How much are they worth?
Regardless of the war in Ukraine, for which we do not yet know how long it will last, health care will certainly be a priority. Slovenians need quality public health. I myself have experience from 20 years ago: if I were not part of public health and did not have access to medicines and the best health care, I probably would not have overcome severe cancer.
Today I see that we have gone through a health crisis and people have not gone to a doctor or specialist, they have not made first or timely diagnoses, on the one hand there are too few family doctors, the private sector is strengthening and people have to choose whether to wait a year come to a specialist or they will pay to come next week, I see this is wrong. I want us to make the public health system with greater public financial investment, the goal is 12 percent of GDP in the public health fund, which is today's average in the EU. Above all, I want to keep the patient in mind.
214,800 people are waiting for health services in Slovenia. You promise these people they will get the service in 30 days. Is this even feasible?
You can ask the experts. I talked to many people, they all confirmed it to me. With the ambition and consent of all actors, this is feasible. And we will assure people that they will get to a specialist in 30 days.
In this term?
In this term.
How difficult is such a measure?
For the financial calculation, I should look in the papers so I won’t speak by heart. But I certainly say that funding needs to be increased. It is also a matter of reorganizing the health care system itself, which also means shortening administrative procedures so that doctors do not deal with them. It is about increasing funding to the public coffers. Certainly, one of the first steps is the abolition of supplementary health insurance, which people today pay rather non-jointly. Namely, everyone pays the same contribution regardless of income. Money is collected in insurance companies, even more so during the health crisis, instead of going to health care.
Who could solve all these problems on the government team? Who would be appointed to the post of Minister of Health?
I have decided not to talk within the party and my teams about who will sit in what chair, because I want people to prove themselves and show how committed and capable they are. If I decided in advance who would be where, I could take too many risks. However, I have a medical team led by a very capable Celjan Branko (Gabrovec op. Cit.), Who otherwise works at the NIJZ. But there are over 80 experts on this team today, so the range of potential people who can take over the health department is very large.
Don't you have a narrower one?
I have it in my head.
The health department was already headed by ministers from the SD quota, Borut Miklavčič, then Dorjan Marušič. Nothing major was done at the time to regulate this area. Why would people trust you today not to stick to promises on paper?
I find it hard to speak backwards. I think that, to be honest, no other Minister of Health has managed to make major changes, not least today, but the situation was different due to the covida-19 epidemic. I would say that we Slovenes have been quite unsuccessful in controlling the epidemic.
But I have this optimism that our medical team is very qualified and I follow their work, they have been working intensively for at least two years, they are talking, they include various expert opinions, I can't expect more than that. All I can say with certainty is that they are experts, they want to do their best, and someone has to accept responsibility in the end. Are we better now than anyone else? We are definitely better because we have a much stronger team.
You predict that you will significantly raise the salaries of nurses and medical technicians. For how much? Doctors are already warning that the relationship with last year's salary increase in nursing has collapsed. What are your plans for doctors' salaries?
Above all, I have the ambition to overhaul the single wage system in cooperation and social dialogue with all partners. What the government has done is to open Pandora’s box by excluding doctors. She forgot about other services employed in the public sector, including medical staff, technically, so there were protests.
When we talk about the reform of the single wage system, I know that this is a big deal, but it must be done together with the unions in social dialogue, that is our ambition. How will we raise wages? Certainly not in a privileged way only for certain groups. Our goal, however, is to ensure a minimum wage - at least 800 euros - and then progressively raise it.
But you probably have some idea in your head of how much nurses should be paid more.
I say that in all the negotiations so far, we have wanted to ensure that all together, as part of the public sector, are in a single wage system and not privileged. What the salary calculation will be depends on how we will adjust salaries to others in the public sector - in education, education and kindergartens.
Fidesz has long insisted on its intention to exit the public sector wage system. They say they will not back down from that.
There will be difficult negotiations. For each succeeding government, there will be a bit of work on how to reconcile different interests, but leading a social dialogue with the social partners and trade unions seems to me to be extremely important. I know this is a great challenge, but only in this way will we be able to reach some compromises that I hope everyone will be happy with.
List three concrete measures to prepare for an epidemiologically unpredictable fall in the summer.
Above all, I would listen to the profession, I would have a professional team led by qualified epidemiologists or. those who best manage the health situation. She could also be part of a government team. Then, with reassuring communication and compassion, I would like to invite people to help by respecting action. Above all, it would no longer go into ad hoc measures beyond the laws and the constitution, but through parliamentary deliberations introduce a backward rule of law when it comes to tackling the epidemic.
But you don't have a set of measures ready for the profession you are coordinating with now?
We have a very long list, we sent a set of measures to the Prime Minister throughout the health epidemic, so we also attended the first conference organized by the President, but unfortunately we were not heard. Of course, these measures are changing and adapting according to how much we know about the epidemic today and how much we knew about it two years ago. How much have we done during this time to ventilate the premises? Nothing. There is much more that could be done in schools, kindergartens and institutions if we were aware of how much ventilation means to prevent the spread of the virus. And I could go on and on.
What energy plan do you propose for next winter?
Slovenia has not been ambitious in recent years when it comes to renewables. Above all, we need to diversify our resources, which is, of course, a long-term measure if we are looking at how to provide renewable resources from either solar or wind power plants. Solar power plants could provide significantly more electricity today, but we haven’t done much. In the long run, I definitely need to put a lot of effort into renewable energy.
In the short term, what the government was trying to do - unfortunately very late also by lowering price margins and lowering VAT - was to ensure that we will be supplied with energy next winter. Prices will go up. The whole of Europe is looking for liquefied gas bypasses and supplies from third countries. Above all, we need to be very proactive here and look for solutions within the EU.
How strongly can you defend green politicians with Teš 6 on the coat of arms?
I don’t feel the burden of Teš 6, I’ve never dealt with that burden. Also in the SD, as far as I know, there is no one in any criminal proceedings regarding Teš 6. However, it is certainly true that this is a difficult issue that often burdens the party. Different teams and governments have changed, but I would like to be able to achieve the goals of closing the coal mine and rehabilitating the Šaleška Valley, for which we received European funds, and especially of a fair transition, so that people can work there and survive normally. .
These are tough challenges for the valley, there will also be tough challenges on how to provide electricity. Because today the closure of Teš 6 means that practically 40 or more percent of households in the country can lose light. These are the challenges that every government will have to address in order to ensure a clear energy and climate action plan. I don’t think any government so far has really succeeded in being ambitious enough to be self-sufficient. We Social Democrats are aware that nuclear energy will probably have to be a resource for some transitional period. However, this is such a sensitive financial and strategic issue that we will have to talk about it and agree with the people in the referendum.
You emphasize that you are strong in foreign policy and that the ties you forged in Brussels are your strength. How would you bring the arbitration story to an end?
In particular, by clearly following the decision of the arbitral tribunal or. the verdict we got. This verdict is certainly not to the liking of either side, but it is probably the most that Slovenia has been able to get and probably will not get better. I think any move that goes beyond respecting the arbitral award is very dangerous.
I am worried about what is happening in the silent diplomacy between the Prime Ministers at the moment, about negotiating a fisheries agreement, because this can mean a very dangerous deviation from the arbitration agreement and also disrespect for parliamentary procedures. Last but not least, these critical voices of Slovenian fishermen, who warn that Croatian fishermen have no place in our sea and that we are deviating from the agreements, are extremely dangerous for the state and foreign policy.
Did the war in Ukraine surprise you?
Absolutely. I think it surprised and frightened the whole world, horrifying scenes of people, bombing and warfare. Putin's severe Russian aggression is worthy of the harshest condemnation. It is difficult to watch the scenes of mothers and children fleeing, almost four million refugees are on European soil, significantly more than ever in the history of Europe, and this will be a great challenge. Ukraine is largely destroyed. A lot of solidarity and European help will be needed before life can be put back together. I hope that in a peaceful way, through dialogue, without rattling with weapons and unnecessary solo actions, even small Slovenia can be assured of peace as soon as possible.
How would you act if you were in a position of power to be able to act?
Together with all European leaders. The EU has responded very unanimously with sanctions against Putin, very unanimously also in helping Ukraine, which is not just aid in arms, but aid in the supply of medicines and food, it is humanitarian aid. Slovenia could do much more with humanitarian aid. I wonder why Slovenia did not send someone to coordinate humanitarian aid in Kiev, instead of wondering why a diplomatic mission is going there, a man from the Ministry of Defense who raises the flag one day, lowers it again the next day, then raises and lowers it again. . It seems like a rather uncoordinated action and above all I miss the Foreign Minister. Somehow he has become absent since the war in Ukraine, it seems that this is only in favor of the Prime Minister, who uses such heroic actions for political purposes.
How do you see the role of our European Commissioner in charge of crisis situations?
I want him to be more heard, to be noticed more often in Slovenia, because he is still responsible for humanitarian aid. I don’t see much of him in Brussels either, but maybe I believe because he has a lot of work to do. Maybe I could give advice to Slovenia on how to take advantage of this humanitarian dimension and help the country, but unfortunately I did not see that.
At the beginning, it seemed that Slovenia was given a rather marginal role in the European Commission with such a department, which over time, through the challenges that followed in those years, proved to be quite an important role. In your opinion, is Janez Lenarčič performing his function well?
The department he has is very important. Already during the health crisis and natural disasters and all solidarity aid, Commissioner Lenarčič played an important role. I find it hard to judge because I don’t actually hear much. Which probably means he’s not that loud, he may not be making good use of communication, but he certainly has a lot of work to do. Whether he is working successfully can be better asked by his colleagues in the European Commission. Here and there, I ask Slovenians I know if they see and hear our Commissioner, but I must say that the answers are not very encouraging.
What is the possibility of you returning to the post of MEP?
I think in my head I have long ago accepted that I am returning home. If, of course, the election happens to be extremely bad for the SD, then I will look for and have to do other things. But this moment is my desire and ambition to stay in Slovenia.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/vzpon-iliberalizma-na-periferiji-eu-v-pogojih-krize-kapitalizma.html,The rise of iliberalism on the periphery of the EU in the context of the crisis of capitalism,"It has been more than three decades since Francis Fukuyama first published a famous essay and later a book called The End of History. In the context of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the defeat of the Soviet Union in the Cold War and real socialism in Europe, followed by the third wave of democratization (Huntington), liberal democracy and capitalism seemed to have become universal. At the same time, it was explicitly assumed that democracy was possible only in liberal and capitalist societies, which also meant equating liberal democracy with democracy in general. This thesis especially focused on the union or. equating democracy with capitalism.","In the context of Europe, this thesis has seemed to hold for more than a decade. The post-socialist countries in particular, which became members of the EU in 2004 and later, all relatively quickly underwent a ""double transition"": first capitalist countries and societies, and later consolidated - at least according to very specific criteria - liberal democracies. At the same time, the introduction or. the restoration of capitalism took place with the neoliberal “shock doctrine” promoted by Jeffrey Sachs at the time throughout Eastern and Central Europe. Slovenia has long been an exception among the remaining countries that joined the EU in 2004, but this has also gradually changed with the approach to the EU. The post-socialist EU member states became the new periphery of the EU, as they ensured the expansion of the single market, provided a competitive advantage for companies from the central EU and, above all, offered a pool of cheaper or. cheap labor, which was in the interest of capital from Central European countries. The key was that the ""European future"" took care that post-socialist societies did not ""deviate"" from the path of capitalism.
The crisis of 2008 changed many things in the capitalist world system - in the EU and also on its new periphery. First, the European project suffered a severe blow and the idea that all countries in the EU are equal and equal failed as it became clear that the EU was acting in the interests of the strongest members and financial capital in crisis situations. Second, the peripheries have often been forced to save and tighten their belts, as prescribed by the EU institutions together with the IMF and the World Bank. This was most often seen as a reduction in the size of the welfare state (similar processes took place in the core EU countries, but less radically). Thirdly, at the global level, in a situation where the possibility of significant economic changes in the direction of limiting the power of markets and various fractions of capital has emerged, these have been absent. Liberal elites have offered even more at EU level, as elsewhere, to resolve the crisis and crisis period.
Liberal politicians in the EU have failed to find any new answers to the growing contradictions of world capitalist society in the 21st century. In this context, the ""left"" or. the Liberals and the rest of the Social Democrats remained in opposition to market restrictions. There was no left-wing response - except for some attempts that were suppressed in the mud. The lack of ideas and the reproduction of the status quo have thus given way to right-wing or liberal politicians.
In this context, growing uncertainty, austerity, unequal treatment of countries and growing inequalities in individual countries are strengths in post-socialist countries - as well as elsewhere in Europe and the world, but the reasons are slightly different from those explained here - in the first indeed, the global crisis of capitalism from the defeat of realsocialism began to gain mainly right-wing or liberal political forces, which had very ""convenient"" answers to the crisis of capitalism - all blamed on foreigners, migrants, elites, etc. However, they themselves have presented themselves and still present themselves as the best, uncorrupt and honest politicians who advocate a stronger nation-state and protectionism in capitalism.
Iliberal policy on the EU's post-socialist periphery is based on xenophobic, sexist and (often) racist policies, together with the protection and / or emergence of new capital elites in their own countries and the reproduction of their own dominance in the face of a global neoliberal project. To the crisis of the EU, the crisis of neoliberal globalization and the growing inequality - especially wealth, which is a global phenomenon - and the subordinate position of an individual state in relation to the central states of the EU, illiberal policy offers even more, but with a different vocabulary. The Iliberal Right on the periphery of the EU is successfully channeling discontent and creating apparent certainty, while at the same time essentially caring for the reproduction of capitalism and the market, but with a different, less politically correct appearance.
Iliberal politicians on the periphery of the EU are gaining strength due to people's dissatisfaction and real existential problems, but this is a specific response to undemocratic liberalism or technocratic rule imposed by supranational institutions on the periphery of Europe due to the need to reproduce dependent capitalism. But liberals trapped in neoliberal globalization discourse cannot understand, much less resolve, the contradictions that generate the rise of illiberal politics, because their policies and actions in the historical defeat of the left create the right conditions to increase the power and attractiveness of the illiberal right. Both the emergence of right-wing illiberal politics and the struggle of liberals against it symbolize the ""end of economic history"" - both liberal and illiberal politics swear by the market and capitalism, the only difference being a modality adapted to the particular interests and position of the state or elite in the capitalist world system."

But after two years of epidemics, healthcare is only getting more exhausted and even harder to access. Even before the epidemic, the long queues for various specialist examinations and treatments were even longer, with more than 130,000 people even without a personal doctor. Doctors from health centers go to private individuals or elsewhere - where salaries are higher and the workload is lower. More and more young doctors are also considering leaving.","We are people behind the numbers of Slovenian healthcare. On the one hand, there is a great shortage of doctors, which reaches the number of 1000, on the other hand, those who do not have a personal doctor or have limited access to him. There are 130,000 individuals.
The biggest deficit is among family doctors, which is the basis of health care. For several years now, the chamber has also noted: ""There are fewer applications for some other professions, which are mostly related to the hospital environment and belong to the so-called difficult, demanding medicine, to cite the example of intensive care, hematology, some surgical professions,"" said the president. Chamber Bojana Beović.
And how would a system that urgently needs solutions change political parties? Among other things, NSi envisages the abolition of concessions and the introduction of an independent healthcare provider. The Connect Slovenia movement states that public health care must mean the right to fast and efficient health care. The SDS intends to improve the quality of services, increase accessibility and ensure the competitiveness of Slovenian medicine. In the Svoboda movement, they are in favor of eliminating amphibians, and they would establish competition for the provision of health services until the queues decrease. The SD would stimulate additional work in a public health institution and the responsibility of health management. Even with the Left, we would abolish t. i. amphibians and strengthen public health with additional resources. The LMŠ would increase the attractiveness of the profession of family doctor by providing better working conditions. In the SAB, they increased the number of family doctors and improved working conditions.
This time, however, as medical associations note: ""We are a hatchery for rich countries,"" and added, ""the health system will be successful in meeting the challenges of patient care only when we strengthen our staff to meet regular programs.""
The epidemic has exacerbated the problems of our health care that have been accumulating for years. In the show 24UR ZVEČER, the family doctor dr. Rok Ravnikar and dr. Luka Kovač from the Young Doctors Association.
'Greater employment flexibility needed'
Is the NSi proposal on independent health care providers a good solution? Will there be more family doctors because of this? ""The situation is so serious that the solution cannot be separated on the left or right, because in a sinking boat it doesn't matter which way you throw water from the boat. Flexibility of employment at the appropriate level is one of the things that have been identified as problematic in In other words, if young doctors had more forms of employment and cooperation, even in the most desirable direction, such as the profession of freelance doctor, this would undoubtedly attract a few more young doctors to the primary level than before, ""Ravnikar said.
We are all aware that healthcare is one of the foundations of our society. The 14 ministers who have changed in the last 14 years certainly do not contribute to the implementation of effective solutions in the field of health, Kovač added. ""I agree with Dr. Ravnikar's opinion that we need something different, especially flexibility, especially in the field of primary health care, because young people who grew up in a slightly different system and need different forms of labor law are entering the labor market or medicine itself."" He added that the 'free doctor' was not invented by them, but that it was a work organization similar to most EU countries.
'If we want to keep young doctors, we need to take decisive and swift steps'
He pointed out that poor salaries, which the SAB points out, are not limited to family doctors. ""All doctors enter the profession on equal terms. Young doctors, ie specialists, we are young specialists, we could say, poorly paid. six years, his base salary is nine euros net per hour. ""
Ravnikar remarked that poor salaries are also indirectly one of the reasons why so few young people opt for family medicine. ""This is one of the more important aspects, although the salary of family doctors is never the first choice for choosing a specialization. However, this is one of the measures available to the state to try to influence young people's choices. If we want doctors to stay Regardless of specialization, this is an area that will need to be regulated. We are in contact with neighboring EU countries where wage relations are clear. Young people have a free path and will go there. If we want to keep them for our patients, we will some concrete, decisive and swift steps need to be taken. ""
'The key problem is working conditions'
Kovač reiterated that the Young Doctors agree with the Fidesz union and demand an exit from the single wage system. ""Because Fidesz has recognized that this form is unacceptable for doctors in the current structure. It does not allow enough flexible remuneration, enough financial incentives for all or most young people to decide to stay in this system. And as we have shown in In our analysis of the case of Germany and the United Kingdom, the salaries of doctors in Slovenia are at least 20 to 30 percent too low, even if we take into account the GDP of Germany and the United Kingdom. ""
But how to encourage young people to opt for family medicine in greater numbers? Is it enough to just advertise more specializations and hope for the best? Of course not, Ravnikar answers, as the Medical Chamber and the Ministry have regularly advertised more places for family medicine for the last 10 years than was of interest. ""In the last 10 years, almost 600 vacancies for specialization in family medicine have remained unfilled. That is, there is no problem in tendering or restricting access to family medicine. The key problem is working conditions: overburdening and oversaturation with non-professional administrative and bureaucratic burdens. ""We are doing work that should be done by ZZZS representatives. These are not things that have made us study medicine."" He also noted that family doctors are often less valued among colleagues.
The flexibility of remuneration is greater for private individuals, should this be ensured in public institutions as well? Efficiency is certainly one of the important characteristics that every organization must follow, but in healthcare, which is somewhat specific here, quality and ensuring safe care for patients must come first, Kovač emphasized. ""At the same time, we will ensure safe and quality care by following the European directive of the 48-hour working day. This is one of the things that young doctors are increasingly emphasizing - to ensure that we limit working hours in the field of healthcare.""
'After who will be the Minister of Health, we will know how seriously the government is thinking'
How should our health care system be improved, what should be the first step of the new government, whatever it is? Kovač stated that according to the data of the Medical Chamber, between 2010 and 2020 he left Slovenia or about a thousand doctors did not continue their careers in medicine - some 500 graduates and another 400 doctors. This is about as many doctors as are needed to reach the European average. ""What we see as the fundamental measure we expect from the next government is, above all, stability. We need a stable minister and some clear goal that the governing policy should pursue.""
Ravnikar added that experience shows that it is not so much what the parties write in the programs, but who they will appoint as a minister. ""The fact that they were replaced 20 in 20 years means that no political group has ever risked a strong political figure in the Ministry of Health, so the content has never been faced with some solutions to such a complex system as health care. an important president of the coalition party of the future government has decided to be the Minister of Health, we will know that the next government is serious.

According to some unofficial information, the common fishing area is rather limited, and the same number of Slovenian and Croatian fishermen could enter it. Minister of Agriculture Jože Podgoršek still insists that he knows nothing about the common fishing zone, but says that he is already talking to local fishermen about what such an area would mean for them.","Even today, Minister of Agriculture Jože Podgoršek insists that he knows nothing about the agreement on the joint fishing zone: ""I must generically deny any information here. We have no information, we do not participate in these talks and therefore these questions will probably be answered for foreign affairs. ""
The Croats obviously used completely different tactics. A month ago, their ministers of foreign affairs and agriculture attended a meeting with Istrian fishermen, where, given the reactions of fishermen, they apparently also talked about establishing a common fishing zone. ""Slovenians are punishing us, but we are offering them the sea so that we can fish, so that they can withdraw our fines,"" said Danijel Kolec, a fisherman from Umag. ""I find it difficult to comment on how Croats communicate this. We are in constant contact with Slovenian fishermen and we are also discussing what such behavior might mean,"" Podgoršek added.
According to our unofficial information, the policy is not to consider the establishment of a general fishing zone, but to release only the same, limited number of Slovenian and Croatian fishermen into the disputed area. ""This is an acceptable idea for fishermen, especially in the Piran Bay."" This is acceptable for fishermen, especially in the Savudrija region.
Aleš Boljle, head of the fisheries office, answered the question whether this piece of sea that we Slovenes have is big enough to accommodate the Croatian fishing fleet: ""No, of course not, and in any case it would be necessary to take into account professional arguments and the factual situation of Slovenian commercial fishing, which, as said, is limited. "" He is convinced that any decisions should be made on the basis of the delimitation determined by the arbitration."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/osmi-marec.html,Institute March 8: The authorities sent an inspectorate over us,"The March 8 institute, which is calling for signatures in support of their bill against harmful government action, said it had received a call from the inspectorate for clarification about the campaign. The misdemeanor authority began collecting explanations and evidence of their alleged violations of electoral law. As they commented on the call on March 8, everything that was publicly announced two days ago has happened, namely that the authorities will not choose the means to discredit.","According to the call for explanations, the Inspectorate of the Republic of Slovenia for Internal Affairs has recently received several anonymous reports against the Institute on 8 March in connection with alleged violations of electoral legislation. As they also wrote, they also received press questions regarding the activities they are carrying out during the election campaign. They were asked to comment on whether they are conducting an election campaign and who is the person responsible for conducting the campaign.
In March 8, they wrote in response that the authority over the Institute sent an inspectorate on March 8: ""Unfortunately, everything that we publicly announced at the Institute on March 8 two days ago that the government will not choose means to discredit."" they used discredits and lied about the content of the law against harmful measures of the authorities and scared people that we would take their aid and allowances. Everyone can see each of the changes with their own eyes and see that the law only reduces the impact of politics on education, justice and the police, and restores equality and the rule of law. whatever the legal basis, they also send an inspectorate under the auspices of the Ministry of Public Administration. Personal discrediting, media attacks and attacks by institutions are authoritarian tactics of the authorities that want to intimidate, silence. ""
As they add, ""it is clear to the authorities that the campaign to propose a law with the certified signatures of citizens and spread the word about it among the people is our fundamental legal and constitutional right. Any denial of this right is undemocratic, and preventing our right it was a crime. ""
As they added, SDS MP Alenka Jeraj even told them a few days ago that if we want to change the laws, we should establish a party. This statement shows everything that is wrong with the current government's policy. About laws and how our country should develop society, only the parties can decide, and the people should be simply silent. This is a partycracy that is contrary to the democratic foundations of our constitution. Contrary to the constitutional provisions of popular power (Article 3), the right to proposing laws. Democratic politics must work with and for the people. ""
They do not know what they are accused of in the anonymity: ""We know, however, that there can be nothing relevant in them, as we are merely exercising our constitutional right. We will respond to the letter within the time limit set for us.""
Nika Kovač, director of the Institute on March 8, emphasizes: ""At the Institute on March 8, we are clinging to the community. A wonderful, courageous and solidary community that was established during the referendum on clean drinking water. A community that was established during the campaign ""Let's go to the polls"". democracy. ""
Recall: March 8 with a law against government action and calls for elections
On March 8, the Institute called for a signature in support of a bill against harmful measures taken by the authorities. They are convinced that the bill drafted by the Institute on March 8 in recent months will ""eliminate in one fell swoop many of the harmful legislative changes adopted during this parliamentary term"".
As they wrote, they want the law to return the power of employee representatives to school and kindergarten councils and reduce the impact of politics on schools, the appointment of principals and the upbringing and education of children. They want to return the status to nature conservation organizations. However, they want to take away from the Minister of Culture the possibility of arbitrary decisions on the allocation of public funds and return power to the expert commissions.
They want to prevent the political replacement of 126 leading employees in the Police, prevent the Minister of the Interior from interfering in the conduct of the Police in pre-trial proceedings and restore the independence of state prosecutors. They would deny the Ministry of the Interior direct access to data relating to the work of the Police, return full autonomy to the National Investigation Office and re-establish arms regulation. They want to disable the privileges of political officials in the crimes of threat and coercion.
They want to eliminate the ""lobbying Uber law"", which, in their opinion, further reduces the rights of workers and increases the possibility of exploiting taxi drivers. They want to return the importance of the architectural profession in project management. They want to return 2.6 million euros to the budget, which were lost due to tax gifts for business gifts, business lunches and parties. They also want to eliminate the condition of 5,000 euros in the account for foreign students.
As announced, they will travel to various places and organize local campaigns during the weekend to collect signatures within the Let's Go to the Elections movement. ""We will do campaigns and distribute leaflets all over Slovenia.""
The coalition estimates that this is an election campaign
The coalition parties SDS, NSi and Konkretno estimate that there is no need to lift government measures, as they were not harmful. They believe that the Institute is running an election campaign on March 8 by collecting signatures under a bill to reduce inequality and harmful policy interference. People are urging people to “go crazy” as suggested by the institute.
Opposition parties LMŠ, SD, Levica and SAB support the bill to reduce inequality and harmful policy interventions, as proposed by the Institute on March 8.
The deadline for collecting voters' signatures in support of the bill to reduce inequality and harmful policy interventions, as proposed by the Institute on March 8, has already begun. They also liaised with a number of civil society organizations to help collect signatures. Signatures were also submitted by KUL parties."

In the part of the opposition, however, they were critical of the lack of social dialogue. Explicit opposition to the proposals, which will be decided by the National Assembly on Wednesday or Thursday next week as part of the voting, was expressed only in the Left.","NSi wants to follow the European directive on the reconciliation of private and professional life by proposing an amendment to the Parental Protection and Family Benefits Act. According to the proposal, the father will use 15 calendar days of paternity leave from the child's birth to his third month of age. The remaining 15 days, which according to the current legislation can be spent until the child has finished the first grade of primary school, will become part of the parental leave in the part that is not transferable.
In line with the requirements of the directive that 60 days of parental leave should not be transferred between parents, the proposal amends the legal part regarding the agreement on division between parents by allowing each of them at least 60 days of non-transferable parental leave. If the father transfers 100 days of parental leave to the mother, he is left with 60 days, which are non-transferable.
The same applies in the case of transfer of all 100 days from mother to father. Thus, the father can take 260 days of parental leave, leaving the mother with 60 non-transferable days.
Due to the requirements of the directive, the duration of the right to part-time work due to parenthood is extended until the child is eight years old, while the current limit is until the end of the child's first grade of primary school. Both parents will also be able to work part-time due to parenthood, but the total use of the right will not exceed 20 hours per week.
Changes in the area of ​​child allowance
The proposal introduces automatism in the allocation of child allowance in material form. The allowance will be paid to one of the parents in kind for three months if the school inspectorate ex officio informs the competent center for social work about the initiation of misdemeanor proceedings against the parents of a student who does not go to school for unjustified reasons.
According to the current legislation, this is not an automatism, but the center must carry out the identification procedure in each case.
Last but not least, the proposal provides for a reduction of the child allowance by one third if the child does not continue his / her education in secondary school after primary school. With this solution, the proponents want to encourage children to achieve a higher level of education than primary school.
In the presentation of the positions of the parliamentary groups, the coalition's parliamentary groups emphasized the advantages of the proposal, which, according to their assurances, is more family-friendly and enables better reconciliation of work and private life. In addition, it was prepared in the hope that all children would complete primary school and continue their education in secondary school. Coalitions were also attached to DeSUS.
Meanwhile, the SD and SAB had several concerns, most notably in the Left, where they insist that family policy must be part of social policy and thus, in particular, eradicate poverty and deprivation of children in society. According to them, the proposal does the exact opposite, namely it deepens social inequalities and pushes poor and marginalized families even further to the margins of society.
They will not oppose the SD proposal, but they see it as an ill-considered solution. Among these, for example, is the proposed automatism in the allocation of child allowance in material form if the child does not go to school. According to the SD, the legislative and legal service of the National Assembly and the advocate of the principle of equality also pointed this out.
SAB is also skeptical about this solution. According to them, children should be encouraged, not punished. In addition, the proposal discriminates against children, they stressed.
The proposal for an amendment to the Social Welfare Benefits Act, which was also submitted to the parliamentary procedure by the NSi and was the next in line at the extraordinary session of the National Assembly, is also related to the above-mentioned proposal. It brings a fairer distribution of public funds and greater social security of the individual and his comprehensive treatment, they are convinced in NSi.
With the changes, they want to ensure that those who really need cash receive social assistance. In the event of distress or social endangerment, they want to help the individual to be able to train and be able to ensure a dignified survival for himself and his family members.
They were also the most critical of the Left in this proposal. Child benefit is reduced for the poorest children, who are not guilty of anything, they pointed out."

The institute submitted the first 840 signatures to the Ljubljana administrative unit. ""We aim to collect significantly more than 5,000 signatures,"" said Mojca Lukan, a representative of the institute. Meanwhile, the opposition parties LMŠ, SD, Levica and SAB announced that they support the bill to reduce inequality and harmful policy interventions.","
""We have been preparing for a long time for citizens to be able to sign at administrative units across Slovenia from today onwards, demanding the abolition of some of the most controversial legal changes under this government,"" he said at a press conference organized by the Institute 8. March, said Kristina Krajnc, a member of the program committee.
In recent months, the Institute has drafted a law requiring non-political education, independence of state prosecutors, operational independence of the police and the National Investigation Office, preventing Uber from entering Slovenia, limiting the Minister of Culture's arbitrariness in granting public funds and eliminating many other changes that increase the influence of politics while completely ignoring the profession and many calls from the public. ""We are signing for taxi drivers, architects, foreign students, the independence of public prosecutors, police officers, non-political education, nature conservation organizations, fairer taxation and the removal of some of the worst legislative changes to this mandate. they will help us collect signatures, ""Krajnčeva said, adding that they would like to build a broad network of support for the bill across the country.
During the collection of certified signatures, they will therefore travel to various places in Slovenia on weekends as part of the Gremo volit movement and organize local campaigns there. Maja Koražija, a member of the program committee of the Institute on March 8, said that in the last two months ""a wonderful, combative and determined community of people has been rebuilt"" and that they are very happy that the collection of signatures has finally started and can finally be let's go to the streets of towns and villages - where we really feel best "".
Already today, in Postojna, Ljubljana, Litija, Trbovlje, Radovljica, Ptuj and Slovenj Gradec, they will go to the Administrative Units and sign, Koražija announced. They will also set up collection points - mailboxes, where people will be able to submit their certified signature. The list of collection points and all other information will be published on the Gremo volit website (March 8). They will do campaigns and distribute leaflets all over Slovenia. ""Last weekend we took a bus to Zasavje, Posavje and SE Slovenia. There are three more weekend trips ahead of us. We will visit all regions,"" said a representative of the institute.
The signature of support for the bill can be verified and submitted in two different ways. Mojca Lukan explained in person, at any administrative unit in Slovenia, without ordering or online via e-Government, which can be done by those who have a qualified digital certificate or smsPASS. At least 5,000 verified signatures are needed for the bill to be considered in the National Assembly, but the Institute decided on March 8 to collect many more, thus showing that such legislative practices are not in the interests of the people, who therefore strongly reject them. . ""We want to show how big our community is, which will always oppose unjust legal changes and fight for a fairer society,"" Lukanova said.
While collecting signatures, people are also urged to take part in the elections. ""We are also doing this because the decision on whether or not this bill will be adopted will be decided by the deputies who will sit in the National Assembly after April 24,"" a representative of the Institute concluded on March 8.
""We want to eliminate some of the worst legislative changes that have been made during this government's term.""
The institute explained on March 8 that it wanted to remove the measures taken by the authorities, which were largely taken quickly and without taking into account the opinion of experts, but increased inequality and political influence and destroyed the rule of law. ""We called on people to send us their proposals, merge them with ours and prepare their own bill, which aims to eliminate some of the worst legal changes adopted during the mandate of this government,"" said Nika Kovac, director of the institute.
They want to eliminate the changes that have been made in various areas, including the composition of the councils of educational institutions, staffing in the police, exclusion of NGOs dealing with the environment from environmental procedures, providing a legal basis for Uber, increased influence decisions of the Minister of Culture in the field of cultural program and project tenders and interference with the independence of state prosecutors. On March 8, volunteers from the Institute will collect signatures in front of numerous administrative units throughout Slovenia, announced Kovač. ""Organizing a campaign is often exhausting, we often have a feeling that things are going too slowly. We need you to join us. We need you to prove to each other together that we are not alone,"" she wrote.
On the institute's Facebook page, those interested were invited, among other things, to invite friends and family in addition to submitting their signatures, and to receive at least five signatures.
Part of the opposition supports the Institute's bill on March 8
In a statement after the submission of the signature for the submission of the proposal, SD President Tanja Fajon emphasized that with this step they are drawing attention to everything that the government has done harmful during this term. She is also convinced that, following the water referendum, a crucial moment has now come for citizens to draw attention to irregularities by supporting civil society.
Regarding possible reservations, because they will interfere with a large number of laws in one fell swoop, which the opposition has been critical of in the past, Fajonova replies that they will also comment after the proposal is submitted to the parliamentary procedure. According to Fajon, the new coalition will most likely decide on the bill, as the parties to the new coalition will agree on the priority changes. ""It's about restoring the rule of law and eliminating inequalities,"" she said.
Jani Möderndorfer (LMŠ), while contributing to the signature, assessed that it is an indisputable fact that the current government is leaving, but it has done a lot of damage. According to him, the campaign to collect signatures is proof that the KUL party, the Freedom Movement and the non-governmental sector together are doing what the current government has failed to do. However, he added that the changes would not take effect overnight and under an urgent procedure, as was the practice of the government, but in agreement with non-governmental organizations and people.
Left MP Miha Kordiš said that the third Janša government had done so much damage in the two years of its mandate that it could not be listed and included in a single law. ""What is possible, however, has been translated into this law against the harmful measures of the Janša government, which we in the Left support,"" he added. At the same time, he pointed out that everything depends on the next convocation of the National Assembly, noting that not all such measures are within the competence of the National Assembly. “Led by highly controversial police staffing along repressive verticals,” he added.
The SAB party supports this law in most points, said SAB Secretary General Jernej Pavlič. At the same time, they support all efforts to change and restore the things that the government has focused on undermining the rule of law, free media ""and some other measures that actually worsen the status of the state"", he added. He reminded that the opposition had exhausted all the democratic means at its disposal during this term, but ""of course, if you don't have a majority, you can't stop these things, so it's right that we follow the legal path"".
The coalition sees an election campaign in the Institute's moves on March 8th
The coalition parties SDS, NSi and Konkretno estimate that there is no need to lift government measures, as they were not harmful. They believe that the Institute is running an election campaign on March 8 by collecting signatures under a bill to reduce inequality and harmful policy interference. People are urging me to “go crazy” as suggested by the institute.
The SDS estimates that the measures taken within the anti-crown packages have brought a lot of good for the citizens, but at the same time they are wondering whether the institute will propose to deprive people of the aid intended for them. SDS MP Alenka Jeraj believes that the Institute's conduct on March 8 is reminiscent of the election campaign, although the Institute is not a political party and did not register for the election campaign. ""This would, of course, keep us under scrutiny as to where the source of the money earmarked for these campaigns and the spending of this money came from,"" Jeraj said. She also noted that laws are passed in parliament. ""If the Institute wants to pass laws on March 8, it should register as a political party, go to the polls and have scissors and a canvas in their hands,"" she added.
NSi Vice President and Minister of Labor Janez Cigler Kralj described the Institute's bill ""as a step back in history and in injustice, non-solidarity and lack of freedom"". At the same time, he listed the government's successes, from helping companies, free public transport for retirees, to higher net wages. ""And if the Institute collects signatures on March 8 against such solutions, proposals of Nova Slovenija or, more broadly, government teams, I believe that they have no contact with citizens,"" said Cigler Kralj. At the same time, he expressed hope that their initiatives will not succeed and called for ""resistance to such madness as is now proposed by the Institute on March 8"".
The party Konkretno responded only on Twitter, with the party's president and economy minister Zdravko Počivalšek sharing the Institute's signature on collecting signatures that they did not follow the rules of the National Electoral Commission (DVK) and the Court of Audit. At the same time, he asked the Institute whether Slovenes would return the money for vouchers and aid that the state granted to the self-employed, companies, pensioners, students and farmers within the framework of anti-crown packages. Regarding the support for the bill, which will be decided by the next composition of the National Assembly, Jeraj said that we will see who will have the majority, and that the Institute must first collect 5,000 signatures to submit the law. Cigler King, however, said that ""whoever cares at least a little about what people want and for their good will not be able to support the Institute's March 8 proposals.""
At the Institute on March 8, they are convinced that the bill they have drafted in recent months will ""eliminate in one fell swoop many of the harmful legislative changes adopted during this parliamentary term"". According to them, the bill requires ""non-political education, independence of state prosecutors, operational independence of the police and the National Investigation Office, prevents Uber from entering Slovenia and limits the arbitrariness of the Minister of Culture in granting public funds."""

We also follow the confrontations on 24ur.com and we will collect everything related to them here.","1. CONFRONTATION
At the first pre-election confrontation on POP TV, the guests spoke about the war in Ukraine, the food and energy crisis, the epidemic, about what to expect after the election. Robert Golob, who has not yet managed to confront Janez Janša, does not believe that this is a coincidence and hopes that this will happen soon.
Luka Mesca is annoyed that politics has become such a theater: ""We're watching a reality show."" Tanja Fajon was harsh that the current government had taken away people's dignity, and Matej Tonin reassured that there was no room for resentment in politics. Aleš Hojs defended the deleted tweet about refugees. Alenka Bratušek pointed out that Slovenia is historically indebted. Marjan Šarec announces the normalization of the situation, and Zdravko Počivalšek announces cooperation with everyone.
The Facts team analyzed the credibility of the statements after the confrontation. Several statements are not true about the country's public debt, the country's health successes in the face of an apparent crisis, and the price of electricity before and after the departure of Robert Golob from the Gen-I summit.
2. CONFRONTATION
At the second pre-election confrontation on POP TV, our guests spoke about the outcome of the elections in Hungary and Serbia, about resolving the energy crisis, housing issues, political communication and post-election cooperation.
The confrontation was marked by sharp word exchanges. Jernej Vrtovec promised that no one would be cold next winter, and Robert Golob warned that the consequences of the crisis would be borne by industry. Tanja Fajon estimated that energy vouchers are just 'late firefighting', while Marjan Šarec pointed out the problem of reducing network charges.
Romana Tomc promised the young people that the state would help them take out loans, while Alenka Bratušek would limit market rents. Alojz Kovšca emphasized the need to cooperate with everyone, and according to Luka Mesca, the Left will ensure that the coalition agreement is not a dead letter.
Once again, the Facts team checked live the statements of eight party representatives who, according to the two most recent Mediana opinion polls, show them the best for our media house.
After the confrontation, however, they selected a few more statements, which they further checked."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/nsi_2.html,NSi,"Nova Slovenija was founded on August 4, 2000, a few months after the Slovene People's Party and the Slovene Christian Democrats joined forces after many years of efforts. The party experienced one major upheaval in 2008 when it dropped out of parliament in the parliamentary elections, but then managed to return to parliament in December 2011. The current president of the party is Matej Tonin. They are running in the elections with the slogan Determined Forward.","The party has participated in the government of Janez Janša for the last two years. Matej Tonin is Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Jernej Vrtovec Minister of Infrastructure, Janez Cigler Kralj Minister of Labor, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Mark Boris Andrijanič Minister of Digital Transformation, dr. Jože Podgoršek is the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Food.
The president of the party Tonin spoke for our portal in an extensive pre-election interview.
He also answered 10 quick questions that try to take a politician's view of some key political and social areas.

NSi ensures that they are a party with clear values. The government's program for the future is divided into fourteen areas, which, according to them, provide clear answers to the challenges of the future: ""We are convinced that everyone needs freedom to fully develop their talents. a stable environment. ""
In the introduction to the ""Government Program 2022-2026"", they emphasize that they recognize digitalisation as a key challenge, they are committed to nature conservation, and the green transition must be carried out ""responsibly and wisely"". Stable energy supply at affordable prices will separate successful countries from less successful ones, they estimate and emphasize that self-sufficiency with quality food for Slovenian farmers is becoming increasingly important. They promise quality infrastructure: ""A modern road and railway network will be the backbone of Slovenia's future development.""
They ensure that they do not forget the weak and vulnerable: ""Regulated long-term care, decent wages and pensions are building blocks of a prosperous state. At the same time, we need more social justice. The justice system must give people a sense of the rule of law. cheating. ""
They focus on security challenges, according to them ""the modern and equipped Slovenian Army is the guarantor of our sovereignty"".

Several statements are not true, both regarding the country's public debt, the country's health successes in the face of the apparent crisis and the price of electricity before and after the departure of Robert Golob from the Gen-I summit.","The Facts team checked the statements of the party champions live, and after the confrontation, we selected a few more statements that we further checked.
The president of Konkretno Zdravko Počivalšek said that in the covida-19 epidemic we were ""on average as successful in the field of health as other state member states"".
Počivalšek did not explain what specifically places Slovenia on average in the health field at the time of covida-19. However, the fact is that Slovenia ranks among the EU countries among those with lower vaccination against covid-19 and higher mortality, so according to these two criteria it does not rank among the average performance in the EU.
According to ECDC data released on 24 March, 75.2% of the population in the EU has been vaccinated with one dose, 72.4% with full vaccination and 52.3% with the booster dose. In Slovenia, 57.9 percent of the population is fully vaccinated, and 60 percent with one dose. Among the 27 EU countries, Slovenia ranks 23rd in terms of the share of fully vaccinated population, followed by only four countries, namely Croatia, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia.
According to the Worldometers data published on 24 March, Slovenia ranks eighth among EU countries in terms of mortality of patients with covid-19. Only three countries with a higher vaccination coverage have higher mortality rates: Lithuania, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Among the countries with a higher level of vaccination than Slovenia, there are 19 that have a lower mortality rate.
Zdravko Počivalšek, Alenka Bratušek and Aleš Hojs on borrowing
In the pre-election confrontation, Počivalšek said that Slovenia was now less indebted than in the government of Alenka Bratušek. ""When we took office, we had an 82 percent share of debt in GDP, today we have 74 percent.""
The statement is not true. Počivalšek began his ministerial career during the government of Miro Cerar. Her term began in early September 2014, succeeding the Bratušek government. According to the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS), the consolidated government debt amounted to 77.2 percent of GDP at the end of the third quarter of 2014, and 80.3 percent at the end of the last quarter of the same year. The government of Janez Janša took office on 13 March 2020. At the end of the first quarter of 2020, the country's public debt amounted to 68.8 percent of GDP. The latest official figures refer to the end of the third quarter of last year, when government debt was 79.6%. The Ministry of Finance estimates that the debt amounted to 74.9 percent of GDP in 2021, but the final data from SORS will be published on 31 March.
Počivalšek says that Slovenia's GDP is more than 50 billion euros. The statement holds. GDP in current prices amounted to 52 billion euros last year, according to SORS data.
Minister of the Interior Aleš Hojs stated that Slovenia's indebtedness was highest when the government was led by Alenka Bratušek. Bratušek led the government from March 20, 2013 to September 18, 2014. During this time, according to SORS, public debt grew, amounting to 28.9 billion euros at the end of the third quarter of 2014. Relatively, public debt was the highest at the end of the second quarter of 2014, at 77.7 percent of GDP.
However, this is neither the absolute nor the relative highest indebtedness of the state so far. The highest debt in the share of GDP was at the end of the first quarter of last year (85 percent of GDP), at that time it was also the highest absolute debt (40.149 billion euros). That is why Hoys' statement is not true.
Bratuškova replied that ""the highest interest rate ever in our country was reached by the second Janša government"".
The statement holds. Janša led the government for the second time between 10 February 2012 and 20 March 2013, when, according to the Ministry of Finance, the government borrowed at a rate of 5.35%, which is the highest ever.
Pigeon on staff turnover
When asked by co-leader of the confrontation Edi Pucer what and how he would change, considering that he said that the ruling politics is not right-wing, but fascism, and announced a personnel purge, he answered that he never said that.
That statement is not true. Namely, on 16 December, Golob stated at a public tribune in Kino Šiška that this was not right-wing politics, but fascism. ""And I think it's time to say that's enough, and to drive them away, away from our governing bodies.""
On March 19 this year, in an interview for the Saturday supplement of the Delo newspaper, he answered the question of journalist Suzana Kos as follows:
""It is estimated that you will mercilessly cut down Janša's staff, where first? In SDH, BAMC?"" Robert Golob: ""Don't you think that changes are needed in other areas as well? In culture, police, media? If we deal with where one can change individually, we will not get anywhere. I support the civil society's proposal that The issue of Janša's government's harmful moves must be resolved systematically and it must be clearly established which matters were carried out incorrectly, with misguided goals and illegally. This must be regulated systemically, everywhere and immediately. We will study it and maybe even supplement it. ""
Hojs: After Golob left, the price of electricity at Gen-I was cheaper
Aleš Hojs blamed Robert Golob for the fact that electricity prices were too high under Gen-i, but that they had fallen since he left the position of President of the Management Board.
That's not true. Golob's term as head of Gen-i expired on November 17 last year. On our payment slip for November, as for the one for February this year, which was published on Twitter by the Minister of Infrastructure Jernej Vrtovec, the prices per kilowatt hour at high (VT) and lower tariff (MT) are the same: 0.06490 and 0.03599 euros .
The amounts on payment orders are lower due to the temporary freeze on the payment of network fees and certain duties, which was introduced by the current Janša government.
4,000 euros gross or net after the end of the term for Minister Hojs?
What benefits await Minister Hojs after the end of his term? 4,000 euros gross, as he claims, or 4,000 euros net, as Robert Golob claims?
Minister Hojs was until March 2020, when he became Minister of the Interior, employed at the State DRI Investment Management, Infrastructure Development Company, d. o. o. The law allows him to return to DRI within three months of the end of his term, and in the meantime he receives 80 percent of the minister's salary. How much salary he received at DRI is not a public figure, the company told us. However, if Hoys's claim that he will receive half of Golob's salary after the end of his term, which according to Hoys is 7,200 euros net - according to ours an average of one thousand less - is true, that still means 3,600 euros net salary.
Neither Golob nor Hojs provided precise data, but the salary of the Minister of the Interior at DRI was closer to EUR 4,000 net.
If he does not return to DRI, he is entitled to the benefit for a maximum of six months or until he finds a job (or retires). According to the latest data from the Ministry of the Interior, Aleš Hojs received a gross salary of EUR 5,778.59 in February this year; in rough terms, this is EUR 3,326.35 net, because we cannot take into account personal data that affect the amount of salary. The 80% compensation would therefore be € 4,622.87 gross.
Minister Hojs, along with other ministers, is in the 64th, the highest class, which by law belongs to office. The Prime Minister listed all the ministers there at the beginning of his term, and on 19 March 2020 he explained this on Twitter."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/povezimoslovenijo.html,Let's connect Slovenia,"The Connect Slovenia movement consists of the parties Konkretno, Zeleni Slovenije, SLS, NLS and Nova socialdemokracija. The main program of the movement is that they want to unite the three centers. Liberal Center with the party Konkretno, People's Center with both parties of the People's Party, and Green Center with the Green Party of Slovenia. The coordinator of the Let's Connect Slovenia movement, Nada Pavšer, emphasizes that the movement is open to both the left and the right center.","""It is enough to divide into left and right. Let's connect Slovenia. Let's move forward together,"" they say at Let's Connect Slovenia. According to them, any solution should first answer three key questions - what is good for people, what is good for the economy and agriculture and what is good for nature.
The party Konkretno is otherwise part of the government of Janez Janša. Zdravko Počivalšek is the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economic Development and Technology, Marjan Dikaučič is the Minister of Justice, Simona Kustec is the Minister of Education, and Boštjan Koritnik is the Minister of Public Administration.
According to Počivalšek, the ideological division of Slovenian politics has been stifling Slovenia's development potential for decades, and instead of finding common ground and connecting, most of politics is becoming more and more radical and polarized.
Počivalšek spoke for our portal in an extensive pre-election interview.
He also answered 10 quick questions that try to take a politician's view of some key political and social areas.

Connecting Slovenia is a movement for common sense, they say of themselves: ""We are cooperating with people who have different views and were once even political opponents. Political agreements are not easy, but discussions allow us to learn cooperation and tolerance. Slovenian political space. It is important to compete for good ideas, not to find differences. We are not talking about connecting, cooperating and finding optimal solutions, but we are living it. We want to turn Slovenia into a country of cooperation. ""
It follows from their program that they want to establish an alliance between Slovenian farmers and Slovenian consumers, which provides quality food to consumers and a decent life for farmers, and in case of emergency, this alliance is a guarantee that no one will go hungry. According to their proposal, over 300 million euros, which are spent annually on food in kindergartens, schools, hospitals, other public institutions, the army and other state institutions, should be given priority to food produced in Slovenia. They plan to intervene in health care: ""Without comprehensive change and unification of the organization, long-term personnel planning and transparency in the health care system, for the first time in history, our life expectancy will be reduced due to unnecessary deaths."" The Green Passage should not punish the poorest, they warn, adding that pensioners must not fall into poverty. They suggest that widows and widowers, after the loss of a partner, maintain such a share of his pension that they can secure a decent life.
A government group would be set up to review all new laws and amendments to laws in terms of the needs of young individuals and families.
They are also concerned about hate speech and restrictions on free speech: ""Never restrict speech by the authorities. In recent years, there have been growing tendencies to control increasingly offensive speech in public. But if we restrict speech, its suitability will always be decided by Since freedom of speech is too important for society's ability to find the most optimal solutions and change and correct injustices, the Connect Slovenia movement is committed to not supporting any tightening of current legislation in this area. ""

Participants emphasized the importance of EU enlargement, also in the light of developments in Ukraine.","As the Speaker of the National Assembly Igor Zorčič said in his address at the conference, Russian aggression represents everything that the EU strives for. The attack on Ukraine is an attack on the fundamental European values ​​of peace, democracy and coexistence of nations.
""Therefore, as leaders of key European representative institutions, we must be aware that the struggle of Ukrainians for peace and freedom is not only theirs, but the struggle of the entire European democratic community,"" Zorčič said. According to him, the Union has proved this with a united solidarity and decisive response, which it is further strengthening.
Many Europeans have opened their hearts and homes and are now offering help and refuge to millions of Ukrainians fleeing the horrors of war. ""Europe has shown that solidarity remains its fundamental connective tissue,"" he said. Zorčič notes that the parliaments of the EU member states have also played an important role since the outbreak of the war, with strong condemnations of Russian aggression and unwavering support for Ukraine and its people.
""Parliaments lent their vote to Ukraine and told the world that its future is in Europe, that we want it to become part of the European project,"" Zorčič stressed. He also considers the call for a solution to the crisis through political dialogue based on respect for democratic values ​​to be particularly important. He expressed joy that the gathered colleagues of the parliaments were also addressed by their Ukrainian counterpart Ruslan Stefanchuk via video conference today.
The future of Ukraine, however, is only a piece of the larger unfinished puzzle of a united Europe, he added. ""A comprehensive response to the current situation must therefore not be sought in the vacuum of the Ukrainian crisis. The EU as a symbol of progress and stability must maintain and strengthen its leadership in its entire neighborhood. Enlargement must remain one of the Union's key geostrategic tools priority, ""he said.
He is convinced that there is no time for unfounded hesitation. ""Due to the worryingly fragile stability of the Western Balkans, our clear messages to the region are more important than ever, as this is the only way to prevent the negative effects of the war in Ukraine from spilling over into this part of Europe,"" Zorčič said.
He considers it crucial that the enlargement process becomes even more dynamic and credible, and that the European perspective is clearly defined and tangible in time, as this encourages reform efforts. In this light, we must therefore expect concrete progress in the integration of the Western Balkans, and in this way also consider the applications for membership in the Union recently made by Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, Zorčič believes. He is convinced that their European future is in the interest of us all.
The EU must also pursue the most ambitious neighborhood policy. ""Intensive regional cooperation with the EU as a leading partner must become the norm to create a wide space of freedom, security and prosperity across the European continent. The tools to achieve this goal are available, and it is up to us to gather political will and use it,"" he said. .
The President of the Assembly of the Republic of Northern Macedonia, Talat Xhaferi, also thanked the EU for all its assistance and support in implementing reforms to join the Union. this is extremely important for the stability of the region.
He called for the European enlargement narrative to be adapted as soon as possible and to take into account the recent drastic changes in Europe's security, economic and energy landscape. ""We want the enlargement process to become more dynamic and accession negotiations to start as soon as possible,"" he said."

Mesca is bothered that politics has become such a theater and “we’re watching a reality show”. Fajon is harsh that the current government has taken away people's dignity, Tonin is reassured that there is no room for resentment in politics. Hojs defends a deleted tweet about refugees. Bratuškova points out that Slovenia is historically indebted. Šarec announces the ""normalization"" of the situation, while Počivalšek predicts cooperation with everyone.","With the confrontation of the presidents of the parties, which are ranked the best by public opinion polls, the pre-election campaign before the National Assembly elections also started in our media house.
We invited the presidents of the SDS parties, the Freedom Movement, the Social Democrats, the Left, Nova Slovenija, LMŠ, SAB and Connect Slovenia. Prime Minister Janez Janša traveled to Zagreb, and was replaced by SDS Deputy Prime Minister Aleš Hojs.
The topics they talked about are the most current: How to end the suffering in Ukraine as soon as possible and what can Slovenia do about it? And the consequences of the war in Ukraine, both for our security and for our pockets. How to limit price increases? About the coronavirus: will we emerge victorious or defeated as a society and as a country? Who will lead Slovenia for the next four years, what type of leader does Slovenia need in these difficult times? And what can we expect immediately after the election. What kind of coalitions are possible at all?
'We are watching a reality show, an episode in Kiev could mean a selfie in Kiev'
According to opinion polls, Robert Golob is the biggest rival of SDS and Janez Janša, but they have not faced each other so far. As he says, he does not believe in coincidences. “It’s definitely a plan,” he said. However, he hopes that Janša will gather courage and take part in some confrontation. Aleš Hojs defended his ""boss"" and said that Janša's trip to Zagreb was more important than participating in the show on our television and that there would definitely be a confrontation between them.
What do our guests think about sending a Slovenian diplomatic mission to Kyiv? ""Having the Prime Minister consult with everyone on this would pose an additional security risk, so it is right that he did so in strict secrecy,"" Hoys said. Tanja Fajon pointed out that such solo and heroic actions lead to additional conflicts. Matej Tonin said that Slovenia is not the only country that has a diplomatic mission there and does exactly what other countries do. ""She is an active member of the international community and we need to get this smallness out of our heads. We are doing what we need to do at the moment."" He is convinced that this is about creating internal political hysteria. Zdravko Počivalšek supported Janša's move, as ""the goal is peace as soon as possible"". Luka Mesec: ""It bothers me that politics has become such a theater. I'm sorry to watch a reality show, an episode in Kiev could be called 'sefie in Kiev'. All we watch is that the government is looking for ways to she will show that she is saving the world, while she did not know how to save Slovenia. "" He wants games like this to end after April 24th. Alenka Bratušek reminded that the trip to Kyiv is not the only solo action of this government. ""Solo actions are bad, they harm Slovenia and do not bring a solution to the Ukrainian crisis,"" she said. She reiterated that Janša could invite his friend Orban to go to Moscow and try to persuade the one who can actually end the war. ""Only a united world can lead to peace. Peace is the only solution we must pursue, solo actions do not help,"" Golob is convinced. Marjan Šarec said that Slovenia, as part of the EU and NATO, is pursuing a common policy and that is its role. ""It is not the role of our Prime Minister to provoke, get involved in the conflict and expose Slovenia to additional dangers. His task is to protect the citizens.""
Janez Janša's statement that airspace over Ukraine should be closed was similarly upsetting. Golob jokingly wonders how Slovenia will close its airspace over Ukraine, as it ""has nothing to contribute"". A ban on flights means a direct declaration of war, he is convinced, and this must be prevented. According to him, an initiative to establish humanitarian corridors on earth would be more useful. Hojs pointed out that Janša is the only one of the current presidents in the EU who has direct experience with the war. The initiative to close the airspace is in play all the time, he says. Mesec thought that Janša knew very well that NATO would not take him into account and that he was only drawing attention to himself with such statements. ""We want a prime minister who will think faster than a tweet!""
'The fence at the border is the biggest shame in the history of Slovenia'
One of the sad consequences of the war in Ukraine is the crowds of refugees. We have announced that we can accept up to 200,000 of them in Slovenia, so far we have accepted 7,000 of them. Will Slovenia be open to refugees from now on, or are Ukrainians an exception because they are culturally, historically and religiously close to us, as stated in a government tweet that was later deleted?
Hoys reiterated that this claim is a fact, although many would like it to be denied. """" The truth was written there! ""Asked why the tweet was then deleted, he did not answer.
Golob announces the removal of the fence from the Slovenian-Croatian border. Does this mean an open door policy for all refugees? The pigeon replied that a man in need is a man and this is the principle they uphold. The residents themselves who lived there once wanted the fence for safety, but now they say the fence is not working and they want to remove it as soon as possible. Mesec also says that the fence should be removed from the border because the distinction between refugees is ""ordinary racism"" and the fence at the border is ""the greatest shame in the history of Slovenia"". Počivalšek warned that we should not confuse economic migrants and refugees. ""We are open to refugees, and rules must apply to economic migrants,"" he said. However, he is also in favor of removing the fence from the southern border. Fajon says she would tear down the fence and arrange legal immigration routes. However, Hojs announced that they would not demolish anything in the SDS in the next term. Šarec reminded that we have a panel fence and cutting wire, which is completely inhumane in these times and must be removed immediately. Tonin said the fence is designed to prevent illegal migration and if we remove it, it will move to some other border. Bratuškova said that the government divides people into first-class and second-class people in Slovenia, not only among refugees. And even the tweet that Hoys “happily repeats from confrontation to confrontation is inadmissible”. “By doing so, they show a picture and an attitude towards people,” she said.
On the management of the covida-19 health crisis
They also talked about resolving the health crisis due to covida-19. While current representatives of government parties admit that they could work better in certain areas, such as communication, they emphasize that Slovenia emerged from this crisis as a winner in the economic field, as Zdravko Počivalšek said, praising the economic growth of Slovenia after the corona crisis. According to Alenka Bratušek, the government took advantage of this crisis, and they did well in filling the pockets of their friends.
The price of a bad fight against the epidemic was paid the most by retirees in the DSO and schoolchildren who had closed schools, he says. However, we have a long way to go for our supposed economic performance, as this economic growth is based on borrowing, which is not healthy economic growth, she pointed out. Tanja Fajon also agreed that our debt will give us a headache. Šarec said that politics came together during the lockdown, and the government then lost confidence with the PKP underlings. Golob pointed out that the current government first removed the profession in management, thus wasting people's trust.
On the newly adopted Personal Income Tax Act
Tonin and Počivalšek emphasized that with the new personal income tax law, all citizens receive higher salaries, but that the other political pole, which opposes this, wants to take it back immediately. Golob said that they will definitely change this law, because it makes them more wealthy than he admits, and citizens with lower contributions, who in his opinion really need it, but this law brings little struggle. As Fajonova also pointed out, this law deepens the differences: ""Of course, everyone wants higher salaries, those with a minimum income will have 13 euros more, and those with 40,000 euros gross will have 15,000 euros more. So those who have more, they will have even more. We would tax progressively. "" Šarec points out that it sounds nice that we will all have higher salaries, but the budget will suffer 800 million euros in damage. ""Such a clever measure can only be treated as a pre-election candy,"" Šarec assessed the government's move to adopt the personal income tax law. We will all have to face this law, he says.
Candidates on the food and energy crisis in Europe
The attack on Ukraine has exacerbated the energy and food crisis in Europe. Food prices are the highest in the last 20 years. From the beginning of February 2002 to the end of February 2022, they increased by more than 73 percent. What measures would candidates take in this area?
For the most part, the candidates agree to increase Slovenia's share of self-sufficiency and food independence. According to Golob, they would selectively lower VAT prices for some basic foods. Tonin emphasized that we should first of all change the way of thinking that it pays to buy from the local market, more needs to be done to encourage the sale of products from Slovenian manufacturers, he said. Bratušek replied that more Slovenian food should be produced the most.
The month advocates food and energy self-sufficiency. He emphasizes that dependence on fossil fuels in particular needs to be addressed. After the crown crisis, more needs to be produced at home, he points out. In my opinion, the state can help the poorest at the income level to correct the lowest incomes for these groups. Šarec believes that the most important thing is to ensure dietary independence from others. Food subsidies may also be needed in the short term if there is no other solution. In the long run, we must not forget the investments in irrigation systems due to drought and frost that Slovenia is facing, he reminded.
Who would work with whom?
The first tasks of the new government will be the normalization of the situation in the country and the return of democracy, the LMŠ predicts. Šarec says that the first measure is for everyone in the government to respect the law and be responsible for their mistakes. The second move is an audit of all personnel moves and transactions. ""What will be the difference from the government they were already in?"" The difference will be that the next government will be a majority and no longer a minority. We will all be at the same table, taking our share of responsibility, ""he announced.
Golob emphasized that they are already in contact with civil society and will remain so. ""Not us, the voice of the people is preparing systemic legislation that will eliminate the harmful measures of this government. We will support them. We will not write the legislation ourselves. We believe in the people,"" he pointed out. He added that 60 percent of voters want a different society - open, free, respectful, solidary. ""If we get a mandate, it will be clear - we need to lead to such a society."" He sees four potential partners in the studio for this. ""After the government, we will go into a coalition not only with the KUl, but also with civil society,"" he announced.
""We want respect. This government has taken away the dignity of the people, we are doing things differently,"" Fajon said. According to her, the prime minister-designate will be nominated by those who gather a sufficient number of votes and seats in parliament. ""I see four great allies here!"" She herself advocates a policy of dialogue, inclusion and cooperation, but does not see the possibility of cooperating with the parties of the current government coalition.
Tonin believes that there is no room for resentment in politics. ""The future government will have to be future-oriented, firm, with its own vision and not deal with itself or revenge. The more one is excluded, the more narrow the room for some normal cooperation. People will have to be taken care of and NSi is always present in such governments, ""he said.
""I always say that we will talk to everyone and agree with those who are ready to move on,"" said Počivalšek.
Bratuškova added that there are brave and reliable people in the SAB party who have not and will never betray their voters. That is why they signed an agreement with KUL some time ago. ""We are ready to work with such people in the future."" She is convinced of a strong center-left government.
The month says that they have two main goals in the elections - to change the government and come to the government with the Left. They want to be the party that will be the ""guarantor"" of not getting another Miro Cerar government, but a government that will do what it agrees to do. They are willing to compromise, he asserted.
Hojs, however, concluded that they are currently focused on the election campaign and reckon they will be relative winners. Janša will certainly invite all parties to the talks, but he personally would exclude the Left, because ""they are so different that they do not belong to any coalition"". ""But we will wait to see if what they say in KUL will come true, so if all four parties will cross the parliamentary threshold.""

The reason for the establishment was the upcoming local elections, as Šarec was initially active in local politics. In 2017, Šarec ran in the presidential elections, where he recorded high support, which then spilled over into the National Assembly elections, which took place in spring 2018. Marjan Šarec became Prime Minister, and after his resignation, after March 13, 2020, LMŠ became opposition party.","This is the second time that the party is running in the National Assembly elections, also this time under the leadership of Marjan Šarc, who was given a new mandate at the helm of the party on 19 March 2022 at the Electoral Congress.

What measures would you take to keep us from getting cold next winter and the shelves still stocked with food? Will young people be able to afford their own apartment? Today the situation is even worse than four years ago. What about foreign policy? Most parties, for example, are still in favor of NATO.","The analysis of pre-election programs was divided into two content sets. In the first we publish healthcare, economy, energy with environmental impacts, housing issues through the prism of youth, education, media, agriculture and defense.
We emphasize that if we did not find the answer in an individual election program, it does not necessarily mean that the party does not offer a solution elsewhere. We analyzed the programs of all parliamentary parties and the Freedom Movement party, which is placed at the forefront by various opinion polls. In the elections, the party Konkretno is running in the alliance of the Let's Connect Slovenia party, which according to the latest Mediana opinion poll enjoys 1.9 percent of support.
Healthcare
Supplementary insurance
The parties SD, LMŠ, SAB, Levica would abolish supplementary health insurance and place it under compulsory insurance. The LMŠ party is convinced that supplementary health insurance today is a market activity and instead of health care, part of the collected money is used for the profits of commercial insurance companies. The Gibanje Svoboda, DeSUS and Nova Slovenija parties would reform supplementary insurance, while Nova Slovenija would establish competition in the field of compulsory health insurance. The Svoboda Movement is announcing the transformation of supplementary insurance, when 600 million a year will be provided for public health funds within the framework of a broad social consensus. The SDS did not opt ​​for supplementary insurance in the program.
Concessions in health care would be abolished by the parties Nova Slovenija and Levica. The Left proposes that the concessionaires operate on a non-profit basis and return the surplus to the public health system.
'Amphibians in healthcare'
Against t. i. amphibians in health care, ie doctors who perform their work in public and private health care at the same time, would take action in the Left, the SAB, the Freedom Movement and the SD. The SD party would limit the work of doctors in the public and private sectors at the same time, afternoon work and other forms of supplementary work would be disabled in the Left. The SAB would clearly delineate the work of doctors in the public and private sectors. In Nova Slovenija, however, they advocate that medical staff who meet the standards would be allowed to work in the private sector, and that employees would also be rewarded for their work results.
Waiting times
The reduction of waiting times will be started immediately in the SD, the program predicts. Their goal is to reach a maximum of 30 days for a specialist examination. The SAB is also announcing a program to reduce waiting times. In the Freedom Movement, queues would be eliminated by a temporary measure - all doctors who are able to perform services can compete for performance. The SDS predicts that a competitive environment will lead to shorter waiting times due to more efficient work methods and cheaper services. They add that they will ensure timely access to a personal physician and specialist treatment. In Levica, they say that they will eliminate waiting periods with additional co-financing of programs that ZZZS pays after implementation. The LMŠ would allocate additional funds to shorten waiting times and establish legal possibilities for additional payment of employees. The SNS, like the others, is in favor of shorter queues and does not offer concrete solutions in the program.
ZZZS and other measures
In SD, the role of ZZZS would be strengthened and modernized, the renovation of ZZZS is also announced in Desus. The SAB party would increase the number of family doctors by improving working conditions and higher wages. Their priority is also the construction of a regional hospital in Ljubljana. The Desus party would introduce a legal obligation to involve all health resources in the country. In Levica, a public company would be established for the purchase of medical materials and medicines, thus limiting corruption and profiteering in this area. In the SNS party, priority would be given to health legislation, which would not include private individuals. They also support a central public procurement system without intermediaries. They are advocating for the legalization of cannabis.
The SD would gradually increase funding for public health. The DeSUS party would increase its share of GDP for healthcare to 9.3 percent. The Left Party would strengthen the public health system with additional funds, especially at the primary level of health care, accelerate the import of health personnel and increase the capacity of medical faculties. The client does not offer concrete solutions in the field of healthcare. In their program, they emphasize the importance of digitalization, which will put the patient at the center, and the reform of the Health Insurance Institute.
Economy
In the program, Konkretno, SAB, DeSUS, Levica and Gibanje Svoboda are advocating for a greener economy. NSi is advocating the withdrawal of the state from the economy, while the SNS should be bought out. Privatization procedures would be stopped in the Left. The tax relief of the economy was announced in the SDS, where, for example, small entrepreneurs would be allowed flat-rate taxation. The Slovenian state holding company would be transformed into the National Demographic Fund in the SDS and most of the state's investments would be transferred to it. They see untapped economic potential in wood. The same is true in LMŠ, where we would redefine the relations between the owners of forest plots and the state and encourage the sale of wood within various so-called ""wood exchanges"".
In Levica, the economy would be focused on the participation of workers in management and forms of workers' ownership of companies. Most concrete measures in the field of debureaucratization are offered by the LMŠ, which would reduce the number of regulations by 10 percent in the next four years.
Energy
The second block of NEK
The Ministry of Infrastructure, headed by Jernej Vrtovec, has issued an energy permit to Gen energija for the second unit of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant (JEK 2), but it does not have the support of all political parties in the construction. The SD party is convinced that the citizens should decide on the construction of the second block of the nuclear power plant in a referendum. The SAB, Desus, Gibanja Svoboda, Levica and LMŠ also agree with the consultative referendum. Support for the consultative referendum was also expressed in NSi. Their goal is for Slovenia to become a net exporter of electricity. This would be achieved through well-utilized renewable resources and the second block of the Krško nuclear power plant, which they support. In the Svoboda Movement, the second block of the nuclear power plant is conditioned by transparency and independence in managing investment decisions and respect for the decision in the referendum, as they say, only those nuclear technologies controlled by the Western world will be acceptable.
The Left would stop this project and hold a referendum first. The SNS supports NEK-2, and the SDS party is also announcing the construction of the second block.
TEŠ
Regarding the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant, which produces about a third of the electricity, only the Levica and Konkretno parties are specific. The Left advocates that the use of coal should be abandoned by 2030 and that the Šaleška region be restructured economically. The party specifically points to the reform of the energy sector. They advocate the closure of TEŠ in 2038.
Green energy and renewables
Let's look at customer commitments in the field of green energy, renewables and the concept of energy in the future. In Nova Slovenija, they are advocating a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. They would encourage solar power plants in degraded areas, and also support the construction of a chain of power plants on the lower and middle Sava. Solar incentives are also supported in SD, in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and introducing an energy cap to limit rising electricity prices.
The SAB party will complete the construction of a chain of hydroelectric power plants on the Lower Sava and begin construction on the Middle Sava. We would also set up a 3rd energy pillar for a faster transition to green renewable energy. Desus also supports investment programs for the construction of smaller solar power plants and the exploitation of the potentials of the Sava River and wind farms. They are in favor of banning technologies that threaten the quality of natural resources. The Freedom Movement would accelerate the solarization of surfaces and support the self-sufficiency of all forms. It would increase investment in the grid and enable the use of standing water, riparian and agricultural land for investment in renewable energy sources. We would reduce the role of natural gas, abolish the mandatory connection to the gas network for heating in individual new buildings and encourage heating devices to renewable energy sources.
The Left is encouraging a 60 percent reduction in greenhouse gases over the next two governments compared to 2005. It will provide a 2 percent of GDP financial framework to combat climate change, part of which will go to the decarbonisation fund and part to long-term adaptation. We would accept a commitment to decarbonise state-owned enterprises by 2030 and abolish subsidies for all fossil fuels by 2025 and reduce their use by 2035. We would launch a comprehensive program to build larger solar power plants and roof solarization, achieving 10% in five years solar energy in the takeover. The LMŠ party would invest in renewable energy sources such as hydroelectric power plants, solar cells and wind potential. We would increase the capacity of municipal waste incinerators, invest in companies that create sustainable jobs.
The SDS promises stability of electricity supply and a gradual transition to renewable sources, because Slovenia's energy concept should be based on new investments in competitive, sustainable, reliable and secure additional production sources. They promise lower electricity bills: we will streamline the operation of public services in this area, which means less pressure on the network and levies, which already account for more than half of the electricity bill, they predict.
Youth, family, education, media
Housing policy
Measures on how to get the first owner-occupied apartment are offered by NSi, SAB, LMŠ and Gibanje Svoboda. The Christian Democrats would establish a guarantee scheme for young families in this area, an image also in the SAB. The LMŠ would ensure that an individual could get their first apartment by paying rent, while the Svoboda Movement wrote that the state would guarantee the loan upon purchase. Housing issues in Levica would be tackled with the construction of 30,000 non-profit flats by 2030, and a public rental service would be opened in LMŠ. In the SD, municipalities would be empowered to set the highest possible rents.
DeSUS supports the construction of housing cooperatives, they will provide a greatly increased construction of rental housing for young families, the socially disadvantaged and the elderly.
Families
Families would be taxed in NSi. The basic income for children, young people under 20 and the unemployed would be introduced in the SDS. In public administration, 5,000 jobs would be allocated to young people in the SAB. In the field of education, free school meals for all are announced in the SD. The package of measures in the school system was prepared by the SNS. For example, we would introduce biology in the 6th grade, abolish descriptive grades in the first triad, and unify textbooks throughout Slovenia. A one-year course would be introduced for foreigners who would like to be part of the Slovenian school system. At all levels of education, they advocate for entrance exams. The SAB party would provide free public transportation for young people, high school and university students, and teach students about democracy in primary and secondary schools. The SDS is advocating for the renewal of curricula, so that they would allow more freedom to teachers, which would strengthen their autonomy.
The media
The SDS would also renew the media legislation, specifically how, they did not write in the program. However, they did so in the Svoboda Movement and the LMŠ. Both parties are in favor of independent and free media and legislation that would reduce political influence on public service broadcasting and the STA.
Agriculture
Self-sufficiency
The SAB party would promote its own self-sufficiency, local sales and consumption. They will try to increase their own food production by more than 80 percent in vegetables, fruits and cereals. They believe that we need to ensure 100% self-sufficiency in meat and dairy products. DeSUS also believes that the share of self-sufficiency should be increased and dependence on imports reduced. They identified this as a strategic priority for agricultural development. There are no concrete measures in the LMŠ to increase self-sufficiency in the program, but they wrote that the use of local food in public institutions would be raised to at least 40 percent. A special plan of work with farms and young entrepreneurs, better conditions for the transfer of farms between generations, a more favorable tax environment for agriculture and complementary activities, appropriate social policy and rural infrastructure would be established.
The Left Party is encouraging an increase in the amount of organically produced food, with the aim of increasing organic agricultural land by up to 25% by 2030. Battery-based animal husbandry would be banned and free-range farming encouraged. Animal protection controls would be tightened. The use of carcinogenic soil herbicides would be abolished and the control of antibiotics in food, especially meat, would be improved. We would end up advertising meat and dairy products and promoting plant-based foods. They promote sustainable forest management.
The SD party would improve self-sufficiency with locally grown fruit, vegetables and meat, focusing on the maximum share of organic production and at the same time promoting own food production and cultivation of smaller arable land (gardeners) and offering locally grown food in restaurants and other catering establishments.
In particular, the party believes that in the future we should strengthen Slovenian agriculture and achieve greater weight of domestic agriculture in the food industry chain. Their goal is high self-sufficiency of Slovenia with locally produced food. In the SDS, self-sufficiency in locally produced food would be enabled through an active agricultural policy.
The situation of farmers
The Freedom Movement would promote sustainable agriculture and establish green supply chains between smallholder farmers and end customers. In public food procurement, we would strictly require the purchase of food from local Slovenian food producers. The NSi party would ensure an adequate income position for farmers (possibility of agricultural insurance for family members, higher support for farms with very difficult cultivation conditions) and an expanded range of ancillary activities on farms. They promise more funds for measures for young farmers, more funds for adapting farms to new farming conditions. Strengthening the processing and marketing of own products.
The party Specifically supports the project of smart villages and measures to make the younger generations more attractive in agriculture. The SDS sees wood as a great opportunity for Slovenia's economic development. They predict a tax relief for farmers. The Agricultural Land Fund would be abolished.
The SAB and the Left say they will transpose the principle of the right to drinking water into legislation.
Defense and security
Then, investments in the military and conscription
The parties are not unanimous about the funds that the state budget would allocate in the future for defense and about Slovenia's role in NATO. On the one hand, the NSi party would raise defense spending to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2024, predicting the construction of a middle battalion battle group by 2026 and the continued modernization of the military and the purchase of new equipment. The SD will strive to provide a stable source of funding that will enable further modernization of the army. It would improve the social security of soldiers and further encourage voluntary military service. The SDS announces the establishment of a dynamic system of compulsory military training, the strengthening of the Slovenian Armed Forces in personnel and weapons, and support for the development of a national cyber defense system.
The Svoboda Movement is in favor of modernizing the Slovenian Army. Slovenian high-tech companies would have an advantage when buying equipment. They have a different position in the Left, where they are proposing to repeal the law on 780 million for arms purchases and to withdraw from all already concluded contracts. They believe that we should limit the purchase of military equipment to the equipment that the army needs to provide socially useful tasks. We would launch a public debate on the possibility of demilitarizing Slovenia. The LMŠ would establish national civilian readiness in a way that would connect the defense ministry with other parts of the critical infrastructure.
In the Left, they are against the introduction of forced military service. Compulsory military service would be introduced in the SNS party. The SDS announces the establishment of a dynamic system of compulsory military training, the strengthening of the Slovenian Armed Forces in personnel and weapons, and support for the development of a national cyber defense system.
The Left is strongly in favor of Slovenia's withdrawal from NATO, proposing a referendum and neutrality. They will also advocate the withdrawal of EU member states from NATO. The army would be withdrawn from NATO military operations abroad, and participation in peacekeeping operations will have to be decided by parliament. The SNS is also in favor of Slovenia's withdrawal from NATO, and their defense policy should be based on armed neutrality outside military alliances. Opposite NATO membership is supported in Nova Slovenija. However, the SD believes that a referendum on NATO membership is not necessary.
Police
In Nova Slovenija, in the field of police, they want to strengthen the number of uniformed police work, they announce the introduction of t. i. foot patrols, modernization of police infrastructure and re-establishment of heads of police districts. They will also advocate the construction of a national civil protection center and three regional sub-centers. The SD party will advocate the immediate abolition of all measures of political subordination of the police. They are announcing the reorganization of the General Police Administration, the abolition of the complete subordination of the Criminal Police Administration and the Uniformed Police Administration under the GPU. The SAB is also advocating for the depoliticization of the police and the army. They also support the strengthening of cyber security and the prosecution of hate speech.
The parties Konkretno and Desus do not mention defense measures in their program.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/predvolilna-politicna-bilanca.html,Pre-election political balance,"Turbulent four, especially the last two years. First, the unexpected resignation of Marjan Šarc. With the advent of the new government, a new, epidemic reality. Now another Russian attack on Ukraine. So where is Slovenian politics at the beginning of the election campaign?","Janja Božič Marolt, director of Mediana, which measures public opinion, is convinced: this year's elections will be historic. ""There are some factors that can influence the outcome and previous participation in elections, which we have not faced in Slovenia so far. This is mainly due to the covid, which in a way still continues, but is in the background. Ukraine, which also concerns us directly: the fact is that a new paradigm has been established more strongly during this time, the center-right has become stronger than it was in previous elections, and the center-right has recently played a much stronger role in the traditional media. Slovenia. ""
And what can be the impact of the war in Ukraine on elections? Dr. Marko Lovec from the Department of International Relations at the Faculty of Social Sciences believes that harsh words about the attack and - albeit courageous - the Prime Minister's extremely risky trip to Kyiv are aimed at the domestic public and that it is a distraction. ""We see some aggressive rhetoric, with this same government and this same prime minister moving away in the past, criticizing the future Bidn administration, attacking China. But we were very reticent about the role of the Russian Federation in Europe. Moreover, Putin's friends, such as Orban, Salvini and others, were also great friends of our ruling party, and to cover up this awkwardness, this lack of strategic understanding and consideration, some aggressive rhetoric is used in relation to what is happening. in Ukraine. But this, except on a symbolic level, does not help Ukraine significantly. ""
Dr. Samo Bardutzky, head of the Department of Constitutional Law at the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana, has been assessing the past years mainly through thinking about the constitution and constitutionality. And here the government - when it encroached on human rights in the care of the lives and health of citizens - often crossed the line. ""In Slovenia, it went across the border. This is not only my opinion, but we also had decisions of the Constitutional Court and other courts, including other independent institutions, which quite warned that it is not acting in a constitutionally consistent manner. This can be ""But even when there is a justified encroachment on human rights, this must be done in a lawful way, in a proportionate way. And, of course, from this point of view, it has absolutely gone beyond the border.""
Hana Košan is the president of the Kings of the Street Association. At the start of the epidemic - when they had to open a new, temporary shelter for the homeless overnight - they felt tremendous solidarity. Now, he warns, there is growing hostility in society again. ""With the rhetoric on some political level, when this political top is sensitive to all criticism or all the things that are happening, you can see how it affects a general social situation and opinion. If we received a lot of support in 2020, now people on the street are reporting that they are being persecuted, where they can offer a newspaper, for example. This division always has the greatest impact on the margins of society. ""
So what is the pre-election political map like after two extraordinary years? How does it show the parties on the government side, how on the opposition side? Can the cards be shuffled again for the fourth time by a party rookie? Will it go to the knife this time too?"
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/pod-mojim-vodstvom-smo-bili-v-druzbi-neproblematicnih-drzav-niso-nas-pristevali-med-razgrajace-v-razredu.html,"'Under my leadership, we were in the company of unproblematic countries, we were not counted among the breakers in the class'","Marjan Šarc is accused of opening the door to the government of Janez Janša with his resignation. But the LMS leader - although he accuses Jansa of ""declaring a holy war on democracy"", says his party has always remained true to its values ​​and has not clung to power at all costs. In the pre-election interview, he assures that the old divisions of the possible new government will not be resolved, and regarding cooperation with the Left - ""if Mr. Kordiš had to lead the department, a lot of this rhetoric would fade away"". He also spoke about his views on the war in Ukraine and analyzed the biggest challenges of the future government.","You were very critical of the moves of Prime Minister Janez Janša when it comes to the war in Ukraine, you said that the Prime Minister is like a breaker in a class that does everything on its own. So you wouldn't act that way. But what would you do if you were the Prime Minister?
In fact, it all started with a proposal to ban flights over Ukraine, which would complicate NATO as a whole into a war with Russia. Then we continued on our way to Kyiv, and now we are unique in sending a military mission to Kyiv. The problem with this mission is that the host country has a duty to ensure the security of any such diplomatic mission, which, of course, Ukraine is not capable of at this time because it has a lot of work to do with defense.
When it comes to the question of what kind of behavior would be right, and of course such as the behavior of other countries. Slovenia is not a big country and is therefore all the more vulnerable, so I do not understand the behavior, which is again creating panic. It repeats a story we’ve already seen with the covid, it creates a feeling like the Russians are almost on our border.
It is necessary to act in accordance with the unified policy of the European Union and NATO, and not to further provoke or explain on all televisions, as if Slovenia is the main one in this conflict. No!
The Slovenian government has the task of dealing with the consequences of this war. Fuel is irritating, and consequently other goods, such as food, inflation is also rising in the euro area - around 6.2 in the euro area, and the figure for Slovenia is already seven. In short - this inflation is devouring economic growth, economic growth will fall. And these are the problems that Slovenia has to deal with at the moment.
Because war goes its own way. This is a war between Putin and Ukraine, not between the Russian and Ukrainian nations. Therefore, such actions do not contribute to the solution, nor do the statements that could complicate Slovenia in an additional conflict.
So Slovenia cannot make a concrete contribution to peace in Ukraine?
Ofcourse not. The main events will take place between the European Union, the United States and the rest of the world, as well as Moscow. There is a solution to this war in Moscow, because Putin is an attacker. We all know that Ukraine has been attacked, we are all helping Ukraine. And here the opposition has no problems, we in LMS have no problems with that either. Ukraine needs help.
However, a military diplomatic mission in Kiev will not help. Imagine another grenade falling on our diplomat. And then?
Every war, like other crises, must be resolved with a sober head. Heroism as such is a beautiful thing, but it doesn't help much if there is no common sense. And all the other missions are currently in Lviv, which is also happening on some common line. As far as our Prime Minister is concerned, however, it is more intended for domestic politics to create the image of a hero, and then Zelenski did not even mention him last time.
You said this is not a war of the Russian people, but of President Putin. But is it possible to actually draw such a clear line between a nation and its leader?
It is certainly possible. After all, our Prime Minister also has very ""Putinist moves"". He attacked the media, journalists, and was convicted of a tweet insulting a journalist. However, we certainly cannot claim that the Slovenian nation is equal to this policy - and this is also the case in Russia, where there has been strong propaganda for 20 years.
We had good relations with both Russia and Ukraine. We had € 1.3 billion in annual turnover with Russia and € 400 million with Ukraine, and this war changed everything.
But we can never equate a dictator with a nation. We have seen this in history. And Russia will still be there after the war, which will sooner or later end at the green table, as it will have to. That is why I always distinguish between nations and leaders.
We do not hate Hungarians because of Viktor Orban. We know that Orban is an unsuitable politician for the EU, but that does not mean that we are in conflict with the Hungarians.
What is your assessment of the Slovenian and global security situation? Geopolitical centers of gravity are shifting. What attitude would you take towards Russia, China and the US? Where is our city, what threatens us?
Slovenia is a member of the EU and NATO and must strive for a common European policy, just as every country in the European Union is responsible for making the European Union's policy as uniform as possible. Because only unity can save the European Union.
Recently, we have a different way of making decisions in the EU, the European Council decides, where there are 27 leaders and decisions are a bit slower. However, you have listed countries where the opposite is true. But Slovenia must certainly act in accordance with the policy of the European Union.
Slovenia is certainly not threatened by security or the military, so I say that panic rhetoric is not good. However, like other countries, it is threatened by the consequences. Inflation, darling and everything else.
However, we would of course be better prepared to expect this darling if we did not distribute so much money in the obvious period. At that time, the government was distributing money, and it was bragging about it, but now it is a cash register, I will not say that it is empty, but it is also indebted. And I hope that the European Union, as the signals come, will postpone the return of the fiscal rule, because we will need financial reserves to deal with the darling. However, if we know that the record holder in coveted supplements got 81,000 euros, then we know how these supplements were distributed and it will warm us not to have strategic money to subsidize the price, energy prices, as well as curb inflation. Interest rates are already rising, as this is practically the first step in tackling inflation, but it is causing other problems.
In short, there will be many challenges, including in terms of energy. Freezing, regulation, we like, but this has led to fuel providers abolishing the discount for truckers. When truckers have more expensive fuel, everything else becomes more expensive, goods become more expensive and we get into a spiral. It is therefore essential to react with excise duties, as well as room for maneuver with VAT. Of course, this entails an impoverished budget.
And we come to a key problem when the government convinces us that with income tax reform, everyone will have higher salaries. True, wages will rise. However, the lowest very little, the highest slightly more, but the tax on meeting fees of supervisors will be reduced. In the end, the result will be an 800-million budget drop. But where will we replace this?
All this therefore threatens Slovenia and this will employ the future government - to eliminate the consequences of these problems as effectively as possible.
Somehow, during your tenure, it was considered that foreign policy was not your strong point. Let us remember the cancellation of the speech before the European Parliament. What will be different this time? Was that a missed opportunity?
At the time, the President of the European Parliament was Antonio Tajani, who showed fascist tendencies. Here we must remember his speech, Long live Italian Gorizia and Italian Istria. So he showed some neo-fascist tendencies. And since the term of that parliament was coming to an end, and the president was him, I decided not to run there.
As for the fact that foreign policy was not a strong point, the opposite was true. After all, foreign policy is not a loud policy. Diplomacy must not be loud, so it is called diplomacy, and Slovenia under my leadership acted in such a way that we were in the company of unproblematic countries, that we had no problems with the rule of law, we were not counted among the breakers in the class - Poland, Hungary , where they have serious problems with the rule of law, and Slovenia has now joined them. We aspired to the core countries, we were on good terms with the Benelux. In short, our foreign policy was what the foreign policy of a country like Slovenia should be. That it follows European values ​​and that the people of this country live in peace, that they can work, that they can function - and engage in politics as little as possible. Such was our policy: calm.
Even the current government says silent diplomacy is at work. But when it comes to relations with Croatia, for example, we do not see results. How would you achieve the enforcement of the arbitration agreement?
Of course, we don't see them because they don't exist. However, if the results of the silent diplomacy of this government will be the same as they were in 2008 in Bled, when Janez Janša and Ivo Sanader met, we know how it ended. Then President Borut Pahor went into an arbitration story, which also has its problems. But if we respect the rule of law, if we respect international commitments, treaties, then we must also respect arbitrarily decisively. Andrej Plenković and I also talked in Brussels every time we met, but I did not deviate from the implementation of the arbitration award.
If we go back to two-sided editing, then I'm afraid we'll lose something else. You know, Croats are our neighbors, we have good relations, we go to sea with them… But in diplomacy they cannot be trusted.
We know that Jadranka Kosor was the first to say that the arbitration was dead when it was compromised in Croatian terms, but the court found that the compromise was not so great and the process can continue. Therefore, for Slovenia, as one that respects the rule of law, it is only logical that we implement the arbitral award - and I have always insisted on that. I still insist today. That is why when Janša and Plenković go into silent diplomacy, I am quite worried.
If we stay with security for a while - you did not support the 780 million investment plan for the army, what is your vision of the Slovenian army? Your party is part of the KUL coalition, and last time our interlocutor was the coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, who has quite different views on the organization of the Slovenian army. How difficult will coalition negotiations on this topic be if this happens? What are you not willing to deviate from?
In LMŠ we have always supported our army, we will always support it because it is ours, because Slovenia also has a long military tradition. Let's just remember General Rudolf Maister. Without him, we would not have Styria today, Celje would no longer be Slovenian and we would practically not have a state. So we are not against investing in the Slovenian army, it must be said.
However, we are against reckless investments. And our orientation has always been to buy as much equipment and those means of transport that are also suitable for civilian use. Our wish, for example, was to buy three helicopters. There have been tendencies to buy the Cougar, which is exclusively a combat helicopter, but we have insisted on the need to buy helicopters that are also suitable for rescue.
When I came to the government, I also immediately stopped buying boxers - due to inexpediency. We were afraid of the ""new patria"", that is a fact, and the question is how effective armored vehicles are for Slovenia. We also see in Ukraine - if you have enough armored weapons, you can defend the country. Ukraine is a big country and Slovenia is small.
That is why this investment law you mentioned is a law on paper. We do not need a special law for procurement in the Slovenian army. This is again a law that sounds nice, but the question is whether there will really be so much money that we will be able to make all these purchases. So it’s more sand in the eye. However, given that the purchases are based more on armor than on anything else, we did not agree with that.
Cyber ​​defense needs to be strengthened, helicopters suitable for rescue need to be procured, and personal equipment for soldiers needs to be purchased. I repeat, investments must be prudent.
So you would not withdraw from the army in negotiations with the Left?
No, certainly not, because the Slovenian army is the Slovenian army. The left may have such a position, but we have decided to be part of NATO, we have decided to have a Slovenian army, and there is no debate here. However, as far as the Left is concerned, I must say that they did not oppose our purchases for the army, because there was a lot of equipment that also benefits the people.
In 2019, your agreement with the Left fell apart. Can you explain what was going on then? The left, for example, says you weren’t a serious enough partner. Were mistakes made? As well, what else can be done to prevent the situation from recurring with a potential new government?
The left saw things differently than the parties that were in the coalition, because when you sit at the government table and when you have a portfolio, you have to show results. These are completely different feelings than if you only support the parliament and the government from afar.
And this will be a key and different matter in the next government. That they will all have to or will have to be at the same table and all take part of the responsibility.
I, too, often listen to Mr. Kordiš and smile, but if Mr. Kordiš had to lead the department, I think that a lot of this rhetoric would also fade away. When you are a minister, people demand results, they are not interested in debate. Therefore, I have no dilemmas that the future government will be different, because we will all be at the table and everyone will have to take responsibility.
The future government will also be the majority government, because in the LMŠ we would never go to a government that does not have 46 votes in the National Assembly. If there is no such majority, then the government finds it difficult to survive. Maybe this is happening in Scandinavia, but in Slovenia it turned out not to be.
When your government said goodbye - even that morning few people knew about your resignation. What knocked the bottom of the barrel?
At that time, the Left terminated the agreement, DeSUS was already not securing five votes because Robert Polnar went on his own. In his speech at the celebration, President Pahor spoke about how the government should undertake structural reforms, but we vetoed almost every law, at least ten vetoes of the National Council… We also adopted the budget only because Zmago Jelinčič took pity on us Andrej Šircelj was absent. It was similar with Minister Mlinar. When we add it all up…
If you want to be a democratic leader, then it is perfectly normal in the Western world to either go for a vote of confidence or want new elections. And that is the only way in a democracy.
This government, which came as the majority and turned into a minority, is sticking to buying votes, but it is not possible to achieve the systematic changes that Slovenia needs. It needs reforms, a structural breakthrough, a green transition… it needs projects that will need to be adopted by big consensus. We need to talk about nuclear energy. And this cannot be done with a government where you depend on Mr. Branko Simonovic, Polnar… This must be a solid government that has presidents at the same table and everyone is breathing in about the same direction. I didn't have that.
The government started with 18% support, which is such low support that no government with such low support has finished yet. So from the beginning, it was difficult to predict the length of life of this government. Then, already in November, Matej Tonin said that talks were taking place on the other side… So there was a situation in which you cannot make decisions that are a matter of broad consensus.
But do you think that now, at this point, yes or no, you can assure the electorate that the new government will not repeat the old divisions?
Yes. If everyone sticks to what they are saying today, then it will not.
Let's move on to a potential coalition. Robert Golob announced negotiations. Will the KUL parties negotiate individually or together?
How he will negotiate, I do not know. But let's wait for the election. Because of this, in fact, everything happens. Let's wait for April 24 - results and relationships. For us, there is no dilemma that the government must be center-left, and we will behave accordingly. But also in line with our result and what is happening in the country as it is today, and in the desire that this never happens again. I don't see any big problems myself.
But will KUL appear together in the talks, even before the elections?
The KUL agreement was signed when there were no new players. The agreement clearly states that the government is formed by the one who gets the most votes. But that was before the new players. We now have a new player on the political scene, but it is difficult to predict the results, so let’s wait. There is no need for hasty statements. All that is known is that the five of us, as things show today, will form a government, and people expect us to.
You once said better Šarec in hand than Dove on the roof. Do you see Robert Golob today as a potential Prime Minister?
That statement was made when Mr. Golob was not yet there. Now Mr. Golob is on the scene, he has appeared, and I certainly see everyone as a prime minister who has his own party that achieves results in elections. There is no dilemma here. Whoever scores in the election will lead the government.
But what will happen if the sum of the KUL parties gets more votes than the Freedom Movement? Who will be the prime minister? President Pahor also wants answers.
As I said, I think it is too early today to talk about what the totals will be and who will be the prime minister. We have another month of campaigning and then elections. However, I personally will not pay too much attention to Mr. Pahor, because I think that he has long since lost any credibility, especially during this government with this servility.
The government will be formed with or without him, as has the previous one. At that time, Mr. Pahor was very sympathetic to Mr. Janša, he spoke of me as the second-ranked candidate in the elections, not even with his name and surname, so we know that he wanted to be Mr. Janša - maybe he is doing well now - given that until recently he had Ernest Petrič as his advisor, but we know where he belongs.
If we touch on the projects of the future government - the sour apple that will have to be bitten is healthcare. You promise all clients - we will arrange healthcare. But let's be very specific - how will you arrange for us to be able to access a personal doctor faster and in person, and not through telemedicine, which has proven to be a bad solution?
In fact, it must first be honestly said that healthcare will never be regulated to the extent that we will say, but now everything is regulated. Healthcare is an area that every government needs to regulate every day and monitor what is happening every day.
As for telemedicine - it is urgent to start again with normal examinations, operations. In 2019, we concluded an annex for two months and gave an additional 10 million euros for surgeries, and then it turned out that the number of surgeries was just over 5,000 more, in short, it proved effective because people are waiting for surgeries - including patients with cancer and other cases. We don’t even know today how many people have died to us because they didn’t get treated.
It is certainly necessary to strengthen family medicine, to make the profession of family doctor attractive, so that more doctors will decide in this field. Working conditions also need to be regulated, and the administrative burden on family doctors needs to be reduced, as administrative burdens take up a huge amount of time that could otherwise be used for treatment.
What we have been saying for several years is the expected digitalization. In healthcare, we have a basic problem that we do not have information-related institutions. Waiting times are such that we still don’t know how many people are waiting where, but we might be able to redirect them. This is just one example. These are not partial solutions, there are many.
And, of course, this unfortunate abolition of supplementary health insurance, at which all governments broke their teeth. This must also be done, because the current supplementary insurance is not additional, but mandatory. We all know you can't get anywhere without it. A good example is dentistry and healthcare should not be allowed to happen to him, as happened to dentistry. Amphibians are the main problem. Operating tables are occupied in the morning, empty in the public sector in the afternoon.
I am not in favor of going with fire and sword over them because I myself am not prone to prohibitions. Just as we are not in favor of compulsory vaccination, compulsory elections, we are not in favor of orders here either.
However, doctors should only be allowed to work in the afternoons when they have fulfilled all their obligations in the public sector. There are still many reserves, including in the organization of work and digitalization.
Only then are finances here. And, of course, it has to deal with corruption. Purchasing medical equipment is a thing that also cripples healthcare.
The current government has invested in the construction of homes for the elderly, and the competent ministry states that in 2018 and 2019, three million euros were planned for the construction of homes for the elderly, and 30 in last year's budget, which is ten times more. Why such a difference?
I think it was five million, which is a small number, of course. However - what is the key to this information? That previous governments had a fiscal rule. You probably remember that in 2019, the opposition at the time wanted a constitutional review of our budget, which was in surplus, saying that we were violating the fiscal rule.
When the covid came, the fiscal rule disappeared, the state was able to borrow indefinitely, the bond yield required was even negative, in short - by removing all restrictions on borrowing, any government would go to build.
However, we had to abide by the fiscal rule, which was adopted by the government of Miro Cerar with the help of the SDS. At that time, the SDS had a lot to do with the fact that today we have such a rigorous fiscal rule. So - yes, the numbers hold, but any government would invest if it had. We were not allowed to, and this government has no restrictions, which will be shown when all these loans that were given to the people have to be repaid. Well, then we will see when maybe Janez Cigler Kralj from the opposition will shout how they set everything up nicely, and the government is not doing anything. At the same time, he will not say that borrowing has risen, that the fiscal rule may have returned - I hope not - and that debts need to be repaid. That is the essence of everything.
Food security is no longer a matter of course. How would your client solve the problems of Slovenian agriculture? Slovenian agriculture has been neglected for years, and in the domestic supply chain the differences between purchase and sale prices are so high that many farmers are considering abandoning their activities. How, specifically, would you solve the problem?
I myself come from a family where we abandoned this activity. We had four tails in the barn. We abandoned this somewhat because of illness, and partly because it didn’t pay off. In the past, we had farms where they were on duty in the morning, farming in the afternoon. But the situation has changed and such farms, unless you have a lot of love for such a way of life, are not profitable. You’re right to note that this has been dragging on for years, and I’m not going to throw sand in my eyes here right now and say we have magical solutions.
It is a fact, however, that we will all need to pay more attention to these issues. Spring flowering is coming and there is a great danger of frost, if frost comes, then we know that the crop will be pruned. If we happen to survive without frost, hail is promised. If we are spared this, there will be a drought. In short, the Slovenian farmer has a lot of problems with force majeure alone. Climate change has hit hard here and we as a country will have to invest in irrigation systems. We will have to invest in sprinkling. Even when it comes to counter-current systems - the Austrians have a counter-current defense, we have never come to this solution. So all this is a huge problem.
The key problem for Slovenian farmers is the purchase price. And purchase prices have fallen in times of crisis, but have never returned to the old level because it cannot compete with retail chains. For a quality piece of meat of Slovenian origin, the price cannot be in cents. We are almost self-sufficient in meat, except for pork, where the self-sufficiency rate is only around 40%, we are not self-sufficient in vegetables and fruit either… It is also a problem because we are an importer of cereals. And administratively it can be said that we will sow more, but - whether the harvest will bear fruit, we can not know. And farms are overgrown, farmers have a lot of problems with bureaucracy. Today, the farmer must be practically 100% digitally literate, he must be an administrator, an entrepreneur… Bureaucracy could be cut. We also know from European tenders that we in Slovenia are even more complicated than we should be.
Is there a fear that the party will fail to get into parliament?
No one knows what the results will be. We are sure that we will come to the parliament and I see no reason why not, because we have worked hard, the last two years also in the opposition and people have seen us. They saw our parliamentary group, we set up two investigative groups, one of which deals with actions during the epidemic and the other investigates the impact of politics on the police. We have been active, people see that we are consistent and we have not clung to power at all costs. We are going to the polls with complete confidence, and only a fortune teller can predict the number of seats.
What would electoral success be for you?
In 2018, our party, which was not previously parliamentary, received 12.6 percent of the vote, which was enough for second place, but far behind the winner. At that time, our goal was to enter parliament and get the best possible result. And even now, for us, success will be the best possible result.
The political space is polarized, politics enjoys an extremely low level of trust. How will you contribute to changing this? Who from the opposite sex are you willing to work with?
We have already done a lot for this. In our government, people took responsibility, even our Secretary-General took responsibility when he made that call. Our actions speak for themselves, we had standards. Of course, we are not without flaws - not me, not our members, no one is without flaws, but I think our party is among the last to be blamed for distrusting in politics.
As for the opposite sex, I don't know. I find it difficult to cooperate with Mr. Janša if he does everything he does, if he oppresses the media, pursues a Putinist policy against RTV Slovenia, against STA, other media, does not attend confrontations, court hearings, does not pick up mail… Mr. Tonin started losing his truck masks, then the party of its vice-president directly recruited to Dars, we see octopuses as they rapidly withdraw politics into the economy. In the party Konkretno, there is nothing left of the Liberal Party, which was defended by Miro Cerar. Not to mention the actions of this government, which are corrupt, and in the time of the covid, people were fined 400 euros for eating a croissant, and the like…
We therefore find it difficult to work with these clients. But this is a minority of parties. With the other clients, there are now five of us in the middle left, but I don't see a problem getting together and working together.
Our party has done a lot to trust politics, we wanted even more, a change in the electoral system, which was already prepared by Rudi Medved when he was still a minister, but there was no political will. But we will continue to do so. By changing the electoral system and abolishing the Council of State.
So you will not meet Janez Janša before the elections?
No, no need. It is impossible to cooperate with a party that publicly invites you to participate and, on the other hand, beats you.

A heartbreaking, fateful, longing and full of twists and turns comedy series, a parody of the creation of television content, humorously answered questions that are usually asked by viewers. Who? What? Why? How?","A group of enthusiasts, led by Slavec, a former pumper and newly appointed program director of PRVAK TV, managed the impossible. Despite constantly throwing logs under their feet, they created the Superk *** e series with incredible ratings. Word of their success quickly spread and stirred up the media space, and this is where the story of the new politically motivated owners from Cyprus begins with the renaming of PRVAK TV to PATRIOT TV.
New owners, new stories, new politics in Season 2
Telenovela: Patriot TV
The PATRIOT TV team is expecting the procurator of the new owners from Cyprus, the attractive, ambitious and uncompromising media manager Svetlana, who wants to prove herself and create an informative program tailored to the new owners and politicians. She is portrayed by Montenegrin actress Marija Bergam. She joined the established team with the intention of turning television into a propaganda news program and creating a political show tailored to politics. At first, she sees Slavec as a professional, Dončič among television people, and the embodiment of all the changes she wants to introduce, but she soon learns the truth about Slavec's success and (in) abilities. Former actors and the Superk ** b team are now becoming journalists who will deal with current political topics ... However, they will also hone their acting skills in a special series dealing with Slovenian history, filmed in secret, but in parallel with political propaganda. .
Our team would not be our team if this story was not followed by a lot of absurd twists. Slavc turns the understanding of the second track into something that is organically much closer to him - the second pir, and the news will be created, somehow similar to how they created the series in the first season - in their own way - according to the script. Whether it will be absurd to accompany their success this time as well, VOYO users will find out on April 10, when they will be able to watch the second season on the spot.
Celebrity cast
Already known teams Bojan Emeršič, Branko Šturbej, Jure Henigman, Nina Ivanič, Ivo Ban, Gregor Gruden, Gaja Filač, Nejc Cijan Garlatti, Vidi Cvar, Uli Furlan will be joined in the second season by Marija Bergam, Petja Labović, Zvezdana Mlakar, Niko Zagode , Desa Muck, Aljaž Tepina, Ana Urbanc, Tina Vrbnjak and others.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/ukrajina/slovenija-v-kijev-v-kratkem-posilja-oborozeno-vojasko-diplomatsko-misijo.html,Slovenia is sending Lieutenant Colonel Boštjan Lesjak to Kyiv,"According to our information, the government will send a team of volunteer diplomats to the capital of Ukraine, but they did not find it at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but at the Ministry of Defense. Lieutenant Colonel Boštjan Lesjak, who is married to a Ukrainian woman and knows the country very well, is to be chosen as charge d'affaires. On Thursday, Janez Janša is expected to inform the leaders of NATO and the EU at the extraordinary summit in Brussels.","According to our unofficial but reliable information, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been frantically searching for a volunteer for several days who would be willing to risk his journey and work in the besieged capital of Ukraine, but was not among Anže Logar's team in Mladika. Thus, the government turned to the Ministry of Defense and found an officer there, Lieutenant Colonel Boštjan Lesjak, who is married to a Ukrainian woman (which he later denied) and knows Ukraine very well. He was also in Kiev a few weeks ago after the start of the Russian invasion. Lesjak used to be very active on Twitter, but he has now deleted his profile there.
He was temporarily transferred to the diplomatic service, employed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and sent to Kyiv with the team. The situation in Kiev is not the best, the Russian army has been pushed a little further from the city center, but the northern parts are shelled almost daily by rockets and grenades.
This is a very unusual move of mixing the army, politics and diplomacy, which is not a new solution by Janez Janša. He has sent his long-time friend and climbing partner, Brigadier General Bojan Pograjec, from the army to politics several times and then back to the army. From the army, he took Janša Pograjc, who was also present at the Prime Minister's visit to Kiev, to the cabinet for the Secretary of State, and now he is supposed to go to diplomatic waters, for the ambassador to Poland.
Tonin: I’m glad we have brave people on Morse
On the sidelines of the NSi pre-election event, Defense Minister Matej Tonin said in this regard that ""this will be a clear message to Ukrainians that we believe in their success"". He added that direct communication and exchange of views is easier live.
""I am just happy to have brave people on Morse who are also willing to take risks in these times to help the Ukrainian people and the whole of Europe to achieve peace,"" he said, according to STA.
He did not comment on more specific details about the mission. ""Once all the procedures are completed, you will be informed of all the details and names. It is a diplomatic mission where the leading role is played by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which must prepare the appropriate procedures, which are eventually approved by the government,"" he said.
MFA: Slovenia is sending a temporary charge d'affaires to Kyiv
Following the publication of our article, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Slovenia was sending a temporary charge d'affaires to Kyiv to carry out diplomatic tasks there in the manner and according to the procedures set out in the Foreign Affairs Act. They wrote that the said law does not provide for an armed military diplomatic mission.
The Ambassador of the Republic of Slovenia to Ukraine has been in a temporary location in Poland near the Ukrainian border since March 21, where he performs all diplomatic duties, including maintaining consular assistance and maintaining contacts with the diplomatic corps, they added. When asked why they send a charge d'affaires to Ukraine if the ambassador is doing his job, they answer that this is not unusual.
The Foreign Affairs Act states:

When the post of Head of Diplomatic Mission is vacated, his function shall be performed by a temporary charge d'affaires appointed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

If the head of the diplomatic mission is absent or unable to perform his function, his function shall be performed by a temporary charge d'affaires appointed by the head of the diplomatic mission in agreement with the Minister.

If there is no diplomat in the mission, the current member of staff of the diplomatic mission entrusted with the replacement by the head of the diplomatic mission shall only carry out current administrative matters and protect the archives.
The Foreign Ministry wants ""Slovenian politics to maintain unity in condemning Russia's aggression against Ukraine and for the current war in this country not to become part of the election campaign."" This is exactly what other political parties accuse Janša of:
Janez Janša planned the visit to Kiev just before the invasion and therefore put the members of the delegation in danger, who were preparing the visit from a security and protocol point of view. Since the war broke out, they tried to evacuate a member of the delegation for several days, which they eventually succeeded in doing with the help of other EU countries. Although the situation in Kiev is now even worse than at the beginning of the war, the Prime Minister is sending an unusual military diplomatic mission there, which will not be able to do much diplomatic work, and their presence will be a powerful symbol with plenty of risk.
Announcing that he would send a Slovenian diplomatic representative to Kyiv, the prime minister wrote online that ""Ukraine also needs direct diplomatic support in order to end aggression and peace as soon as possible."" ""If the whole EU does not have someone in the diplomatic corps who is at least as brave as a Vatican diplomat, then we are not worthy of having diplomacy,"" he said, adding that this also applies to Slovenian diplomacy.
He had already pointed out that it was important for other heads of state to visit Ukraine and show their support, and for the EU to return the representative to Kyiv."

They were filed in Ljubljana units 3 and 4 in the presence of party president Robert Golob, who will also run in these units. Candidate lists were submitted with the support of more than 2,000 signatures. Golob says he is happy with the candidates and predicts victory in the election.","All candidate lists are balanced by age and different interest groups as well as different backgrounds, where people come from, said Robert Golob at the filing. They are convinced of winning the elections, as they also feel the support of the people on the ground, and every day, according to him, new sympathizers, supporters and experts come to them who want to participate in the reconstruction of the country. ""The great support of the people fills us with hope and confidence that we will be able to make this project possible,"" said the president of the Freedom Movement.
Golob believes that the reconstruction of the country will be necessary due to external circumstances that are not in our favor. ""We are going from a health crisis to an energy crisis, to a Ukrainian crisis, etc. We also have a crisis of democracy in Slovenia,"" he said. The Svoboda Movement is convinced that now is the last chance to turn all this in Slovenia's favor. Golob believes that by activating citizens and their dormant capital in banks, they will ""create new value"" and thus fill the state coffers, ""he added.
Regarding his candidacy in the Ljubljana units, Golob emphasized that analysts played a decisive role in this, as they want to achieve the best possible result. According to Golob, Nova Gorica already has a strong candidate, former mayor Matej Arčon. ""We have one goal and that is victory, and we also subordinate who is running where,"" Golob said. The coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, is also running in the same districts of Ljubljana as Golob. Asked who will win this fight, Golob replied: ""Do you think I doubt myself? I have never doubted myself, the Freedom Movement will certainly celebrate.""
When asked about Saturday's participation of Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković in the Svoboda Movement congress, Golob emphasized that he had been invited as the mayor of the municipality in which the congress took place, not as a politician. He also said that he was happy to have the support of any citizen, especially if it was public, which he considered fair. ""Not that he is doing this from the background and then possibly even trying to issue some bill after the election. We do not even want such support and we also reject it,"" he stressed."

At the election congress, LMŠ delegates extended the term of office of Marjan Šarc for another term, which promises affordable and quality health care, energy prices and measures for economic growth. In an interview with Uroš Slak, both of them emphasized in the 24UR ZVEČER show that the common goal of the center-left is to achieve so many votes in the elections that they could form a stable government.","Šarec emphasizes ""normalization"" as a precondition, under which he lists the elimination of all disputed articles from all previous PKPs, t. i. subterfuges, the depoliticisation of the police, an end to pressure on prosecutors and the media, the fight against corruption and the abolition of supplementary health insurance. Golob announces a new social agreement that will be ""based on respect and a socially just and solidary state"". He says they want to restore people's confidence in politics and bring back to the polls those who may have given up in the past ""precisely because of the bad practices that politics, especially the ruling one, has staged so far."" He promises that in health care reform, they will first tackle public procurement and that they will ""step on the toes of those amphibians who exploit the public system in order to enrich themselves.""
Šarec says that their goal is to get as many votes as possible in the elections: ""It is not essential to win relatively, it is essential that you have enough votes to form a government and I think this space is enough,"" he reminded Zoran Janković. he failed to put together a government victory. ""That means you need partners and the common goal is for the center-left to get enough to form a government."" At the same time, he claims that he was never in favor of background calculations: ""If you want to shape Slovenian politics, then do as Mr. Golob did when he decided to go to the polls with his party, which I think is the right move. ""
Golob also sees Šarč's party as a good ally and not a competitor. He says that they share many goals together, and LMŠ assesses him as a credible party that has not deviated from its values. He believes that after the elections they will form a stable government together with the other parties of the KUL coalition: ""The goal of this election, which I call the holiday of democracy, is to say goodbye to the authoritarian regime. one mission, in the victory of democracy. How the votes will be distributed among us is much less important at the moment. "" He sees a stable government not with 46, but with 55, maybe even 60 votes.
""It is necessary to achieve such a result that the center-left as a whole can achieve so much that it can form a stable government, so that it will not be like the previous one, which dealt with its existence every day. I think we all we have learned in these two years that on this basis, after the elections, we can all start approaching this project without a fig in our pocket, otherwise we will have a fourth Janša government, which is certainly not in the interest of any of us, ""Šarec points out.
The war in Ukraine has brought another great challenge and the issue of Slovenia's energy self-sufficiency is increasingly at the forefront. In the long run, it will be necessary to use all its natural potentials, and the public will also have to inquire about nuclear energy, Šarec believes. The pigeon would eventually direct households to solar energy and industry to the transition to hydrogen. ""I am not in favor of the Russian gas embargo, as long as it runs, let's use it, because unfortunately it is still the cheapest. If we introduce an embargo today, we will only raise natural gas prices in Slovenia. I see no need for that, because we will have to pay for it. us and our households, ”he concludes."

The deadline for submitting candidate lists for the National Assembly elections will expire on Thursday, and the election campaign before the elections on April 24 will officially begin. For the most part, the parties have already completed their candidate lists. They feature both experienced politicians and new faces, or already familiar faces, but from other fields.","To one question, all parties have the same answer, that their candidate list is excellent and that they promise: ""Hard work, sweat and tears to achieve these goals, which we wrote down in the program,"" said Jernej Pavlič from the SAB party. . Tanja Fajon from the SD party says: ""Today, the Social Democrats are presenting 86 excellent candidates.""
Among the candidates of the SD party are Jonas Žnidarič, Milan M. Cvikl is returning, and the candidate is electrical engineer Emilija Stojmenova Duh. The core of the LMŠ list are the current deputies. Jerca Korče from the LMŠ party explains: ""We don't have any special stars, but we have people who understand how politics is built from the bottom up.""
Many point out that they have an almost or completely age, professional and gender balanced list. ""Although the leaders of this connection are male heads, we do not exclude anyone. We value people according to their abilities,"" Marko Balažic said.
Nova Slovenija is appearing on billboards with five ministers, most recently Minister Mark Boris Andrijanič. ""Such a decision is not just the decision of one man, it is the decision of the family, in my case the decision of my wife and me,"" explains Andrijanič.
The SDS believes that they are the political force of Slovenia's independence, present and future. ""I just hope that actions, those sincere actions, when it is clear who is who. And who has a reputation in the international community, will also awaken Slovenia,"" said Branko Grims, an SDS MP.
The main competitor of this party will obviously be the Freedom Movement party, which confirmed the list yesterday. ""There are many candidates who have not been exposed, you will meet and see them at any time, so I would not single out individuals,"" Andrej Ribič said.
In addition to the candidates, the parties also count on the support of prominent individuals. Yesterday, the mayor of Ljubljana promised a vote to the Svoboda Movement, Sanda Češko is shaping SD's economic policy, and Slavoj Žižek is publicly supporting the Left. ""He was never afraid to resent. I am in favor of our party being the same. So not a party that bends and goes for what is popular,"" said Left coordinator Luka Mesec.
The Civic Initiative Voice of the People has developed the online tool Volitvomat, which allows voters to check the extent to which they share views with one of the parties. Coalition parties are still waiting for answers."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/ukrajina/ruski-napad-na-ukrajino-med-varnostnimi-razmisleki-in-putinovim-sovinizmom.html,Russia's attack on Ukraine: between security considerations and Putin's chauvinism,"A recording of a controversial lecture given by the famous professor of international relations John J. Mearsheimer at the University of Chicago in 2015 is circulating on YouTube. The title of the lecture is ""Why is Ukraine the West's Fault?"" and at the time of my writing it already has over 20 million views. Mearsheimer, one of the most famous proponents of the research paradigm called realism in international relations, suggests that the West is causally - but not morally - responsible for Putin's takeover of Crimea in three ways.","According to Mearsheimer, (a) NATO's continued enlargement to the threshold of Russian superpower, (b) the European Union's similarly persistent enlargement, and (c) Western support for pro-democracy protests in Ukraine are the three main structural causes of Putin's takeover of Crimea in 2014 and Russia's general invasion. His argument is that all three threaten the geostrategic interests of the Russian superpower and that we can expect an endangered Russia to behave the way all endangered superpowers behave. By this he means that he will not tolerate the breaking of his ""sphere of influence"" and the transformation of the states on his doorstep into allies of his enemy (the United States and the West in general).
Mearsheimer points out that the American superpower would have behaved similarly if the roles had been reversed. Think, he says, of whether the U.S. would tolerate China’s military alliance with Mexico and Canada and China’s building military bases in one country or another. What’s more, the U.S. has behaved similarly in the past when it was in such a role. The Monroe Doctrine of 1823 was a declaration by the United States declaring any political involvement of foreign forces throughout the Western Hemisphere — South and North America — a potentially hostile act against the United States. If Europe or anyone else interferes in the American sphere of influence, this will be recognized as a threat to US security interests.
None of these facts, of course, justify Russian (or American) aggression. Mearsheimer's realism - morally speaking - neither advocates nor criticizes such behavior of the superpowers, but only describes and speculates how they behave and how they will behave in different situations. His 2001 magnum opus is entitled The Tragedy of Superpower Politics. He repeatedly mentions Thucydides' saying, ""The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must."" Ukraine, like any sovereign state, has the right not to interfere with its sovereignty (or to apply for membership in international institutions) - but the superpowers of states, according to Mearsheimer, are unfortunately unfortunately not respected.
It should come as no surprise that this academic lecture, which the public would not otherwise be interested in, has more than 20 million views. Let me mention just two sets of reasons.
First, Mearsheimer’s analysis is bold, as many Western analysts do not attribute causal responsibility to the destruction of Ukrainian sovereignty. Michael McFaul, Obama's US ambassador to Russia between 2012 and 2014 and a famous proponent of the research paradigm called liberal institutionalism in international relations, argued strongly with Mearsheimer in 2014 in Foreign Affairs magazine and live at a Chatham House seminar. his explanation. In early March this year, University of Chicago students expressed disappointment over - as they wrote in their letter to the dean - the fact that Mearsheimer was “spreading Putinism”. Many political advisers and academics complain about Mearsheimer on Twitter, either because of the immorality (or, as some think, the immorality) of his analysis, or because of the alleged descriptive fallacy of his analysis.
Secondly, if Mearsheimer turned out to be right with his analysis, his retrospective lecture could be said to have been justified as a warning and to follow his advice to prevent the tragic invasion he has been talking about since 24 February. the world. Those who agree with Mearsheimer's analysis argue that this year's war is one of the clearest (though tragic) proofs of the truth of realism, according to which the world is no less immune to the bloody policies of superpowers in the 21st century. Liberal institutionalists were convinced that it was a thing of the past, but according to realists it is still with us, as it stems mainly from the eternal state of anarchy and uncertainty that permeate international relations.
Is Mearsheimer right? What are the main reasons for Putin's invasion? Were security considerations and the rational (albeit tragic and immoral) behavior of the Russian superpower really central? Or is Putin a bloodthirsty chauvinist who wants to destroy Ukraine (or annex it to Russia) because of his cultural and territorial imperialist dreams?
Let me first list a few arguments that can challenge Mearsheimer's analysis:
(1) Significant cooperation between Russia and the United States between 2009 and 2012, despite the previous NATO enlargement and the Bucharest Summit in 2008, when the West rejected Georgia and Ukraine's membership but expressed support and promise to become one of them in the future. NATO members. The implication of this fact is, firstly, that the same structural constant - NATO enlargement - cannot explain Russian aggression in 2014 and 2022 and at the same time Russian cooperation between 2009 and 2012. Secondly, the implication is that it is very important who is leading it. . Liberal institutionalists argue that Putin has a much more aggressive tendency than Medvedev (who led Russia during its cooperation with the West between 2009 and 2012). Liberalism includes this variable in its analysis, realism does not (only the structure of international relations is important, not the personalities of the heads of state).
(2) The West does support (also through NGO funding) pro-democracy tendencies in Ukraine, but there is no solid evidence that it was directly involved in the overthrow of the pro-Russian regime in Ukraine in 2014 when Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia.
(3) Putin's speeches reveal his true intentions. It is clear from the pre-invasion speech, Mearsheimer's critics, that he was not concerned with security interests and was not primarily afraid of NATO enlargement, but dreamed of a greater Russia, the restoration of the Soviet empire, and cultivated chauvinistic cultural and territorial resentments. Ukraine.
(4) How could an invasion be the realization of Russia's security interests when it was clear that a Russian attack on Ukraine would unite the West and make NATO stronger? Putin needed to know, critics say, that he would strengthen his Western enemy by attacking, which is not in line with Mearsheimer's analysis. However, it is in line with an explanation that highlights Putin's irrational imperialist ambitions.
(5) If NATO enlargement is such an important reason for Russian aggression, why have we not seen this same aggression before, say in the 1990s and early 1990s, when enlargement began?
(6) The internal characteristics of regimes, such as the backwardness of the Russian economy and Putin's personalist dictatorship, are more important in determining the dynamics of international relations than the external structure of power relations. Couples of democracies and economically developed countries do not fight each other, but mixed (or dictatorial) couples do. I wrote in detail about this democratic and capitalist peace in my book Rational Choice and Democratic Government.
Mearsheimer would defend himself as follows:
(1) NATO enlargement is not the only reason for Russian aggression. The pro-democracy changes in Ukraine, supported by the West, were a key trigger for the crisis of 2014 and subsequent tensions (NATO is merely a structural factor in the background).
(2) Following the Bucharest Summit in 2008, Putin made it clear that the promise of NATO and Georgia membership in NATO was a direct threat to Russia's security interests.
(3) Russia invaded Georgia in the summer of 2008 (also) due to NATO enlargement.
(4) If Putin has territorial, imperialist ambitions, why didn’t he take over Crimea before February and March 2014? It took over only after the fall of Yanukovych's pro-Russian regime in Ukraine, and this could be interpreted as proof that this territorial appropriation was linked to security interests, not necessarily imperialist ambitions.
(5) Monroe's doctrine and the conduct of the United States since it became a superpower suggest that even developed democratic superpowers - superpowers not commanded by Putin - typically act in accordance with changing balances of power in their favor. Putin's behavior, then (regardless of his and American immorality in doing so), may be merely standard superpower politics, not irrational, dreamy imperialism.
(6) Russia did not behave aggressively at the beginning of NATO enlargement, as it was too weak due to the chaos of the 1990s. If she hadn't been too weak, she would have been aggressive by then.
(7) The internal characteristics of regimes are of negligible importance when it comes to international relations. Differences in power and drive that all superpowers have due to security considerations, ie. the pursuit of domination over their region of the world are the key factors of geopolitics, not democracy or dictatorship, complex or simple economy.
So who is right? It is difficult to say that Mearsheimer's three sets of factors (NATO, EU, pro-democracy support) were not important. In fact, it seems obvious that they are explaining - although of course they are not morally justified! - the aggravation of the situation between Russia and the West over the last decade. But I am also convinced that Mearsheimer's analysis overlooks or at least greatly underestimates Putin's imperialist dreams, which are really clear in his speeches.
Most importantly, however, it seems to me that Mearsheimer seemingly forgets the lessons of his own theory when explaining Russian aggression. Namely, aggressive realism presupposes that all superpowers - when they have the opportunity - try to expand their influence for the sake of their security and become a regional hegemon. This means that even with the delay in NATO enlargement to Eastern Europe and in the absence of pro-Western support for Ukraine, Russia would try to dominate its region of the world at the right time and the (weak) countries around it would fall under the wheels of Russia's geopolitical machine. According to aggressive realism, all the superpowers sooner or later behave like revisionist forces trying to achieve hegemony. Then up or down, Russia would at some point try to restore its former hegemony and sphere of influence.
Would the war we are witnessing today happen in this alternative scenario? If Putin is a rational actor, as Mearsheimer suggests, he probably really isn’t. If he is an imperialist chauvinist, as the Liberals claim, he probably is. Neither assumption is innocent, and in any case, Ukraine's future would be unenviable."

The country is increasingly devastated and abandoned. More than three million people have already fled their homes. In the morning, sirens sounded again in the west for the danger of an air attack. Several explosions were reported from Lvov, where Russian forces allegedly bombed a military depot, and also attacked Kiev's Podil district. In besieged Mariupol, the last supplies of water and food are running out, and the fighting has already reached the center of the city, which is turning into a ghost town. After the bombing of the Mariupol Theater, 103 people were rescued from the shelter, but more than 1,300 are still trapped under the rubble. According to the Ukrainian MP in Odessa, dozens of people were killed in a Russian rocket attack on the barracks in Nikolaev.","This morning, air raid sirens sounded in several areas of western Ukraine. Alarms sounded in the regions of Rivne, Volyn, Lviv, Ternopil and Ivano-Frankivsk. Explosions are also expected in several cities in Ukraine. According to the Ukraine 24 television station, the explosions erupted in various parts of the city of Lviv in western Ukraine at around 6.30 am local time (around 5.30 am local time). On its Telegram channel, the television posted a video showing a large cloud of smoke in the city. Explosions were also reported to have erupted in Dnipro.
Later, the Kyiv City Council announced that the Russians also attacked the Podil district of Kiev this morning. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko told Sky News that rockets that fell on part of Kiev this morning damaged six buildings. He added that the attack was aimed at a residential area without a military base. Asked what he expects to happen in Kiev, he said he believes an attack similar to those in Mariupol and Kharkov will happen.
Meanwhile, the American Institute for War Studies has estimated that Mariupol is likely to fall in the coming weeks. Although Russian forces have not made much territorial progress, the institute notes that the complete destruction of Mariupol and a more extensive attack on its civilian infrastructure could lead to capitulation and a final fall. ""The fall of Mariupol could be inevitable,"" they added.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has reappeared and warned anyone trying to join Russian forces in Ukraine that this would be the worst decision of their lives. “Long life is better than the money they offer you for short life,” Zelenski said. He added that Ukraine has information that the Russian army is recruiting mercenaries from other countries, but that this will not help it. Ukrainian forces continue to control all key areas, he added.
Zelensky also said they had captured a few more Russian soldiers. He sent a clear message to their mothers: ""Any mother who knows that her son was sent to the war against Ukraine should check where her child is at the moment. Especially those mothers who cannot get in touch with their children, those who are told that their children are supposedly dead.The phone numbers you can call and you will find out what happened to your children have been published.We did not intend to capture thousands of soldiers.We do not need 13 thousand dead Russian soldiers.These We didn't want a war. We just want peace. And we want you to love your children more than you fear your own government. ""
Zelenski thanked the U.S. for additional military aid, but said he would not disclose what the new package contained. ""This is our defense: the enemy does not know what to expect from us."" He added that Russia expects to treat Ukraine as it did in 2014, when Russia occupied Crimea without a fight and supported separatists who took control of Donbas. ""Ukraine is now another country with a much stronger defense,"" he said.
After talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the Ukrainian president said he expected rapid progress in approving the application for EU membership. Von der Leynova has promised to do everything in her power to speed up Ukraine's accession to the European Union. ""We will become a full member of the EU,"" Zelenski said, adding that bureaucratic processes, which usually take years, will be accelerated and shortened by months.
Angry attacks in Mariupol, satellite images show destruction
Meanwhile, evacuations of civilians from the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, took place at night. More than a thousand people are expected to leave the city by bus and car, Ukrainian sources said on social media, adding that the evacuated are now ""in a safe place"". Rescue of people trapped in a theater in Mariupol, which was the target of a Russian attack on Wednesday, also continues. This triggered a wave of outrage around the world and condemnation that it was a war crime, as many civilians had taken refuge in the theater before, and in front of the building, a large inscription ""Children"" in Russian also pointed this out.
According to one of the Ukrainian MPs, Serhiy Tarut, there are at least 1,300 people in the shelter under the theater. Local authorities have so far talked about about a thousand civilians. The shelter is said to have withstood the attack, although the building above it was destroyed, and the number of victims is not clear yet.
The French news agency AFP quoted Ukrainian ombudsman Lyudmila Denisova as saying that some adults and children had managed to get out of the theater and that rescuers were now searching the ruins and trying to unlock the basement where the shelter was located. According to the Ukrainian side, at least 2,000 civilians have been killed so far in Mariupol, which is the target of a horrific Russian siege, and 80 percent of the city has been destroyed. The US think tank ISW, based on information from US intelligence at night, estimated that the city is likely to fall in the coming weeks.
More than 100 people are now expected to be rescued from the shelter, Ukrainian ombudsman Liudmila Denisova said. But 1,300 of them are still trapped under the rubble, she added. The Ukrainian president said rescue work was under way, adding that continued shelling by Russian forces prevented authorities from establishing effective humanitarian corridors to the besieged port city.
Greek Prime Minister Kiriakos Mitsotakis said Greece was ""ready to rebuild"" a maternity hospital that was destroyed in the bombing of the besieged port city of Mariupol. He described the city as the center of the Greek minority in Ukraine. ""It is a city dear to our hearts and a symbol of the barbarism of war."" His message came a day after Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said Italy was ready to renovate the city’s theater there. ""The theaters of all countries belong to all of humanity,"" he wrote.
New satellite images of Mariupol show more destruction caused by indiscriminate Russian bombing. Huge pieces of blown up civilian homes are clearly visible.
White House: Biden warns China of the consequences if it helps Russia
Chinese President Xi Jinping told US counterpart Joe Biden in a video interview that the United States, along with China, is responsible for maintaining world peace and stability. However, according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Ukrainian conflict is not of interest to Jinping. ""China and the United States are permanent members of the UN Security Council and the world's leading economies. We should diligently bear international responsibility and strive to ensure world peace,"" he said, according to Chinese television.
""The crisis in Ukraine is not something we want to see,"" the Chinese president said in a nearly two-hour conversation. He also told Bidnu that relations between the countries should not be strained towards military hostilities, which has been the biggest Chinese criticism of Russia's attack on Ukraine so far.
Biden hoped to convince Jinping at their first conversation since November not to get involved in the war in Ukraine on Russia’s side. A little later, the White House also made a statement about the conversation between the Chinese and American presidents, announcing that everything revolved around an unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine. Biden presented Xi's views on the US and allies, described measures to prevent and respond to the invasion, including sanctions.
He described the consequences of China's assistance to Russia during the brutal attack on Ukrainian cities and civilians. The president emphasized his support for a diplomatic solution to the crisis. that U.S. policy toward Taiwan has not changed and the U.S. continues to oppose any unilateral changes to the status quo, ”the White House said.
The conversation between Biden and Shi indicates that communication channels between the United States and China remain open, the White House said before the talks. The two leaders are also expected to discuss other issues of common interest. China has so far not clearly condemned the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Beijing has not supported a resolution in the UN General Assembly condemning the attack, but has abstained. However, China has denied US allegations that Russia, against which the West has imposed harsh sanctions, has asked Beijing for economic and military assistance.
On Monday, Bidn's national security adviser Jake Sullivan met with Chinese High Representative for Foreign Affairs Yang Jiechi in Rome. Meanwhile, eight years have passed since the formal Russian annexation of Crimea. On this day in 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin formally signed an order to annex this Ukrainian territory. This connection is not recognized by the international community. Ahead of the anniversary, Putin said on Thursday that recent years had shown that the decision of the people of Crimea to unite with Russia was the right one. Shortly after the annexation of Crimea, the situation began to worsen in eastern Ukraine, where pro-Russian separatists took control.
China has good relations with Moscow, but is economically dependent on exports to Western countries.
Eight years after the capture of Crimea, Putin addressed the stadium
Eight years after Russian troops occupied the southern Ukrainian region of Crimea, the event in Russia was greeted by crowds of people waving flags at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium. Authorities there said more than 200,000 people had gathered at the stadium, but that, according to Reuters, could not be independently verified.
The broadcast of the Russian president's speech at the full stadium was suddenly interrupted. The Kremlin explained that the interruption in the transmission was due to a technical error, and the entire speech was broadcast later. ""We know what we have to do, how to do it and at what cost. And we will absolutely realize all our plans,"" Putin said in a speech at the stadium.
Special lessons have also been prepared in schools during the ""Crimean Spring""."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/interni-nadzor-razkril-prave-krivce-za-neverjetno-dolge-cakalne-vrste-v-ortopediji.html,Did Samo Fakin open Pandora's box by supervising the work of orthopedists?,"The special internal control requested by the management of the University Medical Center Ljubljana after the revelation that some orthopedists were registered at the workplace, but in fact worked for another contractor during that time and thus unjustifiably received obvious allowances, revealed that in the field of orthopedics the government chaos. In 2019, as many as 15 out of 23 employed orthopedists were underburdened on average. While a full-time doctor, this year's record holder, performed 2,104 outpatient examinations, one of them can boast of only 359 examinations.","In February we reported that orthopedists who falsely registered at the orthopedic clinic of the University Medical Center Ljubljana, claiming that they were at the clinic - in fact working for another contractor at the time - had to return a little less than a thousand euros to their employer. Most of these are unjustifiably paid covid allowances received for working at the clinic. The Public Sector Inspectorate then found that there were such hours for which they received an unjustified allowance, 86.
As the waiting times in the field of orthopedics are among the longest in the country, and at the same time abuses were found at the orthopedic clinic, a detailed analysis of events took place at the University Medical Center Ljubljana. The contents of the report were not disclosed to us at UKC Ljubljana, saying that it was an internal document intended only for consultation within UKC, but the content of the control was first discussed by the Delo newspaper and then by one of the initiators of internal control, a former Minister and former director of ZZZS Samo Fakin, who is a member of the council of UKC Ljubljana.
What did the internal investigation reveal?
Among other things, the analysis calculated the workload of individual orthopedic specialists, and the findings are worrying. According to Delo, in 2019, out of a total of 23 orthopedists with outpatient examinations per hour, 12 were below average, while with other outpatient examinations, 16 were below average, and 11 were below average with surgery. Taking into account patients in all programs, as many as 15 were underburdened on average. By August last year, the situation had improved despite the epidemic, as there were ""only"" nine out of 20 orthopedists.
Fakin points out that the aim of the inspection was to determine whether there are reserves to reduce waiting times and what needs to be done to regulate this. And what did they find out? “We’ve found that there are reserves,” Fakin says, adding that these are large reserves. In essence, he points out that with a steady load of doctors and regulation of the situation at the clinic, there would be no waiting times.
In 2019, a full-time orthopedist performed an average of 25 small procedures shorter than 30 minutes, 75 small procedures shorter than 60 minutes, 136 procedures shorter than 120 minutes, and 43 procedures longer than 120 minutes. According to a rough calculation, it devoted 468 effective hours to operational activities, or one third of all expected hours. The annual realization of a doctor in orthopedics averages 1,430 hours, according to Delo. There are also differences in the area of ​​inspections performed. In 2019, the full-time record doctor performed 2,104 outpatient examinations, while his colleague with the fewest examinations performed barely 359. His workload per hour for a full-time orthopedist was only 0.54 hours, so below average. There were as many as 15 such orthopedists in 2019. The situation was slightly better in 2021 (until August), when eight orthopedists were under average.
Fakin: A third below average
The record holder with the least realized hours had as many as 1,791 ""missing"" hours in 2019, while his colleague, who has only an 80% share of employment at the clinic, worked 3,453 hours in the same year. The differences are huge. ""A third of them are underburdened below average. These need to be overburdened, and waiting times would be shortened,"" Fakin said. For Delo, Fakin pointed out, ""all data on the work of doctors are entered into databases, but no one systematically monitors them."" According to him, the heads of departments should be in charge of this, and the director of the institute is in charge of them.
""We have a serious problem, but no one is dealing with it,"" Fakin said, adding that we have data on the workload of doctors, but unfortunately no one is monitoring it. ""When I was a minister, I demanded that doctors work effectively six hours a day, and everyone laughed at me."" According to him, the differences in productivity between orthopedists are 3 to 1, which means that some of them work three times more than others. If doctors really did their job, the queues for examinations and procedures would be significantly shorter or non-existent, and there would be no need to pay for additional programs to shorten them.
Fakin is clear: ""Politics does not decide on the basis of numbers, but on the basis of union pressures."" After the disclosure of supervision over orthopedists, he will request the preparation of an annual work plan by a doctor at the University Medical Center Ljubljana and the Celje Hospital, where he is the supervisor. As he says, they already have this at the primary level.
Revealing worrying data, SD MP Dejan Židan wrote to Health Minister Janez Poklukar, warning him that ""what is happening in orthopedics in the institution is far from appropriate or effective management"". He asked the Minister who, in his opinion, is responsible for the poor organization of work on orthopedics in the UKC LJ, which is shown by the data. He is also interested in whether similar findings would be made if similar analyzes were performed by other departments or clinics at UKC LJ. Židan is still wondering whether the situation is similar in other Slovenian hospitals. Židan is also asking the authorities to answer questions about whether below-average orthopedists have received consent to work for other health care providers and how much work they have done for them.
We also sent questions to the management of the University Medical Center Ljubljana about further measures and responsibility for the situation in orthopedics, but we have not yet received answers. We also asked them if they were planning internal control or if they had performed it in another department. We have not yet received this information either."

As in the US Congress and the British House of Representatives, he was greeted with standing ovations in the Bundestag. In his speech, he described the war in his country as a new wall in Europe and criticized Germany. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, meanwhile, stressed that he continues to support Ukrainian forces that uphold the right to self-defense, which is also enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Similarly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz provided further support, but stressed that NATO would not intervene.","As he told German MPs, Russia is building a new ""wall"" in 21st century Europe with its attack on Ukraine. He compared the current events to the Cold War period, when Europe was divided by the Iron Curtain and the German capital by the Berlin Wall.
We are fighting for our lives and we are convinced of what we have felt before, but the world has not seen it clearly. We are separated by a wall, a wall in Europe that divides freedom from non-freedom, and this wall is getting bigger with each bomb and with any decision that is not made, ""Zelenski said.
He called on the Berlin authorities to support Ukraine's application for membership of the European Union and asked them for more help. Ukrainians want to live freely and not submit to another country, and have been the target of Russian attacks for three weeks now. ""In Europe, we are once again witnessing attempts to destroy an entire nation,"" he warned.
He accused Russia of destroying everything Ukrainians had built in Ukraine, from hospitals to schools and churches, and of killing thousands of people, including at least 108 children.
He thanked the Germans who help the Ukrainians and the German journalists who sincerely report on Russia's crimes, but at the same time criticized the German government and economy.
He particularly highlighted Germany's delay in disrupting the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which would bring Russian gas straight to Germany and bypass Ukraine. According to Zelensky, Berlin rejected calls for Ukraine to withdraw from the project in the run-up to the Russian invasion, saying it was ""just an economy"". He added that it was painful to watch German concerns protect their ties with Russia, which were also used to finance the war.
""We asked what Ukraine should do to join NATO, but we got the answer that this decision is not on the agenda yet. Now we are asking if Ukraine can join the EU. For some it is a policy, but if we are asked to do so. If we ask for preventive sanctions to show the aggressor that you are strong, we have seen how you are procrastinating with them because of the economy. Now the economic relations between your country and the country that provoked this war, the bridge over the wall that separates us. ""
""We are fighting for freedom, defending values ​​without your support. Why is the country on the other side of the ocean closer to us now? Because we have a wall that we do not see, but it is growing,"" he said. ""It is difficult to defend Ukraine and Europe without the help of the world.""
Stoltenberg and Scholz provided further support to Ukraine
During his visit to Berlin, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg emphasized that he continued to support Ukrainian forces that preserve the right to self-defense, which is also enshrined in the United Nations Charter. Similarly, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz provided further support, but stressed that NATO would not intervene.
""President (Vladimir) Putin's war against Ukraine has shattered peace and shocked the world,"" Stoltenberg told a news conference before the meeting.
Although NATO believes that NATO's first husband has a responsibility to prevent further escalation of the war, he warned members that interfering would be even more dangerous and would only bring suffering, death and destruction. He reminded that peace and security are not self-evident.
However, Stoltenberg praised Germany for its military and humanitarian support to Ukraine, reports the British BBC. ""Yesterday, defense ministers began to think about what we need to do to strengthen our defense and deterrence in the long run. This will mean increased investment in defense,"" he added.
Scholz said that Germany would strengthen its defense resources, thus ensuring that NATO would be able to fulfill its duties and mandate."

Some Slovenian politicians also reacted to his death, describing him as a friend of Slovenia and a visionary.","Erhard Busek died unexpectedly on Sunday, the Institute for the Danube Region and Central Europe, which he headed as chairman of the board, told the Austrian news agency APA. I would celebrate my 81st birthday on March 25th.
From 1991 to 1995, Busek was the leader of the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP). During this time, he was also vice-chancellor in the grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPÖ) and at the same time Minister of Science and Research, and since 1994 Minister of Education, according to the APA.
He was considered an expert on the situation in the Western Balkans, reports the Serbian news agency Tanjug. Since 1996, he has been the coordinator of the South East European Cooperation Initiative (SECI), and between 2000 and 2002 he was the Austrian government's envoy for EU enlargement. He was also the Special Coordinator of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe.
He advocated Slovenia and Croatia's membership in the EU and a greater role for the Union in the Western Balkans. As part of his work, he visited Slovenia several times.
During his visit to Slovenia in the role of coordinator of the Stability Pact in January 2005, he told STA that during a meeting with Prime Minister Janez Jansa he expressed the expectation that Slovenia, as an EU member, would continue to advocate for SE Europe.
Prime Minister Janša reacted to his death today, calling him a ""great statesman and friend of Slovenia"". ""Rest in peace, dear Erhard, we will never forget the affection for Slovenia in the most difficult times,"" he wrote.
The death also affected former Slovenian Prime Minister Lojze Peterle, who met the then Austrian vice-chancellor during Slovenia's independence efforts in the late 1980s, APA reports. ""We have lost a lot of personality in Austrian and European politics,"" Peterle told the APA. Busek ""was not arrogant and obsessed with power"", but always intellectually honest and ""visionary"". According to Peterlet, Busek also had a great awareness of Central Europe. ""He knew everything that was happening in the area,"" said Peterle, who last met him last year at a ceremony marking the 30th anniversary of Slovenia's independence in Vienna.
In December 2019, the President of the Republic Borut Pahor awarded Erhard Busk the Silver Order of Merit for his contribution to Slovenia's international recognition. Busek is ""an ardent defender of Slovenia from the difficult moments before and after independence, and on its path to European integration until today"", the President's Office emphasized at the award ceremony. The Silver Order of Merit is an expression of respect for Slovenia and gratitude for its rich and comprehensive creative work for the Slovenian nation and the Slovenian state, they explained. .
The news of his death resonated strongly in his People's Party, which he headed, as well as among Austrian politicians. Chancellor Karl Nehammer described him as a “great Austrian and an enthusiastic European” who was esteemed by many, regardless of party affiliation. Austrian Parliament Speaker Wolfgang Sobotka described him as a ""politician with attitude, a visionary and a pioneer""."

Outbreaks of infections have closed schools in Shanghai and halted public life in several cities in the northwest of the country. These are the viral versions of omicron and delta.","
Outbreaks of new coronavirus infections have already been reported in 19 Chinese provinces. A partial closure of public life was imposed today in the city of Jilin in the province of the same name in the northeast of the country, after the nearby Changchun, 9 million, was closed on Friday.
Since the outbreak of the pandemic, China has pursued a zero-tolerance policy towards covida-19, which includes prisons of public life, travel restrictions and mass testing in the event of an outbreak of infection.
This strict policy has been successful so far, but has recently been tested due to the highly transmissible coronavirus version of omicron and the large number of asymptomatic cases.
Six rounds of mass population testing have already been conducted in Jilin. More than 500 new cases of the infection have been discovered there today, local authorities said.
A ban on public life has also been imposed since last Thursday in the smaller towns of Siping and Dunhua in Jilin Province, and on March 1 in Hunchun near the border with Russia and North Korea. Three temporary hospitals for covid patients have also been set up in the city, China's Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday."

Ever since he took over as Uefa's first husband, who has as big a budget as Slovenia, he has been under attack all the time. Before the war in Ukraine, which stunned the world, Uefa had to save itself from the consequences of the crown, and before that to take it out of the field of corruption. During the Ukrainian war, billionaires, Real Madrid boss Perez, Juventus Agnelli and Barcelona Laporta, once again want to set up a Superleague project that he crushed in 48 hours a year ago, making his determination known around the world. Due to his directness, he also became a thorn in the side of the fifth Prime Minister Janez Janša. Is Aleksander Čeferin really the one who is pulling threads in Slovenian politics from the background?","Alexander Ceferin first explained on the show One on One that the war in Ukraine is a terrible humanitarian crisis. He told how Croatian footballer Dario Srna called him and told him that there were 47 Brazilian footballers, wives, parents, including children, including two newborns and 15 Italian coaches. Ceferin immediately called one of the footballers, the team leader, who said in tears that Ceferin was the only person to contact them in the last 48 hours. ""It was very shocking because I didn't know if it was in my power to be able to help them at all,"" Ceferin said. he knew if he would succeed. But the story touched him personally, on the other hand, he also believes that he must take responsibility if he fails to save the group. ""I think it's my job to at least help the football family anywhere, so I took it personally,"" he said, adding that he had to talk to certain influential people himself, because if I had ordered this to someone else, it wouldn't have happened. had such weights.
With friends in Ukraine who have stayed in the homeland, Ceferin is heard every day, even several times a day, as he feels it is right to offer them at least moral support, although it is not easy.
Ceferin, who received the highest state award a foreigner can receive from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last December, described Zelensky as a modest, intelligent man who is not a typical Eastern European leader. Ceferin also visited Russian leader Vladimir Putin and did not even imagine that he would start a war. A few days before the invasion began, Ceferin said, he told everyone that he did not think it was likely. ""It seemed to me that war in this way was practically impossible in the middle of Europe at the moment, but I was obviously wrong.""
Uefa also decided to terminate the contract with the Russian giant Gazprom, which seemed a clear decision. It took them a few days to legally check how they could withdraw from the contract, as there are clauses in the contract. But it was clear to Ceferin that they had to show some unity. Otherwise, they immediately received various calls from many politicians across Europe to do so. With this move, Uefa lost over one hundred million funds. “I was heartbroken that we had to sanction Russian athletes, whom I believe most disagree with this war,” he added.
Football is also politics
Regarding the decision of the British government to freeze the assets of Roman Abramovich, the oligarch of the Chelsea football club, and that fans can only watch matches for which they have already bought tickets but do not sell new tickets, Ceferin said that Chelsea will play normally at their competitions. However, Ceferin has also spoken to the President of Chelsea, who told him that he is already in talks with the British government, as this is the first decision, but he expects that they will be able to function normally. As Ceferin added, there is absolutely no reason to exclude Chelsea from the Champions League.
""If I were worried about being criticized, then I would do absolutely nothing,"" Ceferin said when asked if he feared criticism that Uefa was cooperating with Russian oligarchs, while British Prime Minister Johnson said he could not be safe. places for those who support Putin's attack on Ukraine. Ceferin also believes that their decisions are very timely and also very correct.
But football is also politics, as presidents also go to matches, and after the war, Putin will look at how someone acted. Did Ceferin count anything on all these measures, since it is an election year ahead of him, and he will also need the support of the Russian Football Association? According to the president of Uefa, he does not need Russian support, because, as he says, he has close to 100% support at Uefa. the right decision, even if the right decision would cost him his term. “I would never compromise on staying in office,” he added.
And as if the war in Ukraine is not enough, the idea of ​​a Super League has resurfaced. Ceferin is convinced that this is a dead project, but it seems that there are people living in a parallel world who are talking about this project. Namely, they were the first to register for the Champions League, but at the same time they say that they have their own league, says Čeferin, and continues that they proposed their nonsensical proposal for the first time in the middle of the epidemic and for the second time in the middle of the war. These people are extremely frivolous and I think they even see for themselves that the thing is not going to go through, but their ego is not giving them peace. They are used to getting everything they want in life, but this time they are not, he added.
Slovenian politics
Čeferin also spoke about Slovenian politics and politicians, but stressed that the most important thing is to go to the polls, because if you do not go to the polls, you have no right to complain, because we decide our own destiny. Sam does not support any particular party, nor does he support violence, disrespect, and hate speech. And he will definitely go to the polls.
Ceferin has not yet been officially received by any prime minister, although he has gathered members of the Uefa executive committee, only President Borut Pahor. Does he believe that under the new government there will be a change so that he can open the door to the largest multinationals, so that they can come and invest in Slovenia, which would raise the standard for the population as well? Ceferin believes it all depends on who will form the government. ""Some know everything themselves or work only with those they like and are subject to them… some are more open,"" he said, adding that it is necessary to wait, but in principle he is willing to help but does not feel affected. if that doesn't work."

The NSi president gave his opinion on sanctioning EU members who do not respect the rule of law, recognizing Palestine, (in) optimality of former government spokesman Jelko Kacin during the epidemic and comparing the US invasion of Iraq to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.","The full interview with Matej Tonin will be published on 24ur.com on Sunday.

1. Should the EU financially sanction countries that do not respect the rule of law?
Yes.
2 Can Marko Perkovič-Thompson have a concert in Slovenia?
No, because in his performances he developed themes and contents that our society - especially in relation to half-past history - finds it difficult to identify with.
3. Why does NSi not have any female ministers, but five ministers?
A case, a web of circumstances. NSi is very gender balanced with our current composition of the parliamentary group. We have also had a female president for a very long time, so it is difficult to blame our party for gender imbalance. However, we have always strived to make equality as great as possible.
4. Should Slovenia be legally committed to the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement?
Yes.
5. Should Slovenia recognize an independent Palestine?
Things are complicated and there is no single answer here. Recognition of Palestine is only pro forma, that would not solve the situation on the ground. In circumstances like this, I am not in favor of recognition, because that would not improve the situation of the Palestinians, at most it would make it worse.
6. Was Jelko Kacin a good vaccination coordinator and government communicator?
I believe that Jelko Kacin tried his best, but he was not optimal.
7. Could you participate in a government of which the Left would also be a part?
No.
8. Does Jaša Jenull deserve a fine of 34 thousand euros for reading the constitution at the protest in front of the National Assembly?
Yes, because it is a question of respect for the rule of law. Jaša Jenulla must be subject to the same standards as everyone else. And if we are all obliged to adhere to them, then Jaša Jenull must also adhere to them.
9. Did the police use disproportionate resources at the demonstrations on 5 October?
No. She used proportionate resources according to her assessment - at least that was her report - to prevent possible major riots or destruction of property.
10. Is there a difference between the American invasion of Iraq and the Russian invasion of Ukraine?
There is. The invasion of Ukraine was completely unprovoked, while the invasion of Iraq - at least in the basic, initial initiative - had a basis that then turned out to be untrue. They were said to be producing weapons of mass destruction. He later refuted the time of the American claim. In fact, Iraq was ruled by a dictator, and Ukraine is ruled by a democratically elected government, so there is a fundamental difference here.
Last week, SAB President Alenka Bratušek answered ten quick questions.
The full interview with Bratušek is available here:"

Restrictions lifted in Serbia,"China reports the largest daily increase in new coronavirus infections in the country since the first outbreak in Wuhan more than two years ago. The Chinese National Health Commission has confirmed 1,524 cases, of which about two-thirds are asymptomatic. In the city of Changchun in northeastern China, complete closure has been imposed due to hundreds of confirmed infections. In Serbia, meanwhile, clear certificates and all restrictions on indoor collection have been lifted.","As of today, obvious certificates have been lifted in Serbia, as well as all restrictions on the number of people indoors, Serbian media report. This means, among other things, that all cinemas and theaters can operate again as before the pandemic, and people no longer need any certificates to enter restaurants even in the evening.
The decision of the crisis headquarters follows the improvement of the epidemiological situation in the country. The daily number of new infections and deaths due to covid-19 is falling, and the situation in hospitals is normalizing.
As of today, only the recommendation for the use of protective masks indoors, seven-day quarantine and restrictions on international traffic remain valid in Serbia - more precisely, a mandatory PCT certificate (vaccinated, ill, tested) is required upon entry into Serbia.
China has the largest daily increase in infections since the beginning of the pandemic
A complete closure was imposed in the northeastern Chinese city of Changchun on Friday after hundreds of new coronavirus infections were discovered there. They have also introduced strict rules on leaving home, and all nine million residents will also be tested.
After the first outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020, China pursued a zero-tolerance policy on covida-19, and the authorities quickly took tough action. In the last two years, possible new outbreaks have been prevented mainly by mass testing and strict restrictions on public life.
However, since the highly contagious coronavirus version of omicron was first confirmed in China in January this year, health experts estimate that such a strict restrictive policy is no longer sustainable."

The left also wants to address this crisis with a new tax on empty flats and larger or more expensive real estate. ""While we are talking about how we lack housing and how expensive they are, some owners do not even put them up for rent,"" he pointed out. The current arrangement, according to Mesec, is causing such a hole that 175,000 empty flats are expected to be built in Slovenia.","According to Meš, housing policy has been unregulated in Slovenia for 30 years, since Jazbinšek's law. ""On the one hand, real estate is concentrated in the hands of a handful of people who buy it as investment and rent it out. According to real estate agents, these investment purchases are already over 30 percent, and the trend is only intensifying as they are afraid of inflation, they are investing money in real estate in order to be safe there, ""he said in a press release today.
According to the coordinator of the Left, real estate prices are rising, according to the coordinator of the Left, and the problem arises with people who need housing but cannot afford it because market prices have simply gone crazy. ""This is no longer a phenomenon limited to Ljubljana, we can now monitor it throughout Slovenia,"" he said.
The current arrangement, according to Mesec, is causing such a hole that 175,000 empty flats are expected to be built in Slovenia. ""In the Left, we have decided to tackle the crisis not only with the construction of public rental housing, which needs to be built 30,000, but also with a tax, namely a tax that would hit the owners of more and more real estate, and a tax that would specifically target owners of vacant properties. ""
Someone living in a property worth 250,000 euros and up to 120 square meters in size, he said, would pay nothing, but those who live in larger and more expensive real estate would pay, especially those who have vacant properties. According to Mesec, they would be taxed at a coefficient of 1.5 and would pay comparably more tax, which, according to him, would force them to rent out or sell these properties.
What does the bill on the tax on empty and large real estate bring?
The deputies of the Left are a bill on the tax on empty and large real estate, intended for the progressive taxation of empty flats and larger or. more expensive real estate already invested in the National Assembly. The proposed tax rates vary depending on the type and value of the property. For buildings, among which are dwellings, they are expected to amount to 0.1 to 1.5 percent. For apartments rented by the owner, they would increase by 50 percent, and for apartments that the owner neither rents out nor uses, by 150 percent.
For repaired and renovated residential houses or. housing and garages, tax rates would be reduced by 50 percent for a period of three years, provided that their value has increased by more than 50 percent due to repair or renovation; to a taxpayer with more than three family members with whom he resided in his own house or apartment in the year before the taxable year, the assessed tax would be reduced by 10 percent for the fourth and each subsequent family member.
According to the proposal, the tax rates for rest and recreation facilities range from 0.2 to 4.5 percent, and the tax rates for business premises from 0.15 to 3.3 percent. For business premises that are not used by the owner or rented out for business purposes, the tax rates on business premises would be increased by 50 percent."

He also announced that he would fully respect all the rules that Italy and the EU will impose on Russia.
Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto today announced its exit from all commercial relations with Russian customers. Rio Tinto did not specify a timeframe for completing this process, which could prove very demanding in light of the miner's high entanglement with Russian entities. In Australia, for example, Rio Tinto, in cooperation with the Russian aluminum giant Rusal, has one of the world's largest refineries for this metal, Queensland Alumina. Rusal owns a fifth of the company.
Japan's Mitsubishi Electric has stopped shipping its products to the Russian market, according to the Russian news agency Tass.

Japan's Sony, meanwhile, has stopped shipping its gaming consoles and games to Russia, and has shut down the Playstation Store in the country. “Sony Interactive Entertainment is joining the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” the company wrote.
According to the Japanese newspaper Nikkei, the supply of gaming consoles and related software to Russia was also interrupted by Nintendo.
The world's largest travel group, Germany's TUI, has revoked the rights to use the TUI brand from Russia's partner TUI Russia. The TUI Group sold its stake in TUI Russia last year, but allowed the Russian company to continue using the TUI name in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. This policy has changed in the light of the Russian war in Ukraine.
The uprising against Russia also comes from the ranks of hoteliers. The American hotel chains Hilton and Hyatt have announced that they will stop development activities and new investments in Russia due to the situation in Ukraine. ""We have made a decision to stop development investments and all new investments in Russia,"" Hyatt said. ""We will continue to monitor the operation of hotels in Russia, respecting all sanctions and US government directives in the hope of resolving the crisis,"" they added.
“We have closed our offices in Moscow and will provide work and pay for all affected members of our team,” the Hilton said. They, too, added that all expansion activities in this country will be stopped.

They talked about the situation in BiH and the strengthening of the EUFOR. The Serbian member of the presidency, Dodik, assured her that there were no plans for secession in BiH, but that internal political struggles were taking place. The Chief of the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina assessed that there is currently no major security crisis in the country and that the deployment of additional EUFOR forces is only of a preventive nature.","The West will insist on maintaining peace and stability in BiH, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock assured during her official visit to Sarajevo. After a meeting with Bosnia and Herzegovina's Foreign Minister Bisera Turkovic, the German foreign minister told a news conference that her arrival in the Western Balkans demonstrates the importance of working to maintain peace in Europe, which has been severely threatened by Russia's aggressive policies.
That is why it is all the more important to maintain peace in BiH, as well as to prevent any attempts to endanger the survival of this country. ""We must ensure peace in BiH and fight against all those who threaten it. We will not allow threats to peace,"" Baerbock said after the meeting.
She added that democratic and fair elections are necessary for every country, including BiH, where the electoral system needs to be improved. ""The new electoral law must not increase the problems in the country. It is also important that the elections take place on schedule in October,"" she said.
Turkovic called on her German counterpart to support stopping separatist tendencies in Republika Srpska, which she said were the biggest security threat to BiH. ""The escalation of the situation in Ukraine and the crisis in Europe have only complicated the situation in BiH,"" Turkovic said. She added that BiH's external borders were not threatened for the time being, but that the internal situation was leading to further destabilization.
Dodik: There are no plans for secession in BiH
After a meeting with the German foreign minister, Serbian member of the BiH presidency Milorad Dodik assured that there were no plans for secession in BiH.
""I told her that this is an important spin in the direction of making the situation in BiH unstable, which of course is not true. We talked about Euphoria, its role in supporting it all. Their security assessments should be more respected. , but not some misleading political propaganda tricks coming mainly from Sarajevo, ""Dodik said.
Baerbock assured that there was no movement in BiH related to the secession of the state. ""Internal political struggles and the demand for the constitutional status of the Republic of Slovenia are not secession,"" he said.
He also said that the future of Europe could not be built by dismantling a particular country. ""Thus, it is not possible to build BiH if the constitutional position of the Republika Srpska is not respected. I think we agree that a completely neutral legal analysis of the situation is made under German auspices, without political impurities and adding desires,"" Dodik said.
As he says, they did not discuss possible sanctions at the meeting. ""We did not talk about sanctions against me, then you know how much they are interested in that. We did not talk about sanctions against Russia, because the meeting, as said, was correct,"" he added.
After the meeting, the Bosniak member of the BiH presidency, Sefik Dzaferovic, emphasized that ""stronger German engagement in BiH and the Western Balkans"" can be expected in the future.
""This is a very important meeting for BiH. It was successful and constructive. Germany is a great friend of BiH. BiH would like to help it overcome the current crisis and continue on the European path, the path towards NATO and comprehensive reforms,"" ​​he said. He said at the meeting that the way out of the situation is the immediate unblocking of BiH institutions and the cessation of constant threats to the territorial integrity of BiH. He stressed that the Dayton Accords must be respected and that everyone wants the country to function.
Baerbock will also visit Pristina, Belgrade and Moldova in the coming days.
'Events in Ukraine cannot be compared to possible scenarios in BiH and the wider Balkans'
The security situation in BiH has been one of the hottest issues in the country for some time now, especially since EUFOR convoys arrived in the country. The Chief of the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces of BiH, Colonel General Senad Mašović, also spoke about this for the New Day. He emphasized that the presence of EUFOR and the strengthening of their units in BiH was welcome.
Asked if there are signs that the war in Ukraine could spill over into the Balkans and Bosnia and Herzegovina, he said: ""This is the question that has been asked most often lately. There are no realistic assumptions to compare events in Ukraine with possible scenarios in BiH and beyond in the Balkans. ""

He pointed out the fact that both NATO and EUFOR missions are present in BiH, which have clearly defined obligations in accordance with the Dayton Peace Agreement and the Berlin Plus Agreement. It is very clearly defined that the EU takes responsibility for maintaining the full spectrum of security in BiH and that it can count on NATO forces to strengthen and protect what is prescribed at the same time. We have extraordinary cooperation with EUFOR and NATO Sarajevo, ""he said.
In his opinion, it is unlikely that the conflict could escalate and spread to BiH. ""There is no major security crisis that could affect BiH. Of course, the internal problems we are facing have other dimensions and are not so much related to the BiH armed forces, but to political and other security structures,"" he added. .
""I think we need to be aware and understand that, given the experience so far and the war raging in Ukraine, the EU and NATO cannot and must not allow any other kind of security crisis in Europe in this situation. It is in our interest not to not only BiH, but also the EU and NATO, for their own security, stability and preservation of democratic values, which were achieved through hard work, ""Masovic explained.
He is convinced that the direct invasion of Ukraine surprised the international community, but that it has learned a lesson. ""What we see now in practice and what is happening, the decisions taken by the international community, is the fact that the international community is helping Ukraine financially and materially, by providing state-of-the-art equipment and resources, to protect its territory and stop aggression,"" he said. said the chief.
As he says, during the war in Ukraine, the European community learned a lot. ""Unfortunately, she has not learned from the war in BiH, she has learned very little from the war in BiH. Now that the future of Europe is directly threatened, she has learned to respond very quickly, promptly and appropriately. She is now ready to it responds much more sharply to the challenges facing the modern world, ""he concluded.
Croats in BiH are threatening to boycott the autumn elections
BiH is undoubtedly a deeply divided country, facing a period of instability ahead of the autumn elections. Namely, Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina are once again calling for changes in the electoral legislation and are threatening to boycott the autumn elections.
In accordance with the Dayton Agreement, which ended the war in BiH (1992-1995), the country is divided into two entities: the Republika Srpska and the Federation of BiH. The latter is made up of Croats and Bosniaks, but as the latter make up almost 70 percent of the population, this gives them a numerical advantage in elections and de facto control over who can be elected to represent Croats in the country's three-member presidency. This is also the reason for the growing dissatisfaction of Croats and their willingness to boycott the general elections in October.
""Either we will solve this problem with a peaceful departure or we will make the home - the country - more fit for life,"" former Croatian soldier Petar Vidic told AFP in Mostar. Croatian pensioner Sima Pehar said: ""Why should Croats be represented by someone who was not elected by Croats? This is not logical.""
Bosnian Croat parties in Mostar discussed further steps at a February conference and called for urgent reforms. They did not announce a general boycott. However, the leader of the HDZ in BiH, Dragan Covic, said that the election law should be changed so as to ensure the legitimate representation of all three constituent nations.
Croatian parties want a mechanism that would allow them to elect their representatives in the presidency and upper house of parliament, which is strongly opposed by Bosniak parties. Even the current Croatian representative in the presidency, Željko Komšić, who is actually supported by Bosniaks, is not in favor of this. He says ""the electoral law would be based on apartheid.""
Political analyst Zoran Krešić disagrees. ""I am convinced that if the law is not changed, the crisis will continue. This is bad for the whole of BiH and its Euro-Atlantic future, and it will also affect the people,"" he told AFP.
Dacic: Russia has vetoed a resolution on Srebrenica and should we impose sanctions on them now?
Serbian Parliament Speaker Ivica Dacic said that Serbia had responded in principle to the events in Ukraine and that they did not intend to impose sanctions on Russia. ""Not because we are afraid of Russia, but because it would harm Serbia,"" he told Serbian TV Happy.
""How would I feel if we did that? I called Lavrov 100 times for some questions, he told me that they would veto a resolution (on genocide) on Srebrenica and now we should impose sanctions on them. Wait ..., "" he said. He was outraged by a statement by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who said the Russians were attacking civilian targets. ""What they were doing was attacking civilian targets (in Serbia),"" he recalled of the 1999 bombing of Belgrade."

In his speech, Prime Minister Janša emphasized Pučnik's leading and connecting role at the time of Slovenia's independence. He compared his return from abroad to Slovenia at the time of independence to the return of Ukrainians from abroad to help defend Ukraine.","The Prime Minister Janez Janša recalled Jože Pučnik's statement announcing the results of the plebiscite on Slovenia's independence engraved on the monument: ""Yugoslavia is no more, now it is Slovenia."" We must repeat Pučnik's famous words today, he emphasized.
After the plebiscite on Slovenia's independence on 23 December 1990, there were many doubts about Slovenia's decision to become independent. At that time, Pučnik convened a meeting of the Demos government in Brdo, which was united in the decision for independence, explains Janša, who was the Minister of Defense in the then government.
According to him, despite the difficulty of coordinating a large number of parties in the first Demos government, Pučnik was not burdened with resentment. He fought for the right of the Slovenian nation to self-determination. ""I am glad that the main Slovenian airport bears his name and that streets and squares are named after him,"" the Prime Minister emphasized. He also expressed disappointment that the above did not apply to the capital Ljubljana.
He said that before arriving in Brdo near Kranj, he had received a call from the Australian Prime Minister asking him how the EU would act in the coming days and weeks. What will happen in Ukraine will also determine what will happen in the South Pacific and elsewhere in the world in terms of peace and respect for international law, Janša summed up the words of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
He recalled that many Ukrainians living in various European countries are returning to Ukraine these days to help defend it. ""Pučnik also came from a comfortable foreign country during the turbulent period of the Slovenian spring,"" he said.
Minister of Culture Vasko Simoniti also recalled Pučnik's famous sentence. According to Simoniti, Pučnik kept his faith in life, in today and tomorrow, with his fearlessness. He saw the future in Slovenia and was certainly one of its pillars, added the minister, who in his address also recalled his meetings with Pučnik.
The bust of Pučnik was unveiled by Prime Minister Janša and Gorazd Pučnik, son of Jože Pučnik. Members of the saxophone quartet of the police orchestra and poets Igor Pirkovič and Tone Kuntner performed in the cultural part.
On the occasion of the 90th anniversary of Pučnik's birth, the Slovenian Army Guard laid a wreath on Pučnik's grave on behalf of the President of the Republic Borut Pahor, the Office of the President of the Republic announced. They reminded that one of the halls of the Presidential Palace has been named after Pučnik since 2015."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/gospodarstvo/ifo-ekonomisti-zaradi-inflacije-pozivajo-k-visanju-obrestne-mere.html,Ifo: Economists are calling for an increase in interest rates,"Economists expect the average inflation rate in Germany to be 4.4 percent this year, according to a study by the Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research. Most respondents believe that raising interest rates is the most appropriate measure to combat inflation.","Participants in the survey, conducted by Ifo together with a group of economists from the German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, forecast inflation of 3.4% for Germany next year. The European Central Bank (ECB) is targeting inflation of two percent, so 75 percent of respondents said the bank should start fighting inflation immediately. According to 69 percent of the respondents, raising the interest rate is the most appropriate measure.
""Russia's war against Ukraine has further increased already high inflation,"" said Niklas Potrafke of Ifa. ""The ECB should now finally raise interest rates to help curb inflation,"" he said. When asked how high the key ECB interest rate should be at the end of 2022, respondents to the survey said that on average one percent. About 40 percent of respondents do not want to reopen targeted longer-term bank refinancing operations (TLTROs), and a similar proportion want to reduce or stop quantitative easing altogether.
Survey participants most often cited rising energy and commodity prices as the cause of inflation. Responses received after 24 February also mentioned a Russian attack on Ukraine. They also highlighted the problems associated with the covida-19 pandemic and barriers in supply chains. According to respondents, the reason for the rise in consumer prices is the loose monetary policy of the ECB."

As they pointed out at the press conference, the first program is becoming increasingly impoverished, the schedule is not right, and decisions on broadcasts and rallies surprise not only the public but also many employees.","In the assets of the journalists of the TVS news program, they demand full editorial and journalistic autonomy without any political pressure. They expect that any changes to the public broadcasting program are decided only by RTV and not on the initiative or in favor of political parties and influencers.
""As professional journalists, we strongly reject all pressures and malicious criticism. The writers of these intentionally distort the meaning of some comments. We urge the Program Council to perform its work independently and impartially, as required by the RTV Act,"" the press release said. . The activists also expect that all political parties will now and in the future refrain from any attempt to interfere in the activities of RTV Slovenia, which is in the service of the public, but not the state and politics. However, they demand from the management to strongly reject such attempts.
Journalists' Association: The appointment of the editor-in-chief is illegal
The Slovenian Journalists' Association (DNS) expressed support for the creators of the RTV Slovenia program and especially for the editorial board of the TV Slovenia Information Program in their efforts to preserve editorial independence and professional integrity.
They reminded of the last controversial move by the director general, which is the illegal appointment of Jadranka Rebernik, the editor-in-chief of the TV Slovenia Information Program. ""The director general did not respect the provisions of the RTV Slovenia Act, which stipulates that the editorial board has the right to nominate its candidate if the candidate for director of TV Slovenia does not receive the editorial board's support. who did not receive the support of the editorial board, was appointed outside the prescribed procedure, so her appointment is illegal, ""the journalists' association is convinced.
The fact that the process of appointing the editor-in-chief was illegal cannot be subsequently eliminated even by the program council's ruling on the candidate who received the support of the editorial board, the DNS says. ""Since the director general has already appointed the editor-in-chief with a decision, the appointment is illegal, so the tender must be repeated,"" they emphasize. of the RTV Slovenia Institute. Article 48 of the Statute stipulates that the reason for termination of the term of office of the Director General is if he does not act in accordance with the law and the statute, does not implement resolutions of the RTV Slovenia programming and supervisory board or acts contrary to them. RTV Slovenia causes serious damage to its work, neglects or negligently performs its tasks, so that serious disturbances occur or could occur in the performance of the activities of the RTV Slovenia Institute.
""We are convinced that the conditions for dismissal have been met, so we urge the program and supervisory board to start the dismissal procedure,"" the DNS said.
The provisions of media legislation that define the autonomy of the editorial board were adopted for situations where the editorial board opposes the appointment of an editor-in-chief, the association said. in this case policy."

However, she is critical of the rhetoric used by the government, especially its president Janez Janša, in times of crisis - both in the war in Ukraine and in the human crisis. She thinks she would be a good finance minister. Although he believes that the economic and public finance situation is not encouraging for the Slovenian economy, given the country's record indebtedness and the upcoming consequences of sanctions against Russia, he does not predict a tightening of the belt following Zujf's example ten years ago. I would not repeat the Commissioner's story - from today's perspective. She does not want to comment on whether she regrets her cooperation with Zoran Janković, with whom she entered state politics, or whether she would ever support Marjan Šarc as prime minister. When it comes to the blown-up Coalition of the Constitutional Arc and partners, he estimates that the Left is aware of what was done wrong in the previous term - also on their side.","The tenth day of the war is taking place in Ukraine. What did you personally, Alenka Bratušek, do to help the state - materially, financially or in some other way?
What is happening is a great tragedy and unacceptable. What our country has done at the moment is the only right path. I am glad that the EU is united. When I sat alone at the European table in 2014 and we were accepting sanctions against Russia, then because of Crimea, this unity was unfortunately not there. I tried to get in touch with Slovenian honorary consuls who are in Ukraine, but so far, unfortunately, I have not been successful. My task as a politician is to put what is happening on the table in the National Assembly or we support solutions. Thus, a declaration is already on the table, which I am sure I will adopt in the National Assembly and will also be supported by the SAB party.
What about you personally?
Personally, I have not yet helped humanitarianly or gone there. I don't know what will happen in the next few days.
How should the West act in the future?
The key, I think, is to stay united. The situation today is as it is. But what led to such a state of affairs? If we look at the behavior and actions of some other politicians in the EU, we may also be concerned. For example, Viktor Orban. In the last two years, Janez Janša has also used methods that are not the methods of the democratic world. Freedom of the media was put to the test. What RTVS and STA did to not recognize the judgments of the courts, that it was going to the rule of law - all these are things that years ago or. happening in Russia for many years. And we see where such things can lead. That is why I think it is crucial that as many people as possible go to the polls in France, Slovenia and Hungary in April and show that we are on a democratic path and a democratic Europe and that there is no room for such autocratic, arbitrary prime ministers.
I had in mind, above all, how the West should react militarily against Russia in the light of the war in Ukraine.
The sanctions adopted will have a serious impact on Russia, but we must also know that the EU countries will be affected. I myself am much more in favor of solving this problem at the table than in stepping up military activities. There is no war that does not end at the table. The only question is how many people die in between.
""If we do not help the Ukrainians today, we must start preparing for war on our own soil,"" said Prime Minister Janez Janša.
Janez Janša is a politician who uses too hard words in difficult situations. I remember in 2013, when our country was on the verge of bankruptcy. His words at the time were in the style of ""Raise your hands, admit that Slovenia cannot do it alone. Ask for help, in short, capitulate."" In difficult times, politicians need to reassure people, inspire confidence in them and show that we are reliable, and we must not further fuel their fears. That seems crucial to me. Janez Janša does everything differently.
A refugee wave will be inevitable. How would you tackle the refugee problem?
In any case, Slovenia is a country that always shows its compassion, and I believe that we will undoubtedly help this time as well. Of course, everything must be done to accommodate these people who are coming in the most suitable places and enable them to live as normally as possible in Slovenia. I cannot say whether the number of 200,000 refugees that Slovenia could accept from Ukraine, as mentioned by the Minister of the Interior Aleš Hojs, op. Cit., Is real or exaggerated. But I am convinced that Slovenia, if necessary, will be able and will be able to save so many people or help them.
Of course, it is inadmissible and ambiguous for the SAB to divide refugees into first- and second-class. Years ago, we saw the attitude towards other refugees who were also withdrawing from the war. And our position was the same at the time - people fleeing and retreating before the war need to be helped.
Would you remove the fence from the borders?
I do not think this is the most important issue for our country at the moment. We have a lot of things on the table, the health care system is in big trouble after the obvious crisis, which miraculously disappeared from the media news and our lives overnight. People in those two years were not given the diagnosis in time to be able to be treated. Some statistics show that about 30 percent of people in Slovenia are less likely to have cancer. This is by no means true, unfortunately some people will come to a diagnosis too late. My diagnosis is that we have things in Slovenia that we need to deal with now and immediately and that are more important than removing the fence at the border.
Won't you decide on that?
If it is not needed, there is no reason not to remove it. We were critical at the time. Above all, we should make such a fence - if necessary - that does not harm either animals or people. This barbed wire fence should therefore be removed immediately, if not already, and replaced with a panel one. But this is not the most important topic for our people at the moment.
Energy and food prices have risen sharply in the past, and life is now expected to be even more expensive. What should be done immediately to mitigate the economic consequences of the Ukrainian crisis?
Energy prices were rising even before the war, and it must be made clear that our government did not react. About a year ago, we liberalized the market for petroleum products. This was completely unnecessary because there is practically no competition in our country in this market. Before the war, petrol was 50 percent more expensive than before liberalization. Of course, then the prices of electricity and gas began to rise and one of the key points in the SAB's pre-election program is that Slovenia must become and remain energy independent.
We are doing relatively well with electricity, we get a lot of electricity or process it at home. In our program, we have an assurance that we will establish a state-owned company in the next government, which will be the third energy pillar and will build solar and wind power plants. This means providing more green energy. Of course, it will be necessary to find an agreement on when will be the right time to close TEŠ - certainly when we will be able to replace electricity with something else. I see a bigger problem with gas than with electricity, as we are 90 to 95% dependent on Russia. Otherwise, there are some import options via LNG terminals.
Talk about long-term or medium-term measures. What should we do immediately to mitigate the economic consequences of the Ukrainian crisis?
Our proposal was that the government should reduce or eliminate VAT and excise duties on this part of the energy bills. It is true that the consequences would be in the state budget because revenues would be low, but this is the only right way. Because what the government has done - to temporarily reduce the network fee - in the future has great consequences for our country, because we do not have a suitable network to put the green energy that households already obtain on their roofs into the grid. It would be much more correct to reduce VAT and excise duties and leave this money for the construction and development of the electricity network.
Bottom line - how well is Slovenia responding to the crisis, which is happening practically on our doorstep?
I honestly think that the formal steps taken by our country are the right ones. It is important that we are united in Europe. The downside of this government is the rhetoric - during the obvious crisis and also in this crisis. Our job is to solve things, but not in the style of “Enjoy while there’s still time”.
Whose mill is the crisis on the Slovenian political scene?
I wish I wasn’t at anyone’s mill. This is too great a tragedy for anyone to take advantage of to gain political points. It certainly seems that some want it.
European security policy is already changing rapidly, Sweden and Finland are approaching NATO, Germany will increase spending. What should be Slovenia's defense policy?
I believe that it is right that we are members of NATO, and that this is an advantage for our country. If you ask me about military procurement, we are not the ones who would just shout that it is not necessary. But we think we need or. it makes sense that military procurement is such that it can also be used for civilian purposes. We also called for the purchase of a helicopter, which could also be used in firefighting. In fact, soldiers need to be properly equipped.
But that still needs to be put on the table. Our country is indebted at this moment as it has never been before. The highest is our public debt, 40 billion euros, and the question is how much room for maneuver the next government will have for military procurement. Over the last two years, more than ten billion euros have been spent, only half of which has been spent on resolving the obvious crisis. The other half, five billion euros, was distributed for pre-election candies, which we will all pay dearly for in the country. So, despite some good indicators, the economic and fiscal situation is not encouraging.
Defense Minister Matej Tonin has put almost a billion-dollar bill under his roof. The next government will have to face it. execute it.
The Army Procurement Act is not the only thing the next government will have to deal with. They have also passed a law on two billion in healthcare investments, and we could go on and on. Responsible politics does not work by writing something into the law and then leaving it to the next government to enforce, saying that the next coalition should find out how and what.
Even the Long-Term Care Act, which is very important and should have been passed several years ago, simply requires the next government to introduce a new fiscal contribution in 2025. And this has been done by the government, which always says that the economy and the people need to be relieved. This government has left a lot of problems on the table that we will have to face in the next government.
That is why I think it is very important that in the next government, we have people who have the knowledge and experience to work in a difficult situation.
In what way will you stabilize public finances in the government if you participate in it?
Definitely in the long run. The situation is weak. Economic growth was favorable last year, but the government still had a deficit of just over three billion in the state budget. We probably don't know all the problems in the state budget at all. The next government will first have to familiarize itself with the budget and bring it to balance in the medium or long term.
Of course, it all depends on the situation in which Europe finds itself. The sanctions we are adopting today against Russia will undoubtedly affect the European and thus the Slovenian economy. The situation will be difficult, but I myself have once taken over the leadership of the government in this difficult economic situation in this country. At that time, we saved the country from bankruptcy, without threats and without intimidation. When we came to the government, there was only money left for two months and we didn’t know if we would be able to pay pensions or if we would be able to pay salaries to civil servants. But we rolled up our sleeves, started doing the steps we needed to, and we succeeded. On the other hand, at that time someone capitulated and called the troika to our country.
You nominated the country in the same way as the current government during the time of the government. Some accuse the debt at the expense of banks at the time, but this time it goes directly into the hands of citizens. How do you respond to that?
The banking hole was mostly created in the period 2004-2008. Why? Because the government, which at the time had direct influence over state-owned banks - the government appointed supervisors - allowed companies to take out unsecured loans, which they did not repay. This has put the banks and the country in huge trouble. So we didn’t really have a choice. We have no choice but to rehabilitate the banks, because otherwise the economy would collapse, people would be without jobs, without income, they would not have money for pensions.
The method of rehabilitation, ie with a bad bank, was also chosen by the Janša government in 2012. We then no longer had the opportunity to choose whether this was the right path or not, because we were on the verge of bankruptcy. We also gave people money then. Because if they did not do that, then people would be left without jobs, without salaries and without pensions. The only difference is that we rolled up our sleeves and worked, while Janez Janša and the SDS capitulated at that time and called the troika into the country. There was no choice, we were forced into it and in my opinion we did a good job, and this was also reflected in the immediate economic growth that has lasted to this day.
The mandate was marked by a coronavirus reality; According to the Ministry of Health, 6,926 patients with covid-19 had died in Slovenia by 2 March. Does this information shake you, do you feel responsible as a politician?
The obvious crisis undoubtedly marked two years of life in Slovenia, Europe and beyond. Another fact is that our government has not been the most successful in tackling the health crisis. In the first wave, a huge number of elderly people died, too many retirees, because they did not take timely action in nursing homes. In the second and third waves, the price was paid by young people because we had the longest closed schools.
The SAB was in opposition at the time, we were making a whole bunch of proposals that were not accepted. I have repeatedly asked the Prime Minister to convene all parliamentary parties to tell us in time what the situation is in the country. So I think that we, as an opposition party, did everything we could to make it easier for people to endure the crisis, but they simply did not hear us or did not want to hear and take us into account. Any preventable death is too much. In any case, the price of this unwise government policy was largely paid by the elderly or retirees.
Is now the right time to release obvious measures? Would you release them sooner?
It is encouraging that the health situation today or these days is relatively favorable - so at least experts say. The problem for this government was that it took action without regard to expert proposals. Perhaps these measures would be easier for people to take if they were backed up by professional decisions. Parents and children find it difficult to understand that someone who goes to a nightclub or disco does not need a protective mask, and children in schools still need it until Monday. It is difficult for people to understand that a measure applies to them and not to others - for example, when restaurants were closed and the minister had no problem arranging a meeting over food and drink without a mask in a restaurant.
So you are critical of combinations of measures. Is now the right time to relax?
If the medical situation allows it, the measures must of course be relaxed. I don't have all the information, I only have information from the media. I do not think that releasing measures at this time - if it is as I see and hear - is problematic.
In the past, you also bet a lot on healthcare, then with the program you focused more on pensions. Because healthcare is too big a bite, or because this move was a real opportunity to take on the votes of Desus?
Our program covers all areas, including healthcare. There are 15 key projects inside, I would put food self-sufficiency in the first place. I think it is very important for Slovenia, especially in these difficult times, to become independent. By the end, we must also legally enforce everyone's right to drinking water. I myself was the first to sign the amendment to the constitution.
Regarding the pensioners you mentioned, I would like to add two things: long-term care - the law has been passed, but it is completely inoperative. Here it will be necessary to change and clearly define the basket of services and determine the financial source. The other important thing is the demographic fund, which we believe is important, but by no means in the way that this government envisioned.
We would first accumulate the profits generated by state-owned companies for 20 or 25 years, so that we could then really take care of the stability of the pension fund. However, this money must be used exclusively for pensions, and not for other crumbs that this government wanted to bring to the Demographic Fund. In the demographic fund, we also want to raise funds from two of our greatest assets - water and wood.
If I mention only two things in the field of health care - the problem of family doctors is that there are too few of them and that they have the worst salaries in the health care system. An agency would be set up to carry out uniform public procurement in order to provide the same materials for all hospitals and public institutions. This would also lower the price and in some way reduce the possibility of corruption, more money would remain in healthcare, and that means more money for the people and services that people need.
However, you probably cannot deny that you want to take precedence over the retired electoral base, where Karl Erjavec was the undisputed ruler for many years.
Above all, we want to do a lot of things that need to be done for retirees. We do not promise the impossible, but we do what we promise. I will now touch on the project we have carried out this term - free public transport for pensioners. We also raised the retirement percentage.
In 2018, you told Večer: ""Don't sound complacent, but I am convinced that I would be an excellent finance minister with my knowledge and experience."" Do you want to become finance minister in the future government if you are part of it?
The fact is that due to the situation in which the world and Slovenia find themselves, knowledge and experience will be extremely important for the politicians who will lead our country in the next government. And the knowledge and experience I gained during my work at the Ministry of Finance or the management of the Budget Directorate for several years is invaluable for my work in politics. Because if you know the budget, you know virtually all the policies of the state.
I want Slovenia to return to the right path on 24 April so that as many people as possible take part in these elections. This government is certainly not pursuing a policy for which the people would give it a mandate.
Are you announcing a new law to balance public finances if you become finance minister?
In 2013, we saved the country in a really difficult situation, while also correcting certain things that the previous government wrote in the Zujf, such as the reduction of pensions. For the only time in independent Slovenia, pensions have been reduced. And despite the fact that we were on a very thin line between bankruptcy and success, the solution of the state, we returned these pensions to pensioners. In short, I am not announcing such a Zujf.
However, the belts will probably need to be tightened, at least in some areas. Where?
I don't have such a precise view of what they are doing at the Ministry of Finance now that I could not shake my sleeve. It is crucial that Slovenia has a solid and stable economy, because that alone means that we can ensure a strong welfare state and higher pensions.
Regarding the participation in Kul - once obviously did not work out. On what basis should voters believe you will this time?
For the SAB client, I can say that we are reliable, trustworthy. In Slovenia, however, there are and always will be coalition governments. This means that all partners in the coalition must be aware that we need to find the lowest common denominator for the good of the country. In the opposition, I can say that we have been talking a lot about the content in the last two years. We know where the differences are between us, but we are also aware and committed to finding the lowest common denominator.
Who has the greatest mandate potential among the Kulovs?
That is what the voters will say. Our agreement is that our proposal for prime minister will be the president or. the president who will receive the most votes in the election.
Would you support Marjan Šarc again as a candidate for prime minister?
We will talk about how the voters will decide after the elections.
How can the Kula equation be changed by the eventual victory of Robert Golob in the election, who smiles at him after the latest opinion polls?
I am convinced that our cooperation will be good. I can say this for myself because I know Mr Golob and I am convinced that our cooperation will be good and will definitely benefit the state and its citizens.
Why did your paths diverge - he was the vice-president of the SAB? You give the impression that you do not like his arrival on the political scene.
Everyone who chooses politics has the opportunity and the right to enter it freely. In 2014 or early 2015, he decided not to get involved in politics anymore and to focus entirely on the economy.
Without which party would Kul be the easiest to survive? The SAB is at the tail end of public opinion polls. The median gives you 3.2 percent, and that is not enough to exceed the parliamentary threshold.
If you look at the polls of the same company from four years ago, they predicted that we will not come to the National Assembly. Today, Mediana also announces the entry of the SAB into parliament. There is no doubt that we will be a parliamentary party.
What is the fear that the Left would fail after the elections, that program differences will prove insurmountable again?
You will have to ask them that. My impression today is that they are somehow aware of what has been done wrong during this term, including on their side.
How many members does SAB have? And why don’t you usually want to talk about numbers?
Because I don't think it's important for the public how many members we have. But I can say that we have about 500 more than a year ago. In short, the SAB party is growing, we have been joined by several hundred new members from a party that practically no longer exists.
In the last parliamentary elections, you failed to get into parliament. To what extent do you perceive non-election among deputies as a fiasco? However, you are the first name of the client.
The only reason for this is the electoral system. We want - and we have suggested - to change the electoral system and introduce a preferential vote. This would allow people in a particular constituency to vote for the candidate they want, not for the candidate you have to vote for if you want to vote for a particular party. Because in our system, the name of the candidate in the constituency is determined exclusively by the party and the voters have no choice.
Therefore, in our opinion, there is a certain apathy or dissatisfaction of voters, and voter turnout is declining from election to election. We are convinced that the interest of voters in the elections would be greater if they were given the opportunity to choose the person who will represent them in the National Assembly. We tried to change the law twice during this term, but we did not succeed.
On the other hand, people also need to be aware that elections are the day you decide your future. And if you don’t go to the polls, it’s like casting a vote for someone you wouldn’t vote for at all. Once again, I call for a repeat of the water referendum on turnout.
Politics is reduced to personality. You say that you are not a party of one person - why do you still insist on the name Alenka Bratušek's party?
We agreed to change the name after the election. But we will do it after the election because I don’t know if it would be wise to do it sooner.
In which direction?
I can't tell you now. We have some variants on the table, and we also want to give a political message with the name.
""Before you is a proposal that the Republic of Slovenia send three names to Brussels on my proposal - these are Mag. Tanja Fajon, Mr. Karl Erjavec and mag. Alenka Bratušek. ""What do these words remind you of?
At the time when we were deciding in 2014 who to send to Brussels for the Slovenian Commissioner, the choice seemed good. makes sense. If I look at it from today's perspective and with the experience I gained during that time, I would not repeat this story.
When was the last time you talked to Janković?
Since our paths with Janković became politically divided, we have not had any contact or relationship. We met for lunch three or four years ago and said a few words.
Are you sorry you worked with him?
In 2011, I decided to enter state politics precisely because, as a senior official, I found that my chances of changing the country for the better were limited. And if I want to help our country, if I want to change it for the better, I have to get involved in politics. PS was my first party, I had never been a member of any party before.
We achieved a good result and in 2013 took over the leadership of the government. I do not regret that I went into politics, that at that time, in 2013, I gathered courage, took over the leadership of the government and saved the country from bankruptcy.
And aren't you sorry that you worked with Janković?
I do not regret entering politics at that time. PS is the party I chose at the time.
How much do you bet on being a woman in politics?
I wish there were more women in Slovenian and world politics. Because in my opinion, women know how to solve difficult situations in a different way than men - we know how to listen, we know how to talk, maybe our egos are a bit smaller than men's. But I wouldn’t say I expect, because I’m a woman, an advantage over voters. I want voters to judge us mainly by what we have already done, how much of what we say we actually do, and to listen to what we say about the future. Whether the Slovenian voter really decides in this way is another question.

'It's not just one man's politics, it's party politics'","This time we asked ten quick questions about key social and political values ​​to SAB President Alenka Bratušek. Among other things, he says that the SAB is aware of the need to talk in politics. However, when asked whether he would have entered into a coalition with the SDS if it had not been led by Janez Janša, he answered that it was not possible to cooperate with a party operating on the same or similar to the way Vladimir Putin acted for many years. ""It's not just one-man policy, it's party politics.""","
The entire interview with Alenka Bratušek will be published on 24ur.com on Sunday.

1. Compulsory or voluntary vaccination?
Voluntarily.

2. Raising the contribution rate for compulsory health insurance?
Our demand is that when the supplementary health insurance is abolished, the money that runs out will be brought in with another contribution. So more money needs to be spent on healthcare. In what way, I find it hard to say.

3. Can doctors work in the public and private sectors?
Clear rules need to be set on how and what.

4. Is nuclear energy a green solution? Should Slovenia build the second JEK block?
Slovenia must first start with real green energy, namely the sun and wind. Regarding the second block of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant, we are advocating that people decide on this. Nuclear energy pollutes less than thermal power plants.

5. Is the state a good business owner?
When did it turn out not to. I am largely convinced that yes. And strategically, the state must remain the owner in many industries - infrastructure, the Port of Koper, etc.

6. Are you in favor of Ukraine's accession to the EU under the fast-track procedure?
This is a point where Europe is not so united. I think we need to give it a chance, but the question is whether membership is unconditional given the other conditions it is not currently meeting.

7. Is the parliamentary threshold too low?
I wouldn’t say it’s too low. I think at four percent it’s just right.

8. How high a pension do you promise?
We promise a pension that will allow people to spend their old age with dignity and, above all, to be able to pay for their care in a normal, standard room in a home for the elderly.

9. Which of the sweets of this government will you delete if you come to power?
For the most part, these candies will already be distributed and cannot be canceled.

10. Would we have entered into a coalition with the SDS if it had not been led by Janez Janša?
The SAB is aware of the need to talk in politics. But with a customer who works on the same or. a similar way to that of Vladimir Putin for many years cannot be cooperated. It’s not just one-man politics, it’s party politics.
Last week, the President of Concrete and the Minister of Economy Zdravko Počivalšek answered ten quick questions.
The full interview with Počivalšek is available here:"
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/putin-se-je-na-invazijo-pripravljal-ze-leta-zahod-pa-je-to-vedel.html,"'Putin has been preparing for the invasion for years, and the West knew it'","According to philosopher Slavoj Žižek, both Western countries and Russia are responsible for the crisis in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin had been preparing for the invasion for years, and the West knew it, he warned. He agreed with the allegations that Putin was a war criminal, but wondered if we had really noticed this only now. ""Wasn't he a war criminal when the Russian air force bombed the city of Aleppo in Syria, and much more brutally than they are now bombing Kyiv?""","In Maribor, where he addressed the congress participants of the Left Party, Slavoj Žižek recalled the period of tsarist Russia, in which Ukrainian national identity was banned. It was not until the first decade of the Soviet Union that Ukrainians were supposed to fully develop their national identity and gain dictionaries and their own literature. According to Žižek, Putin's policy means a return to tsarist Russia.
""Putin is not only a conservative nationalist, but even worse, as he elevated Ivan Ilyin, a political theologian who defended his basic version of fascism a hundred years ago, to his national philosopher,"" Zizek said. Ilyin is supposed to imagine democracy in such a way that people vote in it only to confirm their support for their leader. Their voices do not legitimize the leader. Thus, democracy has been at work in Russia for the past decade, and it is no wonder that Putin has become popular among modern-day populist politicians, especially in the United States, he added.
When Putin talks about denazification, we need to remember that this is the same Putin who for years supported Marine Le Pen in France, the League and Salvini in Italy, the Alternative for Germany in Germany and even Orban in Hungary. He showed remarkable understanding for Putin, ""he warned.
He warns that Russia today is not returning to the Cold War with a set of clear rules that both sides are supposed to follow, but something much crazier is happening. A period of warm peace has arrived. ""We are in a period when peace means a constant hybrid war and armed interventions have been declared peaceful humanitarian missions against genocide. How many times have we heard this phrase from Western powers, and today it was a bit too late to internalize it by the Russians,"" he said.
Žižek sees the only possibility of a successful revolt against Putin in the fact that we all look critically at ourselves. He recalled that the West was pushing Russia into fascism, citing US economic proposals that destroyed Russia's economy in the 1990s under Boris Yeltsin and paved the way for Putin.
He agreed with the allegations that Putin was a war criminal, but wondered if we had really noticed this only now. ""Wasn't he a war criminal when the Russian air force bombed the city of Aleppo in Syria, and much more brutally than they are now bombing Kyiv?"" he said.
""Remember that Ukraine is the poorest of all post-Soviet countries. Even if - hopefully - Ukrainians win, their successful defense will be a moment of truth for them. They will be forced to accept the bitter truth that it is not enough to capture the West and that Western liberal democracy is deep crisis, ""Žižek added.
We need to save Europe, but what kind of Europe, he wondered. ""If a Europe that does not tolerate non-white refugees and excludes the uncivilized wins, then we do not need Russia to destroy us - we will do it ourselves,"" he said."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/mesec-levica-je-orodje-s-katerim-poskusamo-svet-spreminjati-na-bolje.html,Moon: The left is a tool we use to try to change the world for the better,"The coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec, said at the party's congress that the Left is a tool with which they are trying to change the world around us for the better. At the same time, he stated that he understands those who expected more from them, but estimates that they have achieved a lot in terms of the number of deputies in the National Assembly. In the elections, they will also bet that the country will get a government with the Left.","As Luka Mesec pointed out in his pre-election address to party members at the fifth regular congress of the Left, they have been trying to be ""at least a patch on the wounds inflicted by time"" with the party in the last eight years since they crossed the parliamentary threshold.
He is convinced that the Left has helped during this time that the apocalypses that are looming around us have been a little more bearable and have affected us less than they could have us. In doing so, the Moon highlighted some of the party’s accomplishments. As he says, the Left has been on the side of employees, students, retirees and the unemployed for eight years. Among other things, he pointed out the increase in the minimum wage, the increase in pensions and social assistance, and the closure of shops on Sunday.
Among the achievements of the expiring mandate, the Month also highlighted the commitment to the victims of austerity measures, the fight against incitement against minorities and the vulnerable, and the commitment to a green policy.
According to him, the party has remained consistent for eight years, so, as he says, he is proud that the party does not have any serious scandals and cases of corruption behind it. ""Politics is dirty, they say. But it will be difficult for them to show where the Left is dirty,"" said Mesec, who claims that they will continue to do so in the future.
However, as he emphasized, Slovenia now faces new, bigger challenges. He is convinced that in the elections on April 24 we will decide what kind of country we want to live in. According to him, two things will be important, namely how many votes the bloc of the center and the Left will get against Janša and his satellites, and how many votes the Left will get within this bloc.
According to him, the latter will affect whether we get a government in the future that will not see the promises as dead letters on paper and will dare to bite into the great crises of our time. ""Our bet is clear; we are going to the elections to defeat the right and we are going to the elections to win the government with the Left,"" Mesec stressed. In his speech, the coordinator of the Left also touched on the key program points of the party.
In a statement at the end of the open part of the congress, Mesec also announced that they would strive to achieve a 30 percent better result in the elections than in the last parliamentary elections. Namely, the latter brought them nine parliamentary seats, and after the transfer of deputies Franc Trček and Željko Cigler to the SD, the Left ends the current convocation of the National Assembly with seven deputies.
At today's congress, they also presented the candidates who will run on the party's list in the parliamentary elections. Along with the party's coordinator, who will run for office in the Ljubljana Center constituency, all current Left MPs will run on the list, with the exception of Violeta Tomić, who left the party in January. and Nataša Sukič. They will repeat their candidacies in the units that have already won a parliamentary seat in the last parliamentary elections. Among the candidates on the party's list are some prominent names from various spheres of society, including anthropologist Svetlana Slapšak, psychologist and former MP Metka Mencin Čeplak, former president Milan Rejc, archaeologist and longtime gender equality activist Tatjana Greif and Kosovel Home director Nina Ukmar.
At the forefront of the electoral agenda are solutions to the crisis of capitalism, climate and democracy
The election program for the parliamentary elections has collected solutions on more than 100 pages that respond to the crisis of capitalism, the crisis of climate and the crisis of democracy. Among other things, the congress highlighted measures in the fields of social affairs, climate, culture and media, as well as foreign policy.
Among other things, the program advocates a tailor-made economy, announcing the adoption of a national development strategy. In the field of economy, measures include strengthening the state in the banking sector, a new strategy for managing the country's capital investments and higher funding for science, research and education, which would account for two percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
They also announce a fight for decent work, while promising to reduce working hours, immediately raise the minimum wage to at least 815 euros, which will be gradually increased to 1,000 euros. They intend to eliminate precarious work and are advocating the abolition of private student services and the transfer of their activities to the employment service. Concessions obtained by student services would be redirected to the scholarship fund.
In the field of economic democracy, which they advocate, the Left proposes the participation of workers in the management and adoption of the law on the participation of workers in ownership, as well as the creation of a public fund for economic democracy.
The program will also focus on the welfare state, ""against poverty and capitalist exploitation"". They also point out the restoration of the importance of social work, family policy based on social criteria and pensions for a safe old age.
They emphasize equal opportunities for all and the infrastructure of solidarity. In this context, they promise more budgetary funding for public health, the elimination of queues in health care, a clear separation of the work of doctors in the public and private sectors, and the inclusion of all residents in compulsory health insurance. At the same time, the Left would pass a new law on long-term care and build new public homes for the elderly.
One of the priorities of the program is to solve the housing problem by building 30,000 public rental apartments by 2030, introducing a progressive real estate tax and regulating the rental market.
In response to the climate crisis, they are announcing the fight against global warming, energy transition and a clear climate tax policy.
In the field of education, they will advocate for separate public and private education, free kindergarten, the abolition of all forms of tuition fees in the field of higher education, the increase of scholarships and the increase of funds for adult education.
They promise to launch culture after the covida-19 epidemic, transparent governance, accessibility and investing incentives for culture and the arts. Among other things, they consider the limitation of the influence of political power on the media and the depoliticization and long-term development of Radio Television of Slovenia to be important.
They also pay attention to the challenges of digitalisation, sustainable and balanced spatial development, efficient and accessible public passenger transport, sports and agricultural policy.
Last but not least, they also advocate a sovereign and well-thought-out foreign policy, the peaceful coexistence of nations and nuclear disarmament, demilitarization and withdrawal from NATO."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/pirc-musarjeva-ales-hojs-je-prvak-v-izbiri-neprimernih-besed.html,Pirc Musarjeva: Aleš Hojs is a champion in choosing inappropriate words,"She went down in history as the first Slovenian lawyer to represent US First Lady Melanie Trump. She described the government of Janša's government with decrees during the corona crisis as legal hooliganism. It always raises its voice when it comes to the rights of women and minorities. She is a doctor of law and says that Slovenians often fight for the shadow of a donkey. Former journalist and presenter and also a passionate motorcycle enthusiast. Few people know that she was a national champion in bowling 11 times. She is a sharp critic of hate speech, which the corona crisis has only intensified. It is at the forefront of measuring the popularity of new political faces. Is she even interested in politics? The guest on the show One on One was Nataša Pirc Musar.","How did Melania Trump even get to her law firm? Natasha Pirc Musar explains that she received a call from one of the most eminent American lawyers in the field of freedom of expression and invasion of privacy, Charles Harder, with the question: ""Natasha, would you be on the team for Mrs. Melanie Trump?"" He believes this did not happen by accident; she is convinced that her American colleagues conducted a detailed survey of who to choose in Slovenia. She is very organized and precise, she knows very well what she wants, she is hurt by injustices, she sums up her impressions of Melania Trump. In Slovenia, we were not aware enough that being the first lady of the USA is a serious profession, a serious commitment. Her parents are warm people she has met several times.
She also spoke with the leader Uroš Slak about the situation of women. Women do not want advantage, they just want equality. Personally, she does not have the experience that in the past it would be harder for her to get to the positions she held because she is a woman. However, he estimates that women are more skeptical about their knowledge.
She is not interested in entering politics, she will remain a critical observer of society
Is she interested in entering politics? ""I'd rather not,"" he replies. She says she is a critical observer of society. She is hurt by things that are unjust, and as a lawyer, especially things that destroy the rule of law. He hopes that the view of Slovenian politics on the rule of law will change. “What is happening to us now is poison to the rule of law,” he points out. What about new faces in politics? ""I like Robert Golob.""
They also touched on her criticism of the government as it took action during the epidemic. Her words that it was ""legal hooliganism"" are difficult. She nods to this, but explains that she uttered them after careful consideration. ""Legal hooliganism is to deny the system, the structure of the rule of law."" Not only does politics not listen to legal experts, epidemiologists do not either. ""Legal hooliganism has gone in the direction of adopting unconstitutional decrees, while only a few basic knowledge of constitutional law should be clear to any politician so that human rights can be encroached upon by law,"" he explains. ""To rule by decrees is the negation of the rule of law.""
He misses a culture of dialogue in politics. He notices a negative campaign, especially in the pre-election period. According to her, rude communication between politicians is most often used by Aleš Hojs. ""He's a champion at choosing inappropriate words."" She is often disappointed with Prime Minister Janez Janša. I wish everyone would inhale three times before uttering insults. However, he adds that we also hear inappropriate words in the extreme left position.
She herself has been the target of threats in the past, but she has not backed down. He says, ""It's hard for me to put on a muzzle. I'm honest in what I do.""
How does he view the role of the President of the country? He believes that President Borut Pahor is not taking his position responsibly and seriously enough. He should appear several times, but he is also able to compromise on the price of human rights. You should have your own opinion on every thing.
She also spoke about the ONA VE association, which aims to increase the representation of women in the media and at public events to 40%. This goal is not easy, he points out.
And finally about bowling, which he talks about as a filter and an oasis.
More on the One on One show on Voyo."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/nicesar-v-zivljenju-ne-obzalujem-za-vse-kar-sem-napacnega-storil-sem-placal.html,'I don't regret anything in my life. I paid for everything I did wrong ',"From a rebellious young man, he transformed into a respected lawyer, from a breaker who drank and spent nights behind bars, to an abstinent who did not even put a liqueur candy in his mouth for 40 years. He has been going to the same gym for 18 years, visiting more than a hundred countries and staring into the eyes of murderers, yet he never feared for his life. Because he is considered a lawyer who does everything he can for his client and what the law allows, he was described as unethical, indecent, mafia. The case of Perić, to whom he dedicated a third of his career, still haunts him.","Dr. Peter Čeferin will turn 60 next month, has been a lawyer for 55 years and still advises those in need every day. As he says, due to the nature of his work, he was not bored for a single day of his life. We talked to him about his career, current affairs and private life.
Dr. Ceferin, we are talking in the days when your son Alexander helped football players in Ukraine to safety, the Champions League final decided to move from St. Petersburg, Uefa terminated his contract with Russian Gazprom. These are great moves of a great man, you might say. He has proven how determined he is several times, including last year when he announced the establishment of the Super League. Does Alexander consult with you about such decisions, asking you for advice?
We have always been a very close-knit family. I monitor the life and work of all three children and support them. Of course, we also consult on some issues. However, there are decisions that do not allow consultation and which each decision-maker must make on his own and immediately.
It is no secret that many people want to see him in politics, but he himself persistently refuses to do so. What do you think about that?
I am convinced that Alexander's position in Europe and the world is more beneficial for Slovenia. He knows most of the leading politicians and businessmen in Europe and the world personally. These connections could be - of course with the appropriate Slovenian response - extremely important for our country in the economic, political, cultural and other fields.
You never wanted to be political. Now maybe you can trust us who you will vote for in the April elections? Or at least, what would you like more or less in the future?
The answer depends on what we mean by ""political determination"". I myself am not a member of any political party, but I was a member of the first state council in the new country. As a state councilor, I represented the interests of individual independent professions, such as lawyers, artists, translators, architects, farmers, etc. In the fifty-five years of practicing law, I mostly practiced criminal law, constitutional law and human (personal) law. Prior to Slovenia's independence, I was a member of the Council for the Protection of Human Rights, I defended the accused in political trials, I joined the defense of the four before a military court, etc. I am currently a member of the Whistleblower Protection Committee and I also pro bono help people who turn to me for human rights violations. Otherwise, criminal proceedings are, by definition, a conflict between an enormously stronger state, which has a monopoly on physical violence, and a weak individual. The only bumper between the two unequal opponents is a lawyer. Therefore, by the nature of his profession, a criminal defender is in principle an opponent of any regime, or at least a critic of it. I will continue my professional and life orientation. I am and will continue to stand for democracy, the protection of human rights, the rule of law, the rule of law, the independence of the various branches of government and respectful relations.
You will be 84 years old in June, you are the lawyer with the longest career in the country. How has the legal profession changed over time?
Regarding the role and position of a lawyer, I distinguish three different periods. In the first period, a lawyer in criminal proceedings did not have the power required by the Constitution and the law. In some cases, when the client and I waited in front of the courtroom for the main hearing to begin, the then public prosecutor was often in the judge's room, where they coordinated the indictment so that he was fit for trial. So I walked into the judge's room and said that the prosecutor should go out according to the equality of weapons or I would go inside with them. They stared at me for a while, then the prosecutor went out. In the second period, the position of the defense changed significantly. The lawyers were well prepared, praised by the public and the media, and all criticism was directed at other judicial bodies. As a result of acquittals in some high-profile cases, the media reported that both the police and the prosecution and courts were incompetent. In the third period, when t. i. tycoons and politicians, the media and the public demanded their immediate punishment, and lawyers were targeted for delaying proceedings, causing statutes of limitations, and so on. Today, the situation is changing due to some high-profile Supreme Court rulings.
How active are you in law? Do you find it difficult to hand over cases to your colleagues?
Next month I will complete 60 years of service and I am a lawyer for 55 years. I receive letters from different places every day by post or e-mail. Individuals want legal or even purely life advice. If at all possible, I answer everyone. However, if someone needs a representative or advocate in a specific court case, I arrange a meeting with our lawyer who deals with the relevant legal field. Individual libraries also invite me to various lectures, especially on my books, in which I discuss the legal profession and justice in general.
It is clear from your writing that as a young man you drank a lot, defied everything, fought, even slept some night behind bars. What 'sobered' you, directed you to the right path?
When my first son Rok was born, I stopped drinking and fighting. I completely gave up alcohol. I started working 12 hours a day and for 40 years I didn't even put a liqueur candy in my mouth. On the other hand, my association with people from the social bottom at the time was useful. I became aware of all the human misery and began to understand the plight of many people.
You have been defending Ivan Perić for 20 years, and for free. Why are you so firmly convinced that he is innocent? Is this the only case that still haunts you?
Of course, I am also haunted by many other things, but I have dedicated a third of my professional life to the Perić case. From the very beginning, I was convinced that barely twenty-year-old Ivan, a spoiled young man with no education or profession, his mother's pet, who was discharged from military service as incompetent, would not be able to commit triple murder in complete darkness and in another country. Murder that could only be committed by a professional or several professionals.
Everything our interlocutor said about the Perić case will be published in a separate article, which will be published in the coming days.

You are considered a lawyer who does everything he can for his client and what the law allows. But in the Makoter case, when you advised your client to revoke your power of attorney, you were accused of acting unethically. Do you still think you did the right thing? In your opinion, does the goal justify all means?
The lady, who was charged with ordering the murder of her husband and the bombing of a police station, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. As she was in custody, her son came to our office and my Alexander, by extraordinary remedy, obtained that this judgment be set aside. Our party, however, was still in custody. She was in a desperate psychophysical state. Her body weight was 40 pounds. In the new trial, Aleksandar and I made every effort to lift our detention so that our party could recover physically and mentally and at the same time be able to gather evidence for its defense. The law stipulates that the court must lift detention if it is unable to render a verdict within two years of the indictment being filed. Only a few days were left until the expiration of this two-year period, and Aleksandar and I suggested that she revoke our authorization. As a trial without a lawyer was no longer admissible and a potential ex-officio defense attorney would not have enough time to prepare for defense by the end of the two-year period, the lady, sentenced to thirty years in prison, was recently released. She hired a new lawyer and was acquitted after the end of the new evidentiary proceedings. If Aleksandar and I hadn't suggested it to her, she would now be serving a 30-year prison sentence (like Ivan Perić). Now let us ask ourselves: Is the lawyer obliged to inform the client of all the legal possibilities that facilitate his situation? Or should she keep such a legal provision secret? Which lawyer's conduct is ethical?
Unethical, fearless, even a mafia lawyer told you. The title of your biography, written by Tadej Golob, is Indecent Lawyer. Do you consider yourself obscene? What kind of lawyer are you actually?
When I decided to become a lawyer, I took into account that not everyone will like me. When I returned from the last major political process in Kosovo before the break-up of Yugoslavia, everyone in Slovenia applauded me. All the new political parties have invited me to run on their lists for a seat in the new National Assembly. When I started defending the first Slovenian capitalist, Sandi Grubelič, who sold cars on lease, they declared me a mafia lawyer and called me ""Grubelič's consigliere"". When I took over the defense of the alleged human smuggler, Josip Lončarič, and some others, they even wrote that I was ""the number one enemy of the state"". Today, I am an ""indecent lawyer"" because I told the party Milica Makoter that the law says that a man who has not been able to be convicted within two years of the indictment must be released from custody. I wonder what nickname they will give me tomorrow.
Have you ever really feared for your life, given who you've defended in your career?
No.
But is there a person you would reject and would not want to defend? What, for example, could we not do for any money?
My position is - according to the definition of criminal procedure I gave in the introduction - that a lawyer is obliged to accept each party in representation or defense. He must not accept a party in only one case: if his attitude towards the party or his case is so negative that his defense may be weaker as a result.
Have you ever turned someone down for that reason?
Never.
Are you sorry for anyone or anything? Would you do something different now - with all the experience you have?
I do not regret anything I have done in my life. I paid for everything I did wrong. One way or another.
You are responsible for many changes in this area, including the article in the then-valid Police Act, according to which suspects acquired the right to the assistance of a lawyer at the first contact with the Police, and not only at the beginning of criminal proceedings. You were ranked among the ten most influential lawyers in Slovenia, the Bar Association of Slovenia awarded you the highest recognition for your life's work, last year you were named an honorary citizen of Ljubljana… What are you most proud of?
I am happy to be recognized by colleagues for their life's work. The awarding of the title ""honorary citizen of the capital city of Ljubljana"" means the most to me. This title has been awarded since 1809 and the fact that I am among the personalities on this list is my greatest honor.
I read that you advise push-ups to your clients who are detained or serving a sentence. You yourself have been involved in sports all your life, among other things you are a master of karate. What are you doing now to keep a healthy mind in a healthy body?
When a person is taken into custody, his decision-making about anything is very limited. Therefore, I advise clients who detain or imprison them to do something that is not commanded to them, that does not depend on the will of others, and that is not prescribed. He also squats. Until a few years ago, I practiced karate. I have been training in the fitness club of Mrs. Sonja Poljanšek Škrabec for 18 years, with the same personal trainer Simon. I play golf at least once a week.
Supposedly you’ve only been on sick leave once in your entire career?
Twice. One time I had legionnaires ’disease and the second time I had spinal surgery.
You also travel a lot. How many countries have you already visited and what stuck in your memory the most?
With my now twenty-year-old wife Ana, and later with my partner Rio, I visited over a hundred countries. I found something wonderful in every corner of the world. At this point, it’s hard to say what stuck in my memory the most. In fact, traveling is at least one more college for me.
We started with the kids, and we end with them. Did they ever say to you: Father, is it time for you to retire?
That we are a very close-knit family, I said in the introduction. My children - if I start with the youngest - Petra, Aleksander and Rok, are against my retirement. On the contrary, they encourage me to be active in all areas."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/ukrajinska-vojska-pridrzala-opozicijskega-poslanca.html,The Ukrainian army detained an opposition MP. He was supposed to photograph military positions,"While the eyes are on the areas where fighting and the international community are taking place, political purges are being carried out in the hinterland of the Ukrainian state. Some say it is about removing traitors and limiting their influence, others that it is a pogrom against the Ukrainian opposition. Ukrainian forces thus detained Verkhovna Rada deputy Nestor Šufrič. A few days ago, Zelensky replaced the governor of Odessa and appointed former commander of the Aidar battalion, Maxim Marchenko, to his position, whom Russia accuses of links with neo-Nazis.","According to The Kyiv Independent, Nestor Šufrič was detained by soldiers of the 206th Territorial Defense Battalion of the Ukrainian Army. ""Šufrič approached the checkpoint, got out of the car and started taking photos. That's why we detained him,"" the army explained to the Ukrainian website. Šufrič belongs to the Platforma party, which is known for its pro-Moscow views.
A video of his arrest has also surfaced online:
- ""You said we had to withdraw the army from the east,"" says a soldier of the 206th Battalion to Šufrič.
- ""I said that the war must end and that the boys must return home,"" the MP replies.
- ""How do you say the war has to end? You said we have to stop firing and withdraw the army!""
- ""I didn't ...""
- ""Yes, you are."" This is followed by some insults.
A few days before the invasion, Šufrič was a guest on a television show, where he did not want to condemn Vladimir Putin and pointed out that his party is the second strongest in the country. This infuriated journalist Yuri Butusov, who branded the MP a traitor and physically assaulted him. A fight broke out, and with the help of other guests - former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and former President Petro Prosenko - they managed to calm the journalist and politicians down. Šufrič then left the studio for a while, but when he returned, he told the journalist that he was ""an ordinary provocateur"". Butusov, however, said Shufrich ""is involved in spreading Russian propaganda in Ukraine.""
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, made another political change this week, ousting Odessa Governor Sergei Grinevetsky, who is said to be in favor of reaching an agreement with the Russians. He was replaced by Maksim Marchenko, a former commander of the Aidar Battalion. The military unit, which was later reformed and incorporated into the Ukrainian army, is currently said to number several hundred members and is said to be responsible for several war crimes, including kidnappings, extortion, abuse and possible executions, according to Amnesty International. Russia draws attention to the neo-Nazi symbolism used by members of the battalion."

In doing so, they overturned the original decision to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete as neutral athletes at the Paralympic Games. The opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games will be on Friday, the competition program will start a day later. It is one of many sanctions against athletes from Russia and Belarus for military aggression against Ukraine.","The IPC initially decided that athletes from Russia and Belarus would be able to compete in Beijing, but the bots would be considered neutral, which would mean that they would not compete under their own flag and would not be included in the medal standings. However, at today's extraordinary session, after pressure from many member states, which announced a boycott of the Games if Russians and Belarusians are not excluded, they finally decided not to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in the upcoming Paralympic Games.
""Several national Paralympic committees have threatened to boycott the performance. In addition, the situation in the Olympic Village has worsened and it was necessary to ensure the safety of participants,"" the IPC said in an explanation of the change in the original decision.
""At the IPC, we firmly believe in the principle that sport and politics should not mix. The war has also moved to the Games and behind the curtain, many countries are interfering in the Paralympic Games,"" wrote IPC President Andrew Parsons.
""In addition, the rapid deterioration of the situation has pushed us into a unique and impossible position so close to the start of the Games. Many delegations have been in contact with us in the last 12 hours. Talks have been very open,"" Parsons said. a firm decision not to take part in the Games if Russians and Belarusians are allowed to play.
Parsons also pointed out that the situation in the Olympic Village was getting worse and endangered the safety of Paralympians. Also for security reasons, they therefore decided to exclude Russians and Belarusians.
""Parasports from limited countries, we are sorry that you are affected by the decisions of your governments last week that violated the Olympic Truce. You are victims of the actions of your governments,"" the IPC president said.
By attacking Ukraine, Russia has violated the Olympic ceasefire, which should last from February 4 - a week before the start of the Olympic Games - until March 21, a week after the Beijing Paralympics."

He has not yet revealed the details, but in the current geopolitical situation he is in favor of changes in energy, defense and foreign policy. I would also remove the fence on the border with Croatia.","At today's press conference, Robert Golob announced that all candidates for the parliamentary elections and the entire program will be presented at the convention on 19 March. According to him, more than 60 experts from various fields are working on it today. Some of them will also be on the candidate list of the Freedom Movement, and most of them, according to him, are ready to join the executive branch of government later. “Otherwise, we don’t want to tire the public with 200-page documents until it’s topical,” he said.
He added that some candidates have already revealed themselves to the public, while others do not want to do so yet. ""Today, some of us have to hide because of the situation we are in and we must not show ourselves to the public because otherwise we would suffer sanctions. Sadly, we have such a democracy at the moment,"" he added.
The movement will not be associated with any other party before the elections, as they would not have an influence on the choice of candidates and would not know what and whose interests these deputies would represent. As he pointed out, they are very thorough in the movement in checking candidates. According to him, they will not have pre-election agreements with the KUL parties on the division of power after the elections.
Regarding Ukraine: Slovenia has the most to offer in the segment of civil protection and rescue
He also spoke about the current situation due to the Russian aggression in Ukraine, which is strongly condemned by the party. Golob also expects decisive action from Slovenian politics, citing some urgent measures. Among the short-term ones is assistance to Ukraine as soon as possible, in addition to which he advocates the open passage of refugees through the territory of Slovenia to other countries, as he expects Slovenia not to be their target country.
At the same time, he called for the removal of the fence on the border with neighboring Croatia, as in his opinion it proved ineffective and did not contribute to curbing refugee flows.
Among the measures that are, in his opinion, necessary, is also assistance to Slovenian citizens and companies due to sanctions against Russia, which he believes are otherwise necessary.
According to him, in addition to short-term measures, we must also be aware that energy prices will remain high and that world energy prices will remain high for the next two years. Therefore, consideration needs to be given to an energy policy that must no longer be based on natural gas but on renewable energy sources and new generations of nuclear technologies.
Golob also emphasized that changes in defense policy would have to be considered. He is in favor of increasing the defense budget, but Slovenia must follow the path of smart specialization and invest in those market niches where it can be a factor and can contribute to world peace. He estimates that Slovenia can offer the most in the segment of civil protection and rescue.
About the deleted tweet about refugees: Shame on the government!
According to him, our foreign policy should also be thoroughly considered, as ""no serious country conducts foreign policy via Twitter of one individual, at least by inciting further clashes"".
He also commented on a post on government Twitter about the comparison between refugees from different backgrounds, which was later deleted. ""Every human being is a human being, which means that every refugee is also a refugee. There is no distinction between them, because one is of a different color or a different religion, we must not and will not allow it,"" he stressed. He described the record as a disgrace to the government.
Golob also touched on the events on Radiotelevizija Slovenija (RTVS) and expressed the wish that the future coalition would be among the first to draft a new law on RTVS. “Whether this will be an integral part of our program remains to be seen on March 19,” he added.
Former Minister of Defense Anton Grizold, who is involved in the preparation of the program in this area, also took part in the press conference."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/mediana_10.html,"Two months before the election, Robert Golob's new party is showing the best","In the super-election year, we are publishing a political poll for the first time, taking into account new party players on both the left and the right. The emergence of newcomers or returnees, however, confuses political maps completely anew.","First, an assessment of the work of the government. Just under a third of respondents (32.3 percent) support Prime Minister Janez Janša and his ministerial team, more than half (56.8 percent) of respondents oppose it, and one in ten (10.9 percent) is undecided.
But there is a change between the parties. The Svoboda movement, Robert Golob's party, convinced the most voters two months before the election. If the elections were held today, it would be surrounded by a good 17 percent (17.4 percent) of respondents. Although not much is known about the party - except for its leader and closest associates - they have overtaken the SDS (16.4 percent) by one percentage point, which has recorded the highest support in the last two years. The Social Democrats are third (8.6 percent), the Left is fourth (6.1 percent), and the fifth is a political experiment by Zdravko Počivalšek and others - the Let's Connect Slovenia coalition (4.8 percent).
A parliamentary troika follows; Nova Slovenija (4.5 percent), Marjan Šarc List (4.3 percent) and Alenka Bratušek's Party (3.2 percent). And the political crumbs for Our Land of the political returnee Aleksandra Pivec (2.5 percent) and The Truth of the anti-vaccinationist Zoran Stevanovič (2.1 percent).
The share of draws, taking into account new players, almost halved compared to January (13.6 percent). There are also fewer people who would not vote for any of the existing parties (7.6 percent). The rest did not want to answer (2.4 percent).
And a scale of politicians. President Borut Pahor, who overtook Health Minister Janez Poklukar, is once again the best public figure. The third is the leader of the Freedom Movement, Robert Golob.
From the eighth place onwards, other party champions are concentrated, from the head of NSi Matej Tonin through the president of another party newcomer Lida Igor Zorčič and the leader of SD Tanja Fajon.
They are followed by the president of Naša dežela Aleksandra Pivec, the champion of LMŠ Marjan Šarec and the coordinator of the Left Luka Mesec.
The Prime Minister and President of the SDS Janez Janša is 14th, followed by the leader of the Concrete Party Zdravko Počivalšek and the 16th President of the SAB Alenka Bratušek."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/zdravko-pocivalsek-intervju.html,'I did not deceive any voter. I insist because no one has proved anything to me. ',"What will be the economic consequences of the conflict for Slovenian companies operating in Ukraine and Russia? We spoke with the Minister of the Economy Zdravko Počivalšek about this, as well as about the personnel tsunami in the energy sector, the political experiment Connecting Slovenia and personal responsibility for the purchase of medical equipment, which is under the scrutiny of law enforcement agencies. The interview with the leader of the coalition Konkretno opens a series of debates with the strongest domestic political players, which we are preparing before the April elections in our main news program and on 24ur.com.","Mr. Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, let's start with the most current and hot topic: the war in Ukraine. Slovenia is responding to the crisis diplomatically and politically within the EU and NATO - this can also be seen in the activities of Prime Minister Janša. But the real power of our country in this conflict is small. But how is the government preparing for the real consequences for our country?
Resolving misunderstandings in the 21st century through violence is completely unacceptable. We are following developments in Ukraine with concern. Some time ago, I personally communicated with all Slovenian companies operating in Ukraine and Russia. We warned them of the dangers and opportunities they will have, because we already knew at the time that we would most likely respond with sanctions in such a case. Of course, it must be said that we did not expect such brutal activities. The fact is that Slovenia's cooperation with both countries is endangered in the economic field. In the first case, we have generated 1.35 billion euros in the last year, and in the second almost 300 million euros. I hope that disputes will be resolved as soon as possible through diplomatic channels and not through one that is not acceptable to us. And I believe that we will also find possible solutions for economic cooperation. Otherwise, according to what we hear, we will absolutely respect and implement the sanctions adopted by the leaders of the Member States of the European Union.
What did you decide at the closed session of the government yesterday? How can Slovenia get about 60 Slovenes and their families out of the closed country? Will Slovenian soldiers be sent to the vicinity of the crisis area within NATO?
The fact is that Slovenia will, at the request of Ukraine, help with the material resources that have been requested. On the other hand, the majority of Slovenes who have already been evacuated in Ukraine, and those who remained there, we will help according to our abilities and their needs, if necessary. In any case, I believe and hope that the measures that will be taken will have the effect of reaching a diplomatic solution as soon as possible. Otherwise, we will all have economic consequences on all sides.
Have you already estimated what the consequences will be?
I was told what the trade turnover was like last year. This traffic is at risk in any case if the problem is not resolved.
One of the consequences we can expect is refugees? The current government has had a very conservative policy on migration so far. Could this change? Will the state accept Ukrainian refugees? How much?
I can say without reservation that we will do everything and also accept all refugees who will want to come to Slovenia, as announced. Of course within some possibilities. I wouldn’t speculate on the numbers right now. Slovenia will offer refuge to refugees before the war.
What is the difference here between fleeing Ukrainians and previously fleeing Syrians and Afghans?
There is no difference. I think we have been open to refugees in principle before. This is the difference between those who abuse the events of war as an excuse for migration and those who are refugees.
A closely related topic is the energy crisis. Your government has responded with measures that include a € 150 energy voucher, an exemption from electricity bills, lower excise duties on all energy sources and € 70 million for the economy. Will this stop the increase in bills?
It must be said that we have acted quickly and that we have proven in the past that we are quick to respond to the challenges facing the population and the economy. The energy package we have adopted is temporary. That needs to be said. It was not adopted in light of what is happening in Ukraine now. I am almost certain that this event will have or already has an impact on the energy sector. The package is worth 200 million euros. It is about wanting to help 700,000 people. The network fee exemption will reduce bills by between 30 and 35 percent. The aid package was coordinated with the European Commission. First, we wanted to help energy-intensive or. only to those companies that are more affected by the crisis. We need to respect the rules of the state aid game, so we decided to help the economy with a package weighing 70 million within that 200 million. The only condition is that the growth of energy prices from last year to this year is more than 40%. Companies need to be able to assess this and make a claim based on that. That is the first step. We will take additional measures when we come to an assessment of the immediate consequences of what is happening in Ukraine. The fact is, however, that this will have an impact and has an impact on gas prices, and consequently also on petroleum products and the price of electricity. Although it is necessary to say that we produce about 85 percent of all Slovenian needs in our country, namely from water sources, nuclear work and TEŠ.
You used the very interesting phrase “We respond quickly”. The measures are going in the right direction, there is a consensus in Slovenian society, but they are coming very late. The government took action on January 29. It was only this week, however, that they were adopted by the National Assembly. It was supposed to be known on the payment slips in March, but this was the top topic already in October at the EU summit - the Western Balkans in Brdo near Kranj. Why did the government wait until almost the end of the heating season?
I insist that we responded quickly because the consequences of prices in practice came with a delay. For some companies, indeed before, but especially for those who did not have signed contracts for the supply of electricity. The point is that a small part of the economy, as well as physical consumers, felt this last year. But for most, things are changing now that their contracts have expired and things have changed further. Nevertheless, this response process came to life very quickly. After all, as in all the previous ten anti-crown packages, we quickly prepared and coordinated them with stakeholders as much as possible and then adopted them in parliament.
What about the measure of equalization of all household customers? This is on paper easy, in practice time consuming and most likely a matter of lawsuits between suppliers and managers.
We have a market in the energy field. Each physical energy consumer and each energy consumer in the economy decides for himself with whom he will conclude a contract. We have positive stories because we have introduced the market. We also have those who have opted for poorer, less successful electricity providers. It is a kind of school for all of us to be able to appreciate the stability of the companies we contract with. Of course, we need to look a little more into the background of those companies that were speculative and brought their customers to thin ice. Here we will first have to review the scope of all these events and then see where any special measures need to be taken.

While people are getting irritated by bills, a series of high-profile personnel cuts are taking place in the state energy sector. exchanges, from Robert Golob, Andrej Ribič to the last Martin Novšak. The proposal for his recall came at the suggestion of the supervisor from the Concrete quota, Ksenja Flegar, who works at your ministry. Why such a personnel tsunami just before the end of the government's term?
It should be noted that I can very qualitatively assess this development in the field of personnel, as I am finishing my term in the third government and all these personnel changes and changes are no less than in other governments in which I have worked so far. The difference, however, is that the government is now sovereign in its decisions. Previously, however, the government was a service for personnel changes of some networks from the background ...
But you were also part of these governments ...
Yes, but I did not staff as a minister. You can look at my impact on staffing in areas in state-owned companies. And even here, when you talk about the connection of personnel shifts in energy by our client, I have to say that you made me laugh. Of course, this is a government decision. The ministry is responsible for energy, which our party does not have in its hands. I believe that there have been changes in the energy sector because it is necessary to pave the way in advance to address the challenges that will be very great. The period when we had cheap energy at our disposal in Europe and Slovenia and we exported garbage is over. Today we are entering a period when it will be necessary to really take this story of the green and digital transition and the transition to a circular economy. Some time ago, some thought it was just platitudes and nicely said words. But these are changes that are important in the content structural area, within which we must also ensure stability in the energy field.
Blaž Košorok, State Secretary at the Ministry of Infrastructure, is informally coming to Novšak's position. Was his alliance with Robert Golob fatal? Is it about putting ""ours"" in key positions at a time when the state is laying the foundations for the next state megaproject - the construction of the 2nd block of JEK?
It must be said that every government has the right to appoint people to positions of responsibility of state-owned companies, whom it believes will be best implemented by the government's policy in a particular area. I personally can’t comment on personnel rosaries in terms of names because I don’t participate in it myself. It is a matter of the people who operationally lead these processes in the energy field.
In the case of Robert Golob's salary at GEN-I in November last year, MGRT initiated misdemeanor proceedings against supervisors. What did they show? Why these procedures only at the end of his term, if they could have been initiated earlier?
This process is ongoing, so I can't comment on it at this time. I can say that I believe it will be completed relatively quickly. We initiated the procedure on the recommendation of the Court of Audit, which reminded us of the discrepancies that occur in this company. The Ministry is indeed responsible for controlling salaries under the Lahovnik Act, but we have neither the instruments nor the right to exercise any control ourselves. The obligation to report is on the supervisory body of state-owned enterprises. We have asked the company to provide us with the information we need so that we can judge whether this law has been violated or not.
There is no problem here, it is absolutely the responsibility of the ministry. The timeline is a bit unusual. Mr. Golob recently received the consent of your ministry that his salary is in accordance with all laws, and at the end of his term you are problematizing this salary.
No, that's not true. He got the consent a few years ago. In the meantime, there have been changes that have changed in terms of ownership in the entire energy system. Opinions vary. After we were summoned by the Court of Audit, we also asked the company to provide us with the data once again ...
What is your opinion? Is that salary a problem?
In my opinion, it is necessary to obtain information from the supervisory authorities. Personally, I have to say that it is hard to imagine if you have four ownership-related companies, three of which are 100% state-owned, that this system would not be majority state-owned. But that's just my opinion. I am not the one who can judge what is really true. This will be decided by the people conducting the misdemeanor proceedings.
If we move to the pre-election political arena ... You are going to the parliamentary elections with an interesting political experiment - Let's connect Slovenia. The pre-election coalition and the joint list consists of five already known parties (Specifically, SLS, NLS, Greens and New Social Democrats). Is it about recycling old faces under a new brand with the key goal of maintaining a right-wing government even after the election?
Now you have placed me in a political space. I entered politics in 2014 as a non-member of the then leading party (SMC op.a.), served my term and went to the polls as a non-member of this party in 2018. I joined it only later. I have always acted on the principle that I am still applying as the president of the Concrete Party - to talk to everyone. However, I will always agree with those with whom I can coordinate my views on the future. Within this, we therefore took this first step of merging with the GAS party as part of the upgrade of our party, which has also changed its name in the meantime, and founded the Konkretno party. We are not just talking about connecting and uniting, but we are also doing this in practice. We assessed that Slovenia is painfully divided into left and right political space and that extremists rule in it. We believe that those of us who disagree with this must do everything we can to connect these sick, divided political poles made by politics, not people. Therefore, we assessed that the Connect Slovenia project is real. Within this, the parties decided to go together to the election project for the next election. We agree that we will have 88 credible candidates who will cover all spheres of the economy, the public sector and even Slovenia and will be evenly balanced. I believe that Slovenians will recognize this moment. This movement did not decide to participate in advance. After the elections, we will talk to everyone who wants to talk, and we will agree with those who will be willing to work with us on common values. There are five of them. The economy comes first. A strong economy means an adequate social, then a green and digital transition, debureaucratization and even development for all regions.
As a minister, you have introduced health measures to limit the virus throughout your term. This time, anti-vaccine candidates are also running on your list - said Marjan Podobnik. At the same time, the list also includes former State Secretary at the Ministry of Health Tina Bregant. All for the votes of the electorate, Minister?
Within the movement, we will do three things and judge things from a perspective: what is good for the economy, what is good for people, and what is good for nature. We are lucky to have come together as one who has different views on many issues. But our strength lies in knowing how to agree on key issues and how to move the matter forward. Also when it comes to vaccination. I have my own view on this story and we agree that every Slovene has the right to decide for himself whether or not to get vaccinated. But we also agree that no one has the right to threaten others with their actions. I do not want to exclude anyone in this, and I hope that we will always act in concert on key issues. I can also say frankly that negotiating is always difficult. Especially in the composition of parties that have different historical origins, but so far we are succeeding. And given this, I firmly believe that we will successfully bring this story to the polls and then, after the election, decide for me who will work with us on the road to 2030.
Among the members of the PS are several well-known names - from mayors, the president of the National Council to singing legends. Will Pahor's adviser Ernest Petrič also run for parliament?
At the moment, we have agreed with more than 75 percent of the candidates. We are in the final phase of an agreement with the candidates in several areas. I can say for myself that I have been active in politics since 2014. I would not waste too many words on famous names. However, we have many young, unknown names, many experts, athletes who have not been involved in politics so far. But there are also some seasoned political cats who have been in politics for 30 years.
It was specifically created with a transformation from SMC. ""This is no longer my party. I will no longer be the honorary president of a party that has been left without honor,"" its founder Miro Cerar said at the protest. When you joined the Janša government, the protesters accused you of cheating voters. Are you addressing completely different voters than 2018 in April 2022? What result do you expect?
I am happy to answer this oft-asked question about voter fraud. In the 2018 elections, I was elected in my environment by a large majority of votes within the SMC party. As a non-member, I received once more votes than the party average and 40 percent more than others behind me. And I did not deceive any voter. Because I defended what I promised before the election, even after the election. What I said and thought, I also did. I never said this party was mine. I am the president of a party represented by people of liberal orientations. Our party has been a sovereign party ever since I led it ...
But who managed it before?
I am not talking about before, but for now I can say that we are a real liberal party. Probably a factor as to why they're doing so poorly. We appeal to all those who put the economy first, who are in favor of the social needs of all those in need, those who support the transition to green and digital and support debureaucratization. We are committed to becoming more efficient, to bringing economic logic into the public sector. To become more successful. We appeal to all those who are in favor of the balanced development of all regions.
Namely, I asked myself how it will be in my village, which is among the most developed, in ten years. So I came up with tough questions. The point is that we will develop the country evenly in all areas, that young people everywhere will be able to get a well-paid job and that they will be able to work a business career and start a family. Until the conflict in Ukraine, I said that the border is defended by manpower, with the people who live and work there. Apparently we are again dealing with some ghosts of the past who deal with these matters in a different way. But I deeply believe that Slovenia will be strong only as much as its economy is strong.
The party, founded in 2014, has brought together different classes, people and ideals and has already undergone various transformations within it. When I joined it, there remained a core that was liberal and economically oriented. And we are building on this core.
You talked about success before ... The SMC had a record 36 MPs in 2014. In 2018 there are 10 more, and in 2022 yours specifically only 4. You take your share of responsibility for the dropout? Are you an SMC gravedigger?
Let’s start with 2018 first. I have made an important contribution to making this party the first new party to survive the first following elections with the personal result I explained earlier. And another interesting thing to say. We went to the polls with less than three percent public support. We have achieved a result that has enabled ten Members. I am proud of that because I contributed to it myself. At the initiative, I accepted the challenge to take over the leadership of the party. At the beginning, I said what I would do: to rehabilitate her and train her to be able to go to the next elections. We have the potential to bring these elections through. Of course, within the period when we decided to move forward with all those who are willing to follow the challenges and not follow the one who threw the rifle into the corn, changes have taken place. One MEP decided otherwise. A solid core remained with us. I am responsible that this party is still alive and that it will achieve a good result in the next elections. Therefore, it has all the material and human resources. It is the membership of this party that will decide where this party will go in the future.
The government in which you work has had one key task, and that is to resolve the health crisis. In your general assessment, how successful have you been at this?
Well, our government didn’t just have that task. Since 13 March 2020, of course, it has been dealing with the health crisis, which has also become economic. We are concluding this health crisis. I am proud of these 10 anti-crown measures. We responded quickly and appropriately. This is also confirmed by the results of the work of this government - we have the lowest unemployment rate and economic growth, which is among the highest in the European Union. We will be close to five percent growth this year. We have the country's bonuses, which are the best in history, and we are also recognized abroad. Based on OECD data, The Economist estimated that we are among the winners of the epidemic in the economic field, ahead of only Denmark. And that is what gives us optimism today to look ahead. And it must be said that this is the basis on which, with the right approach to digital, green and circular restructuring, we will continue to be among the most industrialized countries until 2030. Within this, we have always been fighting the pandemic. We made what you all forgot in public, a very risky decision in the first phase of the pandemic not to close down economies like our western Italian neighbors. So we achieved two. We have maintained economic flows with our partners abroad, and the economy has responded with a responsible attitude and we have not had a single serious infection within it.
But, of course, mistrust has begun to develop in the health field. We also contributed to the fact that certain measures were not successful enough through inadequate communication. But on average, I estimate that the assessment of events in the EU is that we have coped well with the health crisis and that the results are good.
I would like to mention two other important milestones within the fight against the health crisis. This was a few months ago, when we had a dilemma, whether complete closure or stricter measures, but based on various discussions with the profession, where we relied on the opinion of the Jožef Stefan Institute, we decided to - because according to their forecast there is no difference between closure and tougher measures - we choose a path that is economically much more favorable for the country. Finally, we reconsidered the opinion of the health profession on the one hand, the movement of infections and developments within the eight EU Member States, and decided on relaxation, which today allows us to breathe much better in all areas of life.
It is also necessary to say this: at the beginning of the pandemic we did not know what we were dealing with, we were all scared. Today we are all experts and we all know everything about the virus, all the strains and vaccines. One is that we must respect the measures we still have. That life after the pandemic will be different than it is now, in terms of safety and health. We must prepare for this in the offer of the entire operation in the country.
The country’s key economic statistics are really encouraging. Health statistics after two years after the first outbreak of the virus, however. Let’s look at the numbers: more than 6,000 dead, less than 60 percent fully vaccinated. Only five countries are worse than ours. Has the state put business before people’s lives?
The state has always regulated both views and given priority to healthcare. It is true that we are among the worst in terms of vaccination, but in terms of deaths ... compare the numbers and you will see that things are similar in countries that are much more vaccinated than Slovenia. I believe that, in the field of health, we are, above all, above the average among the Member States.
Soon after the onset of the health crisis, you became embroiled in an affair with the purchase of medical equipment. The CCP has found that you have violated your integrity and exceeded your authority. As they stated, even the minimum standards of public procurement were not guaranteed. You say that you are sleeping peacefully, that you would do the same again, and that you only asked the head of commodity reserves, Anton Zakrajšek, to fulfill the contract he signed himself. But the contract had not been signed at all at the time, only an order form for eight million euros. The contract was drawn up later and dated backwards. Who doesn't tell the truth?
For me, this matter is closed. What I had to say, I said. However, I have to answer the theses you put forward and do not hold. If someone has signed a contract retrospectively, you should ask them about their health. According to my information, when I asked the director of Zakrajšek to realize the contract, it was signed. So you have to have evidence, not to claim it that way ...
Mr. Gale claims that only the purchase order was signed, not the contract ...
I am talking about a conversation with the director of the institution. You're saying I got involved. Following the decision of the government, I was appointed as the Minister of Economy to take care of the purchase of protective equipment. You are talking about an affair that someone invented. We ensured that the warehouses were filled according to the adopted rules. It took the institution you cite, which declares itself to be independent, two years to establish that I did not violate the law, that I violated integrity. I, on the other hand, had to decide in one second with my colleagues at the time. See who is credible here now? There is nothing to add here. When someone talks about violating integrity, it says more about him. I would not comment on the activities of such a character, which is hidden behind the independence of the institution.
But, Mr. Minister, it is not just the CCP. In the same case, the Court of Auditors found the following ... We have findings here on 250 pages on transactions and purchases ...
Look, you don't have a single mention of a minister on those 250 pages.
No, but your ministry is mentioned and we know who the minister of this ministry is ...
And what does it say inside?
One of the key findings is that the government, your ministry, the Ministry of Health, Mors and of course the Commodity Reserves Institute were not efficient in purchasing and the ventilators were not suitable for use in treating patients with covid-19. These are quotes from the report ...
Look, these aren’t quotes, these are claims that don’t hold. For the entire Slovenian public, I would like to say once again that we only bought as many fans as healthcare ordered from four companies that were able to supply them. We couldn't buy one more. There are constructs in here that don’t hold. You do not have a single statement in the sentences supported by what you have just said. It doesn’t say we were ineffective in that way. What we needed to procure, we procured. What you said is not true ...
Sorry, I’m not claiming, but I’m quoting.
You're not quoting because you don't have this in your hands ...
How not?
You have a blank piece of paper ... You need to read what it says.
I will read: ""Despite the extraordinary circumstances, the Court of Auditors considers that the Government, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of the Economy, the Ministry of the Environment and the Institute, each within its competence, have not been effective in procuring protective medical equipment ...""
That’s why we procured as many fans as needed. All the way to the last. Therefore, we provided all the masks on time. So again, these two characters who run seemingly independent institutions can’t hide behind this seeming independence and slander me for two years. Once again, I am not mentioned as a minister. You talk about a multi-story system, but of course you attribute that to me personally. I acted efficiently, appropriately and in accordance with the law.
In the same case, you even found yourself in a police investigation in June, suspected of the crime of damaging public funds. Why, in a similar case, for example, does the Croatian minister immediately lose his position, and you still insist?
I insist because no one has proven anything to me. I cannot take imaginary affair in combination between individuals within the system, who should take care that everything is in order in Slovenia. Nothing has been proven to me, especially in the case where this show was done in collaboration with one of the media houses, where some of you knew earlier what was going to happen than I did ...
Mr Minister, that will not hold. First of all, the journalistic task is to investigate things, and at the same time, web portals close to the government reported about it the day before the investigation ...
I expect you to also publish the findings that will come on the day they will, if they will.
With pleasure and always and in any case. You’re talking about two characters hiding behind seeming independence. You seem to have a bit of a problem with the institutions that are called to do this ...
Look, I have no problem with any institution. But I have problems with people abusing institutions for political purposes. If we had something to show, we would have already done it. However, accusations cannot be built on insinuations. I have been working correctly for 60 years and my principles are such that I work based on what I got from my parents. That I can spend if I created before and that I have to follow the law, which I do. I cannot, on the basis of this, because I have decided that our party participates in some other government, be the subject of a pogrom. If I am in the right governments, everything I do is fine, but if I go to the wrong government, all actions are subject to politicization.
Two years have passed since this story and the institution, which has so many resources, is now deciding to problematize these developments. Here it is necessary to ask who is independent and why.
If we go back to the Croatian case: at that time, your colleague received only suspicion and resigned, you are not, here is the difference ...
There is no difference in whether I will resign. Nobody proved anything to me. If some have made up the suspicion that someone should resign on the basis of any suspicion, this is unacceptable.
But these are police procedures. It is no longer enough for someone to make up a suspicion ...
We could already show something. I will be happy to draw the consequences of the measures if anyone proves anything to me.
One of the segments most affected by the crisis is caterers. Many failed because they could not survive the nine-month government closure ...
That's not true.
Well, that's a fact.
That many have failed is not true. You can't fool ...
I know several of those who failed.
Many mean five and more, you don’t know them because they aren’t.
I am just an ordinary citizen and I know more of them. But still, financial aid was given to everyone who had at least a 20% drop in turnover. But those who wanted to make a living still tried to work in different ways, such as delivery. And now, if they have earned more, they have to repay the payroll allowance. Apparently it was more worthwhile for some to be locked up than to work ...
I'm glad you asked me that question. All ten anti-crown packages are worth six billion euros. So far, 4.4 billion euros have been used. Of this, 2.3 billion went to the economy, one billion to hospitality and tourism. Tourism was the most affected industry even before the apparent crisis, but we also helped it the most. Within this billion, we also have tourism vouchers, where we have decided between two options, namely to give the tourism industry money for not working or to distribute the same amount to all citizens to spend on tourism and the economy must make an effort to do so, to get that money. I think that we did the right thing and achieved two things, namely that the tourist economy has survived and that we have a collateral benefit, that we Slovenes have realized that it is possible to spend a holiday in Slovenia as well.
What you claim, I must refute once again. It is a fact that the tourism industry has been the hardest hit, but it is also a fact that we have helped it the most. And no one can be deceived that tourism has been left alone. Nor can anyone say that many entities in this industry have failed. However, there is another fact that we are facing a difficult period. Tourism will be different in the postcovid period. The health and safety aspects will need to be taken into account. However, we are lucky to have everything we need in the vicinity of Slovenia, as far as the market is concerned. We have an area that is large. In the circle of Milan, Vienna, Budapest and Belgrade, there is a market through which we can reach Slovenia in four hours. We will have to develop our tourism transformation in the direction of an active green destination for five-star experiences with our offer in the direction of continuing to be relevant. However, we will have problems in the area of ​​reviving air destinations. The renewal of tourism will take at least a few years. I am optimistic and believe that this story will go on positively.

They emphasized that Slovenia was ""united and united with its allies in the EU and NATO in condemning the Russian army's aggression against Ukraine and in its efforts to provide Ukraine with all necessary assistance"".","The National Security Council (SNAV) discussed various national security aspects of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, it was announced after a session convened by Prime Minister Janez Jansa. SNAV members and those invited to the meeting were acquainted with the current situation on the battlefields in Ukraine and with international responses to aggression.

The relevant services reported on preparations for the accommodation of refugees and various measures to help Ukraine. ""Slovenia, as a member of the EU and NATO, is coordinating its actions with allies. It is in Slovenia's national security interest to keep Ukraine from aggression, to reduce the threat to the EU-NATO Eastern bloc and to avoid a new Cold War or escalation. sanctions against the Russian Federation, ""they wrote.

After the session, the President of the Republic Borut Pahor and the President of the LMŠ Marjan Šarec, who was invited to the session as the President of the largest opposition party in the National Assembly, confirmed that Slovenia is united in this regard.
""The fact that Slovenian politics is united is very important in such a situation, that we are together with the allies, where we consult and coordinate, as well,"" Pahor said.
He described the reasons given by Russia for the aggression as unfounded, but that it creates a moral advantage for Ukraine in the world public. He added, however, that with military assistance to Ukraine, possible ways to end the hostilities should not be overlooked.
Šarec said that today they heard an analysis of what was happening. ""Above all, we found that Slovenia stands united here, regardless of our political colors,"" he said, adding that it was ""an act of aggression that has no excuse."" Regarding Slovenia's activities, he also emphasized the importance of coordination with the EU and NATO.

In a statement to the press on the sidelines of the SD conference, she emphasized that she considered this cooperation in resolving this crisis crucial.
Regarding the expectations from the session, Snava said that she wanted Slovenia to be actively involved in all efforts to establish peace, return all actors to the negotiating table and hold talks through diplomatic channels.
""The EU has already adopted a very strong package of economic and financial sanctions. I welcome that they have been adopted. However, any isolation of the Russian regime can be risky if there are no agreements through diplomatic channels,"" Fajonova said.
Janša then announced that a representative of the largest opposition party was invited to the meeting on the basis of the Snava Rules of Procedure, which have been the same or similar for decades. ""However, if the President of the Republic Borut Pahor decides that it is necessary to convene an informal consultation of all parliamentary parties, the government will, of course, provide him with all the necessary information and logistics,"" he said.
He also tweeted Estonian Prime Minister Kaje Kallas, who said Estonia had banned all Russian airlines from flying in its airspace. Janša wrote that Slovenia would do the same.

In the upcoming series, the First Lady will star alongside Michelle Pfeiffer, who will play Betty Ford, and Gillian Anderson, who will play Eleanor Roosevelt. Which other actresses have faced this very special challenge in the past?","The role of first lady has a special significance in American politics. In the history of the United States, a total of 54 women have held this title, including 43 officials and 11 who have been given this role because of the president's single status or widowhood, or because the president's wife was unable to perform her duties. . Certain first ladies have left such a big mark in history because of their work, attitude and other factors that they have earned an artistic portrayal. And which actresses made the first ladies immortalized in the world of film and television?
Eternal Jackie Kennedy
Because of her style, John F. Kennedy’s wife quickly became a fashion icon and an inspiration to women around the world. Her style, still considered one of the best among first ladies today, however, was not all that Jackie Kennedy could offer. Although she was not interested in politics, she helped her husband both during the campaign and during her term due to her knowledge and knowledge of foreign languages. The assassination of Kennedy and her bloodied outfit went down in history forever and received several film depictions.
Jackie Kennedy's fashion shoes include Natalie Portman, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of the First Lady, Katie Holmes in the miniseries The Kennedys, Jodi Balfour in the Krona series, Ginnifer Goodwin in Killing Kennedy and Minka Kelly in Butler. Kennedy has already staged a total of more than ten actresses, which confirms that the wife of the 35th president is one of the most popular first ladies.
Eleanor Roosevelt, first lady with the longest term
As the 32nd President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt led the country for 12 years, Eleanor Roosevelt also went down in history as the first lady with the longest term. This and the fact that she advocated for the rights of women and blacks convinced the filmmakers that she deserved to be portrayed on big and small screens.
In the film version of the popular musical Annie, Roosevelt was portrayed by actress Lois de Banzie, and in the upcoming series The First Lady, Gillian Anderson, who last impressed with her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in the Krona series, will step into her shoes.
Actress Sally Field also received a lot of praise for her portrayal of the first lady, who even received an Oscar nomination for her interpretation of Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln in the film Lincoln. The wife of the “honest Aba” had to navigate between her husband’s progressive and Western ideas and the traditional and more conservative views of her family during her tenure. The couple’s relationship, marked by Mary’s health and alleged bipolar disorder, was tried by Fields in the film with a lot of improvisation to capture alongside Oscar-winning Daniel Day-Lewis.
Among the first ladies who did not live in the shadow of their presidential husbands, many include Betty Ford, the wife of Gerald Ford, who will also appear in the series The First Lady with the help of actress Michelle Pfeiffer. Recognizing the problem of addiction to addictive substances, Ford drew attention to a broader issue. Because of the fight against stigma, her name has become synonymous with the fight against addiction. Her idea was later continued by Nancy Reagan, wife of Ronald Reagan. In the film Butler, her life was staged by Jane Fonda. “I tried to play her the way she was: an influential, loyal and strong first lady,” the actress said in an interview.
The first ladies, who recently held an important title, also received artistic depictions. In the series American Crime Story: Impeachment, which recounts the events of the Clinton-Lewinsky affair, Clinton's wife and later presidential candidate Hillary Clinton played Edie Falco. Laura Bush and ""Her Voice, Calmness and Hairstyle,"" actress Elizabeth Banks tried to portray in W, and actress Viola Davis was the last to join the group of actresses who had the opportunity to step into the shoes of America's first ladies on the big or small screen. .
""Michele was 'someone' the moment she cried out to the world""
Davis, who is considered one of the best American actresses, accepted the role of first lady with great awe. She explained at the press conference that she did not want to offend anyone with her portrayal, and stressed that Michelle Obama has always been important and that it did not become so until her husband became president.
""You never got the feeling that she was second-rate or standing in her husband's shadow. Michele was 'someone' the moment she cried out into this world,"" she said of the first black first lady, who is still after her husband's end. mandate remained active in the field of socio-political issues. Because of her popularity among the people, many even considered being able to run for president.
First ladies also present in the sketches
In addition to classic filmmakers, some of the first ladies also inspired the creators of the comedy show Saturday Night Live, in which they often appeared as the main characters in sketches. During Donald Trump's tenure, Melania Trump, who has not yet received a film portrayal, has repeatedly attracted the attention of comedians.
Actress Jennifer Coolidge recently expressed her desire to play Trump in a film one day. ""Where do I sign?"" she joked, adding that she thought Melania wouldn't be thrilled about it: ""I'm sure Melania would be offended."" Only who and in what way will portray the current first lady, dr. Jill Biden?"
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/mineva-30-let-od-izbrisa-25671-ljudi.html,"It has been 30 years since the erasure of 25,671 people","It has been 30 years since Slovenia deleted 25,671 people from the register of permanent residents. On Friday, the President of the Republic Borut Pahor publicly apologized to the erased. The president of the Civil Initiative of Erased Activists, Irfan Beširović, warns that all injustices have not yet been eliminated and that the erased are still living in the country without a regulated status.","On February 26, 1992, the state deleted more than 25,000 people from the register of permanent residents, members of the remaining Yugoslav republics who lived in Slovenia and did not obtain citizenship in time, and transferred them to t. i. passive records. With this, they lost virtually all rights.
The erased then argued for many years that the erasure was illegal, but politics did not listen to them. This was established only in 1999 and 2003 by the Constitutional Court, which also laid the foundations for the legal regulation of this issue.
In addition to the state's liability for damages, which was only confirmed by the European Court of Human Rights after unsuccessful lawsuits in Slovenian courts, they also made constant efforts to officially apologize to the state for the erasure. On Friday, however, the erased only received an official apology from the state, issued by President Pahor. Amnesty International sees the apology as ""important moral satisfaction"" for the erased, and the president of the Civil Initiative of Erased Activists, Beširović, said that he perceived it as a moral victory.
Neširović, however, pointed out that all injustices have not yet been eliminated, and that the erased are still living in Slovenia without a regulated status. On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the erasure, the Civil Initiative of Erased Activists, Amnesty International Slovenia and the Peace Institute call on the state to ensure that these people, who have been living in Slovenia for decades, obtain a permanent residence permit and their special position is respected. protected their dignity.
The 30th anniversary of the erasure was also commemorated on Friday at the Kresija Gallery in Ljubljana, where an exhibition entitled 30 Years of Fear was opened. It will be on view until the end of March."

As an announcement of suspicions of several criminal offenses, he will be handed over to the investigative bodies and the government will be called for his immediate resignation, said the chairman of the commission Robert Pavšič from LMŠ.","The interim report of the parliamentary commission of inquiry covers about a hundred pages. According to Pavšič, the main findings are those ""that the people have been following and knowing since the very beginning and beginning of the epidemic"".
""This government is proven to be responsible for all the wrong measures, for excessive deaths, for financially inappropriate measures and for direct interference in the profession,"" Pavšič said at today's press conference. According to him, the political responsibility of the fourteenth Slovenian government as a collective body is emphasized. Special responsibility is attributed to Prime Minister Janez Janša, ""who arbitrarily changed the system several times in violation of the well-founded and already adopted rules of dealing with the epidemic, adapting it to himself just because he followed some other agendas,"" Pavšič said. However, he added that the mentioned agendas will be dealt with by other institutions, namely the interim report will be handed over to the investigative bodies as a declaration of suspicion of several criminal offenses.
Pavsic cited the purchase of rapid tests as one of those other interests, but the non-purchase of vaccines when it was most needed, ""and remember, we had a bus death day in 2020,"" he said, adding that these surpluses death must never be forgotten.
Pavšič said that the government of Janez Janša often referred to the profession when adopting anti-antiviral measures, and the profession confirmed that it had not been heard at numerous hearings of the parliamentary inquiry commission, most recently former Minister of Health Tomaž Gantar, former head of the expert group. -19 Bojana Beović, former member of the expert group Mario Fafangel and member of the expert group Miroslav Petrovec. ""The profession, which was appointed by the government itself, was also neglected and was not heard on several occasions,"" he said.
Pavšič hopes to discuss the report at the next regular session of the National Assembly. They will propose eight resolutions to the National Assembly, ""mainly because such a story and such handling of such catastrophic consequences would never happen again,"" he said. In addition to irregularities in the management of the epidemic, the conclusions will also propose the protection of t. i. whistleblowers and empowering the media to realistically, credibly and independently monitor everything that happens in the field of politics, economy and impact on everyday events, even in emergencies.
In the end, this will be decided by the politician, who sees this interim report as diametrically opposed, that ""everything was done perfectly and everything was good"", Pavšič warned. He added that such an opinion reflects so far only the announced separate opinion. Pavšič did not reveal today who will file it.
One of the conclusions of the interim report is that the commission calls on Janša's government to resign immediately, although it would not shorten their term of office given the parliamentary elections. ""But at least some symbolic gesture can come from the other side, and with it the recognition that everything was not as rosy as we have been portrayed in the last few months,"" he said.
According to Pavšič, the work of the commission of inquiry will continue, some more witnesses will be questioned, but they will not be able to complete the work by the end of their term due to the scope and time constraints. However, he hopes that the next convocation of the National Assembly will continue with the work of the commission of inquiry."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/preiskovalna-komisija-o.html,"Before the parliamentary commission, Vojko Urbas denied the planned obstruction of criminal investigations",Director of the Criminal Police Administration Vojko Urbas categorically denied before the commission of inquiry investigating suspicions of political interference in the work of the police that there were personnel changes in the police in order to delay the pre-criminal investigation into the purchase of protective equipment.,"Vojko Urbas, director of the Criminal Police Administration, testified before the commission of inquiry today. He emphasized that the tweet of Interior Minister Aleš Hojs did not affect his work, and denied that anyone was involved in the work of the National Investigation Office (NPU), which is an internal unit of the criminal police, and ordered what the NPU should investigate. According to Urbas, there has never been such a case at the NPU.
""The closer the parliamentary elections are, the more confirmed are the assumptions repeatedly made by the commission of inquiry that the subordination of the Slovenian Police is to the will of Slovenian politics, also because some key criminal investigations are delayed."" ""It would be possible planned obstruction or political pressure, which we also expected. We do not expect epilogues in these cases until the elections,"" said Rudi Medved, chairman of the commission of inquiry, in a press release. As he pointed out, ""the fact is that the investigation of suspicious purchases of protective medical equipment, which also includes the Minister of the Economy Zdravko Počivalšek, has been going on for more than a year and a half and that they will only now question a key witness."" ""One of the main goals of this government when it took over the government was to slow down, to block all investigations in which people from this government or the SDS party are involved in any way,"" Medved claims.
Urbas categorically denied that there were any personnel changes in the police in order to slow down the investigation, which also includes the Minister of the Economy, just before the elections. According to him, the mentioned final report is in the final stage. He also expressed confidence that the investigation would be completed in due course. ""The matter is being resolved. Some more investigative activities are needed and when all is completed, the assistant in charge of operations will review the report and give it to the director of the National Investigation Office for signature,"" Urbas told members of the commission.

Medveda was also interested in whether the police had already investigated and found the culprit for the leak of information in connection with the planned house search at the Minister of Economy Počivalšek in the case. He added that such a suspicion also occurred with tax advisor Rok Snežič. ""These matters are slipping away from you like a strainer,"" suggested Medved, who was also interested in who within the police could have a motive to discredit the investigation if this matter concerns the policy of the ruling structure or. a person close to the government set. Urbas does not know who released this information to the public, but he agreed that it was time to stop it. He also stressed that there are too many cases of such information leakage. “We had clues that people were sitting at home on the couch at six in the morning, dressed, waiting for house searches,” he said.
Regarding some of the disputed jobs of the fired criminal Škelzen Bajrami in the past, Urbas explained that he himself wrote a proposal for his re-employment in the police. He decided to do so on the basis of Bajrami's rich references, as well as the fact that Bajrami was acquitted of the charges of sexual and other harassment, he said.
Part of today's session of the commission of inquiry was closed to the public. According to Medved, the final report will be prepared by the commission before the elections are delayed.
The parliamentary inquiry commission, which is investigating political interference in the work of the police, decided on Monday that the conditions for announcing the suspicion of committing a crime against Interior Minister Ales Hojs, State Secretary in the Cabinet of Prime Minister Zan Mahnic and Prime Minister Janez Jansa were met. As Medved pointed out today, only the prosecution will judge whether the case is worth a criminal complaint: ""I have no doubt that the prosecution will recognize that this is worth the complaint,"" he is convinced.
Let's remember
The indictment against them will be filed due to insulting accusations against the parliamentary commission of inquiry, its members and experts who damage the honor and reputation of the commission of inquiry as a state body, explained the chairman of the parliamentary commission Rudi Medved (LMŠ) on Monday.
V. d. On 6 May 2020, Anton Travner, Director General of the Police, dismissed Darko Muženič, Director of the National Investigation Office, and appointed Igor Lamberger in his place. He calculated that he would later be selected in a public tender for the post of director, but fell out of favor with politicians because he failed to prevent house searches of Economy Minister Zdravko Počivalšek over an affair over the controversial purchase of protective equipment or fans.
At the end of July 2020, however, v. d. Andrej Jurič, who replaced Travner, appointed Uroš Lepoša acting NPU. Already in October, Lepoša decided to resign. Less than a week later, Petra Grah Lazar took over the leadership of the National Investigation Office.
Due to political support, Grahovo has been accompanied by privileges from the very beginning. First, she met in person with Prime Minister Janez Janša, who is also on the list of invited guests, and promised her this director position. Then the first man of the Police, Andrej Jurič, had to invite her to the meeting, without Grahova formally applying for the job or sending any letter.
Boštjan Lindav, the former first man of the Criminal Police Administration, also applied for the post."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/trump-o-sarmantnem-putinu-ki-ljubi-svojo-domovino.html,"Trump praises the ‘genius’ move of the ‘charming’ Putin, who loves his homeland","With such a public eulogy given to him by the former US president, even the mighty Russian leader Vladimir Putin could shyly blush to his ears. While condemnations of Putin's conduct toward Ukraine are pouring in from around the world, and U.S. first man Joe Biden immediately imposed sanctions as a result, his predecessor sees things quite differently. Donald Trump described the recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as genius, and Putin as a peacemaker, a smart man who is a big deal, but also a charming and proud man who loves his homeland.","Trump hosted the radio talk show The Buck Sexton Show on Tuesday, where he broke his striking silence about the Ukrainian crisis to applaud Putin and praised his move to send troops to Donetsk and Lugansk in support of Russian separatists. ""This is ingenious,"" he said of his decision to recognize the independence of both regions and send Russian troops to help them.
""So Putin is now saying that they are independent - a large part of Ukraine. I said to myself, how smart is that ?! He will go and be a peacekeeper. We would also need something like that on our southern border. This is the strongest peacekeeping force I have ever I've never seen so many tanks. They'll keep the peace, for sure, ""he exclaimed. ""Whatever you think. This is a man who is very smart. I know him very well. Very, very well,"" he continued.
He also asserted that the situation in Ukraine would be different because of his personal relationship with Putin if he were still sitting in the White House. ""That would never have happened if we had been there. Why didn't something like this happen during the Trump administration,"" the eloquent Trump wondered. I know Putin very well. We understand each other very well. He liked me, he liked me. You know he is a considerable bite, he is charming and proud. But the way he loves his homeland? He loves it. But I think now he knows a little differently, ""he replied to himself, slightly unrelated.
He concluded his reflection by commenting that the current US president had not responded to Russian aggression. ""You have to admit, it was all very smart. You know, what was Bidn's response? It wasn't there. They didn't have it. And that's sad, very sad,"" Washington scolded. The U.S. immediately imposed economic sanctions, and a White House spokeswoman responded to Trump's allegations: ""We try not to take advice from anyone who praises President Putin and his military strategy,"" said Jen Psaki, who recalled how Trump backed Russia at the annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, another part of Ukraine: ""It's a slightly different approach,"" she added cynically.
Putin's admirer for many years
Trump has never hidden his sympathy for Putin. He told him he was a fan 15 years ago. In 2007, Vladimir Putin was named Person of the Year by Time magazine, and Trump immediately sent him a personal congratulation. ""Dear President Putin,"" he wrote. ""You definitely deserve it. As you've probably heard, I'm a big fan of yours,"" he added.
But the Russian autocrat did not let himself be softened. In 2013, when Trump was still a businessman, he wondered on Twitter if Putin would participate in his licensed Miss Universe beauty pageant in Moscow and if they would become best friends. Putin did not show up, but in the years that followed, Trump repeatedly praised his strategic insight and defended his moves, which angered the rest of the world.
In 2016, there was an affair when U.S. intelligence claimed that Russia had interfered in the election in which Trump won. He later said that it was actually Ukraine that did it to incite Russia. One senior government official then revealed to the Washington Post what Trump cited as a source for these claims: ""Putin told me.""
In the end, however, Trump managed to establish the much-desired relationship with a world leader he so admired. In 2018, the two met in person for the first time as presidents, and the summit, described by many as historic, took place at a time when relations between Moscow and Washington were at their lowest level in decades. Trump also pointed this out a few hours before the meeting, blaming America: ""Our relations with Russia have never been worse thanks to years of American stupidity and now due to a rigged witch hunt,"" Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to a special U.S. investigation into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election. Their closed-door talks then lasted as long as two hours, and Trump described them as a good start.
Finally, Putin himself caressed his soul and ego when he gave him public recognition. He said he hoped at the time that Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton in the election because of his desire to normalize relations with Russia, and described his successor Biden as a career politician who is the complete opposite of Trump, an exceptional and talented individual."

And they are spiced with emotional public opinion,"'Trust in science' has become one of the most obsolete phrases of the corona period - from which we are slowly leaving with less confidence in science. What happened? Once again in history, we have seen science collide with public opinion and politics, and the combination of all three components was ultimately the one that regulated people’s lives. Often every few days differently. After a long period of chaos, all stakeholders will have time to reflect. The question, however, is whether they will do it.","""Politics must first and foremost listen to the profession. It is true that in the end politics decides because society is so organized. But we politicians must always pour pure wine,"" said the director of the National Institute of Public Health, Dr. Milan Krek for our portal - as part of a short miniseries, where the connection between politics and science is under scrutiny.
In two years of repeating ‘Trust the Science’, the reversals in the public health guidelines have caused confusion. People wondered what the latest tips on masks were, how long they should self-isolate, what the recommended distance was, and even whether the virus was more dangerous at 11pm than 10pm. Many, disappointed by the change in recommendations, reacted to the scientific community with skepticism or distrust.
But as Krek said, in the end, politics decides. The phrase 'Trust Science', repeated all this time by politicians led by US President Joe Biden, who persuaded the domestic and world public that this is how he differs from his predecessor Donald Trump and populists like him, becomes something else: ‘trust political decisions based in part on scientific advice’.
So, to a large extent, the final decisions also depend on economic, political and public opinion issues, as the voters have the last word at the very end - and they are always somewhere at the door of the election. If voters are dissatisfied, there are changes on the horizon, which the ruling politics always and everywhere wants to avoid. Therefore, in today's article we will touch on the stakeholder who mainly influences the policies that are always on the hunt for votes - the general public and its perception of (scientific) situations and the consequent impact on their development.
Toxic mix of science and politics
Both science and politics want to enjoy public trust. How is trust built? Trust is a form of reasoning based on knowledge or previous experience. We learn to trust people because we have the experience to behave in a predictable way, which makes us confident about their future behavior, Christina Boswell, a professor of politics at the University of Edinburgh and vice president of public policy at the British Academy, told the LSE.
""In large and complex societies, however, this trust cannot be based solely on our direct experience. We must therefore base our trust on approximate characteristics - we rely on those who share values ​​with us, support the same political party or live in our neighborhood. in cases like covid-19, we also rely on people with education in a particular field, ”he says.
Future behavior can also be inferred from actions. If we know that violations of rules or contracts will be punished and that people in general will be motivated to keep their word, then we can let go of our doubts and make that leap and trust, he points out.
""Unfortunately, the listed mechanisms for building trust in the case of politics are severely undermined. The public has become extremely cynical about everything that motivates politics - and the reasons for this cynicism are reflected in a number of broader social and political trends. opposition, which makes voters less confident about how political parties will promote their interests, disorderly policy-making processes leading to compromises and disappointment as governments fail to deliver on their promises, and we see a growing influence of political behavior that sees voters as consumers in the political market, where politicians then want to increase their power by marketing attractive products, ”says Boswell.
All in all, it has led to politics enjoying extremely low confidence, 24 per cent of it was in one of the surveys on the Island she cites.
Science has, in principle, entered this game in better shape. 87 percent of people are said to trust her on the Island, and it is similar elsewhere. However, this half also has problems. Advances in medicine in many other fields unquestionably offer convincing evidence of advances in science. This creates confidence that its development, for example, will continue to provide quality medicines. But it is also important that the public has confidence in the motivation and conduct of these professionals. Medical science is supposed to be guided by clear ethical guidelines, which have been violated several times in the past. In addition, the public is directly exposed to the actions of health professionals, builds trust based on experience - directions.
It is also often somewhat unclear to the public what drives scientists forward. Accustomed to communication in scientific journals and long hours of research, scientists often do not explain their motives to the public, which often helps to maintain the cynical belief that the only motivator is money.
Bottom line - if politics needs improvement in all areas, science also needs reflection when it comes to ethical and public action, if science and policy cooperation is to be better in all areas - better in the future.
Emotional (and not rational public)
Better politics and science should be demanded by the general public, which alone has the power to hold its politicians and scientists accountable. But what if she does not lack her own problems - the absence of the rational is especially clear.
Studies show that we have traveled for four decades to the point where the objective is almost non-existent, only emotions and beliefs count. The trend did not start with Trump.
“While the current era of post-truth has surprised many, the study shows that over the past 40 years, public interest has experienced an accelerated shift from the collective to the individual and from rationality to emotion,” say U.S. and Dutch researchers.
""Our work shows that the social balance between emotions and reason has shifted back to what it was about 150 years ago,"" says researcher Dr. Marten Scheffer for Webmed Health News. ""This means that scientists, professionals and policy makers will need to think about the best way to respond to this societal change.""
The findings are based on a very detailed analysis of the language of millions of books, newspaper articles, Google searches, television reports, social media posts and other sources. Researchers analyzed how often the 5,000 most frequently used words have appeared in the last 170 years, and found that the use of words related to facts and reasoning, such as ""determine"" and ""conclusion,"" has been drastic since the 1980s. fell. However, the use of words related to human emotions, such as “feel” and “believe,” has greatly increased.
Scheffer notes that the rapid development of science and technology from 1850 to 1980 had great social and economic benefits that helped raise the status of the scientific approach, the role of spiritualism diminished in the modern world. But since 1980, this trend has undergone a major reversal, as beliefs have become more important than facts for many people.
In the political world, the consequences are clear, they influence policies of all colors and help create discord. With the advent of climate change and the health crisis, the implications for science have become clear. ""Our public debate seems to be increasingly driven by what people want to be true, not what is actually true. As a scientist, this worries me,"" he added to Webmed Health News. Johan Bollen, professor of computer science at Indiana University.
When money for research depends on opinion, propaganda is the currency
His concern is justified, as it affects not only public dialogue but also what and how is being researched. Many at the time of the pandemic wondered how it was possible that the vaccine was made so quickly. The answer is simple, pointed out by many scientists who have been trying for years to move their own research projects - money - at least one step further. Countries have allocated millions to this project and this has meant that scientists have been able to work extremely fast.
But money is becoming more and more dependent on the emotions of the public, as politics just likes to please the public. However, the public often mistakenly thinks that politics likes to please its own whims. The fact is that politics is maintained in power in democratic systems with the support of the electorate.
Brazilian scientists, for example, have been left without a big piece of the financial pie because populist President Jair Bosonaro doesn't like science. where certain groups demand the dismissal of scientists who would not blindly follow gender theory and whatnot, often again beliefs that are based more on emotion-enhancing than on science.
Scheffer and co-workers have found quite a few factors that have encouraged the acceptance of untruths over the facts in recent years. The world wide web comes first. Its rise in the late 1980s and its growing role as a primary source of news and information allowed more misconceptions based on belief to spread and spread like wildfire. The study also found that the use of words related to emotions and intuition increased especially around 2007 along with the global rise of social media, which launched Facebook, Twitter and others into the mainstream and replaced more traditional sources of information that they are obliged to verify the facts or to confront opinions. According to researchers, the financial crisis in 2007 added fuel to the fire. based on feelings against the establishment. Nor can anti-intellectualism, which is defined as a general distrust of experts and intellectuals, be ignored. This mistrust can have several different sources, the most important of which is populism. Namely, some populists see experts as a class of elites who exercise power over virtuous ordinary citizens. Anti-intellectualism is also said to be encouraged by ideological conservatism, intuitionism and religious fundamentalism.
Propaganda is a new currency, experts say, whose criticism also applies to traditional media, which instead of sticking to the facts, in the desire for pleasure and in the competition with social networks, reduced the level of information quality, connected the facts with entertainment and began to explain them. in an oversimplified way.
Science needs a new concept of communication, the public a better understanding of science
Clear, high-quality and ethical science can make a significant contribution to the higher quality of the discussion. Many believe that in the absence of good politics, we need more 'good science' to listen to. However, this can be annoying for scientists, as it means more exposure and responsibility. It is still true - and we have seen in the case of the Crown Crisis - that important political decisions - rarely, if ever - are made solely on the basis of science, but are based on facts and values ​​or on facts and personal experience. In addition, long-held beliefs or core values ​​often prevail over scientific evidence when making political decisions.
But the public, which sometimes also demands the supremacy of science, needs a better understanding of science and its limitations. Science is not a magic solution with all the answers. Thus, it should be borne in mind that there is usually some uncertainty in scientific evidence and there are very few situations in which all scientists agree on what the data presents or how the data should be interpreted. But scientists understand that despite some uncertainty and disagreement, they may be behind the scientific consensus and recommendations they give to the public, and this can be very worrying for non-scientists, that is, the general public.
We were also able to see how scientific theories work in practice in the case of the Crown Crisis. Scientific theories are often revised or even replaced when additional information is obtained. Scientists accept these revisions as a normal part of the scientific process, while the public may see them as signs of a lack of authority or expertise, explains Alan I. Leshner, emeritus director of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. It should also be borne in mind that not all science is equally definitive. Some scientific theories are weaker than others, and some data sets are more reliably explained than others, he says.
Therefore, since neither science nor politics nor society have definitive answers, future crises will also bring a search for consensus among stakeholders. However, the lesson of the Crown Crisis may be that all decision-makers - including each individual - need even more awareness of their responsibility in the process of making good and rational decisions."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/igor-bavcar.html,Will Igor Bavčar be granted parole six months before the end of his sentence?,"Formerly respected politician, independence activist and businessman, the first husband of Istrabenz, who is now a convict and prisoner, Igor Bavčar, is expected to be released soon and will be able to play basketball and fish in peace on the weekends in Blok. But he has not yet served his sentence or returned millions. However, the commission approved his conditional release a few days ago, unofficially. And even though Bavčar is still in other criminal proceedings, legal experts explain, parole is still possible.","
We asked Igor Bavčar himself whether the allegations about the early termination of the prison sentence, as reported by the journalist colleagues of the Dnevnik newspaper, were true. The answer, however, is that he does not make statements about the case and ends the phone call.
The Ministry of Justice did not confirm or deny the news, but the information surprised many because one of the better-known Slovenian prisoners, who has not yet paid the million-dollar debt to the state, is still on the list of biggest tax debtors. But how can parole be possible if other criminal proceedings are pending against him? The fact that someone is still in other criminal proceedings is one of the factors influencing the assessment of whether the commission will grant parole, but it does not mean that parole is refused for this reason - this is just one of the circumstances, ""explains doc. dr. Miha Šepec from the Faculty of Law, University of Maribor.
Bavčar is still awaiting a retrial regarding the sale of Intereuropa shares
In addition to, for example, the possible danger of recidivism, prisoner behavior and many other criteria, which, however, until the penultimate meeting of the commission, as we can conclude, he clearly did not meet. ""If the circumstances of the case have not changed, it is unfounded to expect that if they rejected him three months ago, now they are approved at one time. It is certainly true that the more we approach the end of the sentence, the more likely the conditional dismissal is approved, ""says Šepec.
After five, Bavčar has only a little more than half a year left in prison, which means that he meets at least the first condition for dismissal, which has served at least half of the sentence. So if the assumptions are true, we can expect the former outdoor politician soon. ""It is also not in the interest of delaying this, if the commission decides that he has been granted the right to dismiss, then it is usually fast within a week,"" concludes Šepec, but Bavčar has not yet said the last word in court. He is due to stand trial again on Friday for allegedly illegal transactions with the sale of Intereuropa shares, the verdict of which was annulled in 2019."

Kad and Slovenski državni holding (SDH), which together own almost 47 percent of Sava, will exercise the pre-emption right for the ownership share and accompanying receivables. Earlier, at a correspondence session, the government provided the Slovenian State Holding (SDH) with funds for the purchase of a stake in Sava, which is being sold by the York Fund. The share capital of SSH will increase from just over 260 million euros by 41.6 million euros to just under 302 million euros, the Ministry of Finance announced. The opposition SD, LMŠ, SAB and Levica welcome the government's decision.","
""The Supervisory Board of Kapitalska družba today supported the Management Board's proposals, which are the basis for exercising the pre-emption right to purchase shares and receivables of Sava by the Slovenian State Holding and Kapitalska družba, in accordance with the adopted resolutions of the Government,"" reads the statement. , which started on Friday and ended today.
A similar decision is expected to be made on Friday afternoon by the Supervisory Board of SSH. .
Namely, York offered for sale its 43.2% stake in Sava, which through Sava Turizem owns facilities at key locations in Portorož, Bled and northeastern Slovenia. At the end of January, he signed a purchase agreement with Prestige Tourism, which is backed by Hungarian capital, but the state has the option to exercise the pre-emption right. Through SSH and Kapitalska družba, it owns almost 47% of Sava.
On the sidelines of a meeting with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Lendava, Prime Minister Janez Janša said today that the government intends to recapitalize SSH for the amount that will enable the exercise of the pre-emption right for Sava's share. The Ministry of Finance only wrote that the purpose of the recapitalization is to provide SSH funds for the implementation of activities related to the implementation of the tourism strategy and in connection with the adopted annual capital investment management plan for 2022.
Minister of the Economy Zdravko Počivalšek, meanwhile, expressed satisfaction that ""we have a broad political consensus to exercise the pre-emption right"". ""The government has provided the foundation by recapitalizing SSH. I believe that the story will go in the right direction and we will lead to the restructuring of Sava in a way that will be good for tourism, employees and Slovenia,"" he wrote.
According to today's government decision, SSH must ensure a forensic investigation into the operations of both the company and its subsidiaries for a period of ten years before the purchase, within four months of acquiring any capital investment it will obtain from these funds.
The recapitalization will be carried out by issuing a maximum of 24,922 ordinary registered dematerialized no-par value shares at an issue value of EUR 1,669.1704223 per share. The state will pay the amount of 41.6 million euros in the form of a cash contribution, the government decided. According to the new law, the state will have a share in SSH in the nominal value of EUR 301.8 million. SSH and Kad have until March 3 to exercise the pre-emption right for York's 43.2% stake in Sava. Kad, which has a share of about 28% in the Sava, and SSH a little less than 19%. According to unofficial information, the Supervisory Board of Kada continues the session on the exercise of the pre-emption right today, and according to unofficial information, the supervisors of SSH are expected to make a decision on Friday.
The opposition welcomes the provision of funds for the purchase of a stake in Sava
Opposition SD, LMŠ, SAB and Levica welcomed the government's intention on the sidelines of today's extraordinary parliamentary session, but remain skeptical. The request to convene an extraordinary session of the National Assembly, at which deputies are expected to discuss the exercise of the pre-emption right on Monday and recommendations to the government to ensure this as an assembly of Kapitalska družba (Kad) and SSH, will be withdrawn when a written commitment is made. As stated in today's reactions in part of the opposition, they themselves have always called on the government to take such a decision. ""We have always said only one thing in the opposition, Slovenia's strategic interest must be defended, Slovenia's tourism must be defended and protected, and we are glad to hear from the Prime Minister for the first time today that this is the case,"" said SD MP Meira. Hot. She also pointed out that the government made such a decision only after ""weeks and weeks of calls, when we heard evasion and manipulation from the government.""
The leader of the LMŠ deputies, Brane Golubović, assessed that today's decision means that the democratic pressures on the government have succeeded. According to him, this would not have happened if the government had followed its strategy and bought out York's stake last year when it had an offer. ""However, they speculated and in all probability had some hidden intention to sell Sava Turizem to an investor for whom no one knows what his intentions were,"" he added. SAB President Alenka Bratušek emphasized that this case was an important segment of the Slovenian economy and a unique location that Slovenia could never get back. ""It is true, however, that the agreement has not been signed yet, there are still 62 days until the elections, and all this time we will have to be careful and vigilant so that this government does not prepare another such incident for us,"" she said.
Matej T. Vatovec, the leader of the Left MPs, also pointed out that it was necessary to wait for SSH to actually exercise the pre-emption right. “I wouldn’t have celebrated before because with this government we are used to things being able to change overnight,” he said. According to today's government decision, SSH must ensure a forensic investigation into the operations of both the company and its subsidiaries for a period of ten years before the purchase, within four months of acquiring any capital investment it will obtain from these funds.
The opposition SD, LMŠ, SAB and Levica emphasize that they have no problem with this if there are any suspicions of business irregularities. Hotova also emphasized that it is the owner's responsibility to directly monitor the company's operations. ""If the prime minister thinks that a forensic investigation is necessary, let it happen, we are not going into it, we are going to defend the strategic interests of the state,"" she added. Golubović sees such a move by the government and Prime Minister Janša as a search for ""an apology for his constituents"". Vatovec estimates that ""a whole bunch of forensic investigations should be done"".
In Bled, the owners of tourist facilities are expected to act responsibly
In the light of the sale of York's share in Sava, Turizm Bled points out that they cannot interfere in the proceedings, but emphasizes that they expect the owners to act responsibly from the owners of tourist facilities, both to employees and to the destination itself. They are committed to mutual respect, transparent action and open dialogue. ""Managing one of the most important tourist destinations in this part of Europe and one of the most beautiful in the world is always a joint action of all who live, work or visit the destination as a place for vacation and exploration,"" the acting director of tourism said in a press release. Bled Romana Purkart. As she pointed out, the locals are first and foremost responsible for their place, emphasizing that the people of Bled do not have the privilege to look forward to a single summer, but they must, in all their actions and decisions, influence the development of the place. think of future generations.
""This is exactly what we expect from investors and owners who serve with their accommodation or services in Bled. Bled is a small municipality with less than 8,000 inhabitants, which rightly expects the owners of tourist facilities and services in Bled to cooperate and understand the fragility of its beauty, ""she wrote. Cooperation with the local population, understanding of opportunities and limitations of space, active green and sustainable policy, and above all two-way dialogue between the local community and the owners are, according to Purkart, what should become self-evident.
According to her, the Bled Tourism Public Institution will always be an open interlocutor for everyone - locals, private renters of rooms and apartments, as well as for owners of hotels, restaurants and service providers in Bled. ""We need to talk and find solutions that will enable Bled to develop in all areas,"" she said. ""The decision on who will be the future owners of hotels in elite Bled locations is not influenced by the Bled Tourism Institute and cannot and does not intend to interfere in the proceedings. We clearly emphasize that we expect the owners to act responsibly towards employees and the destination itself. , mutual respect, transparent operation and open dialogue, ""she concluded."

First, the projection of 90,000 deaths due to covida-19 was upsetting, then the warning that omicron is five times worse than other versions of the virus, and doubts about Emma's reports on the effectiveness of booster doses. The first man of the NIJZ is particularly criticized for his work not being professional, but politically motivated. Krek claims the opposite - he says that, unlike his predecessors, he did not come out of politics.","In a short series of articles on 24ur.com, we will look at the combination of science and politics and try to find answers to ethical questions that arise.
Milan Krek was appointed director of the National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) on April 30, 2020, a good month after the outbreak. He replaced acting director Ivan Eržen, who had succeeded the resigned director Nina Pirnat just over a month earlier. From the very beginning, there have been accusations and suspicions that Krek, a specialist in social medicine, represents an extended arm of the ruling policy at the extremely important institute for fighting the epidemic and takes care of the subordination of the profession to the main decision-makers in the country.
Thus, with his statements, which raised a lot of dust, Krek repeatedly made sure that public confidence in the statements and recommendations of the profession decreased, thus contributing to the general dissatisfaction with the measures. In a joint statement, epidemiologists Nina Pirnat, Maja Sočan and Ivan Eržen accused him of discrediting the NIJZ. ""Lies, misleading or inaccurate information cited by Milan Krek are causing further damage to citizens' attitudes towards the epidemic, and consequently greater damage to the health of the population.""
We therefore spoke with the director of the NIJZ about some of his statements and also directly about the alleged political connections.
Projections of more than 90,000 dead
As the head of the NIJZ regional unit in Koper, Krek published the information that in the worst case scenario and if no measures were taken, more than 90,000 people could die due to covida-19. The end of the epidemic is imminent, and the number of people who died with covid-19 is just under 6,500. In September, the three epidemiologists said such claims were unfounded.
Krek explains today that it was a study conducted by three independent modelers. ""We were interested in what this virus actually means if we did not act as a society and individuals, that is, we would not take any action. One said 94,000, the other 110,000 and the third 70,000. We presented their calculations to the public. It was the worst-case scenario. At the same press conference, I also said that under the best-case scenario, we would have 'only' 1,500 dead. We have greatly reduced the number of deaths with measures, but we still have over 6,000. "" Krek points out that they all criticized only one number.
""When we reported this information, problems arose and some from the NIJZ demanded that I stop speaking in public. But our approach in Koper was completely different, more similar to the open Italian approach. We opened the problem, and in Ljubljana it was hiding under the table. ""
""Omicron is five times more dangerous than other versions of the virus""
The coronavirus version of omicron is considered to be significantly more contagious than the previous ones, so it has already become prevalent in most countries around the world. However, although the number of infected people is twice as high as in November last year, the situation in hospitals is stable, and in recent days the number of infections and the number of hospitalized people has been decreasing. There are significantly fewer people in hospitals, and in January the number of deaths from covid-19 was almost half lower than in November, before the advent of omicron in Slovenia. Krek said at the time that ""the devil has taken the joke"", and also warned that omicron is five times more dangerous than other versions of the virus.
The epidemic, in which the profession particularly emphasized that the biggest problem is the pressure on hospitals, is waning after the arrival of omicron. The government announces that it is gradually eliminating epidemiological measures, and the profession estimates that we are coming to a period when covid is becoming an endemic disease.
Krek explains that omicron is more dangerous than previous versions due to the transmission of the infection. The problem is that you have a lot of infections that are difficult to control. At Omicron, we were faced with a new problem, the problem of mass infections, which also led to mass departures to hospitals and quarantines. In many areas, there are problems with the organization of society. In this context, this virus is more severe than others. ""
Krek says the severity of the virus cannot be measured by the number of hospitalizations and deaths alone. ""This virus had another dimension that needed to be talked about. If we just look at hospitals and intensive care units, it's not as severe as the previous one. But it's worse in another context because it has radically interfered with schools. closed, we had the same problem in companies where many people were on sick leave, so the virus must also be seen in the context of what does harm to the economy and society, not just in a strict medical context. ""We are lucky that omicron has only just arrived when many people, especially the elderly, have already been vaccinated and the consequences are milder,"" Krek said.
Doubts about Emma's concerns about booster doses
The director of the NIJZ said in January that he did not trust the European Medicines Agency, which stated in the report concerns about booster doses. Constantly vaccinated, in their opinion, is not a sustainable solution, as we are in the transition from a pandemic to an endemic condition known for colds or flu. At the same time, booster doses not adjusted to the omicron version could weaken the vaccine's immune system, Ema warned. Such doubts, however, suggested a radically different position from our profession, which until recently has persistently called for booster vaccination.
Krek also commented on the skepticism of the European agency and said that he did not believe much. ""The virus still 'found itself' and proved to be even stronger."" He said that it was a media approach and an attempt to liberate people.
Today, he says he expressed skepticism about Emma's report because they used a conditional but did not claim it. ""It's a conditional claim that can't be a fact until it's confirmed by some research.""
Do we have any more information about that now? Krek says we still can’t claim anything because there isn’t enough data. ""A lot of things in science are on shaky ground because there is still too little scientific research and articles. So you have to be very careful with covid. In two years, we learned that it's a virus that likes to surprise. A study from Israel shows a rather small additional benefit of the fourth dose of covid-19 vaccine in protecting against infections with the more contagious coronavirus version of omicron. So skepticism was not unnecessary; we didn't know it at the time. ""
Pirnat led the NIJZ until March 2020, when she resigned after the obvious distrust of the Janša government. Ivan Eržen, who headed the NIJZ between 2013 and 2018, was appointed acting director at the time. At the beginning of the epidemic, he did not hold the position of director for long, as he was publicly critical of government measures. In that period, epidemiologist Sočanova withdrew from the NIJZ expert group. After that, Krek took over the leadership of the NIJZ.
A combination of politics and profession? ""There will be no politics in this house - or there will be no me""
At the beginning of 2020, Krek's statements upset members of the health committee from the SAB, SD, Levice and LMŠ. An open letter was sent to the then Minister of Health, Tomaž Gantar, in which they called for decisive action due to Krek's inappropriate and inadmissible behavior at one of the government's press conferences. According to them, he ruined his reputation and undermined the professionalism of the institute by giving unreasonable and confusing guidelines, so they called on him to resign. Krek rejected the accusations, and the Minister of Health also defended him at the time.
He also vehemently rejects criticism that he allowed the politician to interfere in the independent operation of the NIJZ. Moreover, Krek points out that, unlike his predecessors, he did not come to the institute from politics. ""My job was accepted as political. But Professor Eržen was a state secretary and from there, from a political position, he came to the position of director at the institute. Nina Pirnat was also a state secretary and from that position came to head the NIJZ I did not have any political function and I am not a member of any political party. I jokingly like to say that I am in the 'Public Health' party. There is a big difference compared to my predecessors. At the beginning, I faced a lot of political pressure, but not from the coalition, but from the opposition, which at that time absolutely wanted to portray me as a member of the SDS. ""
""This position was completely political before my performance, so they came to the conclusion that I am also political here, but this is not true. I always fight for this function and all other professional functions to be performed professionally by experts. We need professional institutes. ""When I come to this position, I said that there will be no more politics in this house - or there will be no more of me,"" Krek said.
He emphasized that researchers and directors of institutions should not be politically defined when giving expert opinions. ""I have always adhered to this, I still adhere to it today and I will always adhere to it. Politics must first and foremost listen to the profession. It is true that in the end politics decides because society is so organized. But we politicians must always pour pure wine. I spoke very clearly with the government about the professional positions and starting points and where we are with the epidemic in Slovenia and in the world, based on the knowledge of the NIJZ and ECDC. but she never commanded or suggested how the profession should work. ""
Asked if politics has ever ""run over"" the profession, Krek replies that she has always listened to the covid and that experts have not been overheard. However, he added that representatives of the economy, education, infrastructure and other fields also gave their opinion, ""which is why politics sometimes decided on a modified solution in the end"".
""It wasn't always the way we suggested it, but they accepted some things that were modified after talking to other sectors, but our expert suggestions were also taken into account in the decision. We are a profession, we can't say it's clear red if it is blue.We stick to this and will continue to do so no matter what policy prevails.Professional matters must not be politically colored.Such an approach would be completely wrong in the long run.Professional decisions are professional and for they are the profession, but they cannot stand behind political decisions if they are not in line with the profession, that is crucial. ""
Responsibility for policy decisions is weighed in elections
The director of the institute agrees that science also depends on the economy, funding and, consequently, politics. ""But this does not mean that science must discover a new science that is closer to politics. Science must remain on its professional foundations. I have been working in the field of drugs for 30 years. I am committed to an expert position, whether the party wanted to legalize something or not. I tell them what the danger of legalization is, then they can decide. And that is ultimately their responsibility. ""
Krek goes on to say that it is important for the profession to tell politicians what is professional and to take responsibility for that position. ""And then, of course, politics can also 'run over' science. But then it takes all the responsibility on its shoulders. And that responsibility is then weighed in the election."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/novinar-v-oddaji-med-pogovorom-o-putinu-udaril-proruskega-politika.html,A heated debate over Putin escalated into a brawl: a journalist hit a pro-Russian politician,Journalist Yuri Butusov and pro-Russian politician Nestor Shufrich got into an argument while appearing on a live Ukrainian television show. The heated debate escalated into a physical showdown after Shufric said his party was the second strongest in parliament. Butusov then branded him a traitor and punched him in the face.,"The show on Ukrainian television discussed the situation in Ukraine, and among the guests were, among others, journalist Yuri Butusov and Nestor Shufrich from the pro-Russian opposition party Platform for Life.
Shufrych said his party is the second strongest in the Ukrainian parliament and enjoys much support among the Ukrainian population. He also did not want to condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin's policy toward Ukraine. His statements outraged journalist Butusov, who described the pro-Russian politician as a traitor involved in ""spreading Russian propaganda in Ukraine"". The host of the show tried to calm down the situation, but Butusov approached Shufrič and punched him in the face.
A fight broke out, and with the help of other guests - former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and former President Petro Prosenko - they managed to calm the journalist and politicians down. Šufrič then left the studio for a while, but when he returned, he told the journalist that he was ""an ordinary provocateur""."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/sezigalnice-tudi-v-ljubljani-in-mariboru-cenejse-ogrevanje-ali-strup.html,Incinerators also in Ljubljana and Maribor - cheaper heating or poison?,"Tons and tons of carbon monoxide, ammonia and chromium are rolling out of the chimneys of our incinerators. Where does our waste end up? Not only in landfills in Bosnia and Serbia, but also in our domestic radiators. Did incineration and co-incineration of waste answer the burning question of waste disposal? Do they pose too great a risk to health, drinking water and soil? For three years now, the European Union has been advising members to phase out financial support for waste incineration, which is no longer defined as sustainable. Meanwhile, municipalities in all parts of Slovenia are enthusiastic about building new incinerators. The locations have already been selected, so to speak.","Toplarna Celje alone erupts 360 kg of sulfur oxides, 192 kg of ammonia and as much as 1,200 tons of carbon monoxide every year. ""In ToplarnaT Celje? It is said that it does not release any harmful issues, which makes the heat cheaper, and thank God it is so,"" Celje residents are convinced. ""Celje has always been a healthy city - a zinc factory and all that. No problem,"" they joke ironically.
But the Celje heating plant is a real child against the Salonita Anhovo co-incineration plant, which, according to the ARSO, emits up to 200 times more ammonia and up to 700 times more carbon monoxide every year. ""They can emit up to 5 times more emissions of toxic substances, mercury and heavy metals per ton of waste,"" explains Miha Stegel of the channel's civil initiative Danes, which won last year in the fight for independence of the Anhov waterworks from the cement plant.
The Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning did not provide any interlocutor for our broadcast, saying that the decree has not yet been adopted and that the solutions are still being prepared and are being coordinated with all stakeholders. This is proof that in fifteen or twenty years - as far as Slovenian politics is concerned with waste incineration - both the left and right governments, as well as the current one, have learned nothing, said Uroš Macerl from the Vesna party, recipient of the Goldman Award for Trbovlje Lafarge and other incinerators. It seems that the public debate will take place only after the regulation has been adopted. Therefore, we also asked dr. Milan Brvar from the Center for Clinical Toxicology and Pharmacology, University Medical Center Ljubljana.
Clients of measurements also polluters themselves
There are two types of waste incineration and co-incineration - we get rid of them and also obtain thermal energy. This is the case, at least in public heating plants, such as Celje. Waste from abroad is also burned in Anhovo - is this a business? ""One has to be aware that incineration always represents emissions of toxic substances - and the most absurd thing is that a huge proportion of the waste is foreign - it's actually a business.""
The Celje heating plant is constantly monitored, and the data are also available online. Many others are different - doubts about the impartiality of the measurements are raised by the fact that many polluters order and pay for the monitoring themselves. Trbovlje-based Lafarge measured emissions for five years with uncalibrated equipment - this was not detected by either the inspection or the ARSO. No one answered. ""It should be in the interest of the state to protect all citizens,"" Stegel added.
Toxic emissions not only pollute the air - they settle on vegetables, pass into soil and drinking water - and thus permanently into the food chain. These are various dioxins, furans, heavy metals, said Dr. Milan Brvar - people in the vicinity of incinerators are therefore more likely to suffer from cancers of the lymph nodes, intestinal lungs and others, such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. He proposes that this regulation include the suitability of the proposed site among the criteria for the selection of concessionaires, as not all sites are suitable for waste incineration, such as closed basins that are poorly ventilated and those with a temperature reversal, such as the Ljubljana Basin. we haven't seen the sun for weeks and the air is very polluted due to just over 100,000 cars that also emit benzene into the air, which causes blood cancer. Therefore, it is not appropriate to incinerate an additional 100 thousand tons of waste here. Highly populated areas are also not suitable, because this release exposes a huge number of people, as well as agricultural areas.
Our limit values ​​are looser than European ones
""Limit values ​​are a political agreement,"" Eco Circle activists say. The values ​​in European regulations are significantly stricter than those issued in environmental permits to co-incineration companies. Experts and environmentalists are clear, control should be tightened, the permissible limits should be lowered - these are even looser in co-incineration plants, such as in Anhovo. The tax is paid by the surrounding residents - with their health, but also with their lives. In Ljubljana alone, polluted air causes hundreds of deaths every year.
And while the European guidelines on incineration no longer consider sustainable waste management, Celje insists - the benefits of incineration far outweigh the impact on the environment. They are even planning to expand their capacities. ""We have a very good experience in Celje, which actually saves a lot of energy that we would otherwise have to buy,"" says Celje Mayor Bojan Šrot proudly. ""Maximizing production also means a great impact on the environment,"" the residents of Celje are cautious. ""Those responsible must also be very interested in this.""
The smoke from the incinerators and the ordinance are a veil of secrecy
Meanwhile, the Minister of the Environment, Andrej Vizjak, says that we just need thermal energy in populated areas. However, it could produce electricity elsewhere, according to dr. Brvar, as district heat is not the only way to heat homes.
To solve such a problem, the process must be transparent, public, open, and all data clear. In the case of the present decree of the Ministry of the Environment, the procedure directly calls for a corruption case, in fact we do not even know the exact amount of Slovenian waste, and we are planning four incinerators. It is not known exactly what their capacity will be if we burn too much waste, it is like hanging a noose around your neck. The decree is being signed for thirty years, and some politicians, in addition to all Slovenian citizens, will sign for all unborn children that Slovenians will not treat waste differently for thirty years than today. According to dr. Brvar.
If we have 100 units of waste for which there is no other solution than incineration, we should set up incinerators for a maximum of 50 units, and the remaining 50 should remain as stimulation, which we must achieve in the shortest possible time by redesigning products, reusable products and recycling, to decompose into several different raw materials - incineration is nothing but the destruction of valuable resources that Europe does not have, explains Macerl. The way in which waste is incinerated in Slovenia and in which incineration is controlled is completely uncontrolled. Environmental organizations have been pointing this out for years. Slovenian legislation is written in such a way that polluters can control themselves, so we cannot expect good control, says Macerl. Slovenian legislation also allows significantly higher limit values ​​than European legislation.
Bargains between politics and investors - will TEŠ repeat itself?
When Europe started to abandon coal, we started building TEŠ 6 in Slovenia, which many also call a monument to corruption, and now all citizens are paying for it. Excessive emissions of harmful substances into the environment require us to pay environmental fines to the European Union. Macerl claims that we are following the same path with (co) incinerators, as agreements between capital and investors and politicians are taking place in the background. We cannot know what they are talking about, and in the first moment, when the citizens do not know the background to such an important decision, all the lights must be turned on.
The Medical Chamber sent its comments on the decree, but in response they received only a message about the meeting the next day, which did not say who will attend and in what capacity. They asked for a more appropriate date, but have not received a response so far (February 17, op. Cit.) - nor has they responded to their proposals for amendments to the regulation.
Unburned waste is worth much more
If they explain to us for twenty years that nothing can be done by reducing waste, and if they repeat this long enough, nothing will be done, Macerl is picturesque. We also have half a million and larger communities in Europe, which have excellent results in waste management and achieve significantly less waste than we have here. With its small size, Slovenia is ideal to be an example of how, as a country as a whole, to move to a zero waste system. Some Slovenian municipalities are also achieving good results and we must understand that efforts must be focused on product transformation, which also brings new jobs, and when we do not incinerate waste, we will save the most. Unburned and reused waste has a much higher value than that obtained by incineration. Macerl is still critical of the Slovenian state doing nothing to move in this direction.
Incineration and co-incineration - waste disposal or business?
Proponents claim that incinerators are common in Europe, that it is a technologically highly controlled process and that Slovenia must be self-sufficient in this area as well. We have a big problem with excess waste, exports are very expensive, and burning would be welcome to a certain extent, given the current oil prices on the world market. Politicians and the investor see incineration as a business.
Although health and well-being must be weighed against incineration and co-incineration - heating plants provide cheap heat for district heating while also solving the waste issue - Anhovo doubts that the benefits outweigh the quality of the living environment: ""The cement plant 80 people are employed and 5,000 people live in the Channel Valley. Long-term human health is being sacrificed - the wider valley. ""
There is also an important difference in whether the incinerators will be public or privately owned. If it were public and had the best possible technology, incineration would be as expensive as it should be, as everyone would try to produce as little waste as possible. If the incineration is privately owned, the interest will be the opposite - the highest possible profit, which will bring as much incinerated waste as possible in the least strict way. But this is not just about solving the problem of waste - incineration of those imported from abroad is primarily about profit.
Response from Salonit Anhovo

Salonit Anhovo subsequently responded to the statements of the Danes Anhovo Initiative by explaining that Miha Stegl's statements from the Danes Anhovo Civil Initiative are not true, as they comply with European limits set for cement plants, which have different values ​​than incinerators due to different technologies. however, the difference is expected to arise only for some parameters associated with higher temperatures in the process (for organic carbon, sulfur dioxide and NOx nitrogen oxides).

They further claim that the burning of raw materials imported from abroad is not a business, as the burning of fuels imported from Italy was defined as an alternative, and that last year they generated most of Slovenia's waste. Salonit disputes Anhovo's claim that 80 people work in the cement plant and 5,000 suffer from the consequences of the releases - they claim that the Salonit group employs 360 people and that they ensure health safety by using the latest technologies.

They also state that the effects of these activities on health have not been detected, but add that due to the high burden of mesothelioma in the Channel Valley, the burden of cancer in both sexes is higher than elsewhere in the Gorizia region and Slovenia."

The battle against the controversial water law and for the redefinition of sexual violence and rape are just two projects that she publicly exposed and gained a number of critics along with her supporters, but failed to silence her. We talked with Nika Kovač, who recently became the Slovene of the Year, about how each individual can assert their vote in an election year, about what young people want, how it is possible to overcome political poles through cooperation. As well as whether she is tempted by politics and whether she would go for coffee with her great critic - Prime Minister Janez Janša.","Critics of Nika Kovač and the March 8 Institute, her work, often ridicule her for her appearance, image, accuse her of privileges, family history, and often publicly humiliate her. At first she acted brave, but at one point she had to admit that it affected her: “These are really very ugly things, these are offensive things and these are like bullies in elementary school, they affect you and their purpose is to make you they shut up. "" Nika Kovač, who does not let herself be silenced, also says that people often mistakenly think that she is extremely brave, but in reality she is afraid of many things: ""Let's say I can't watch horror movies because I don't sleep for seven days. And I don't like flying. ""
Following the resounding projects of the Institute on March 8, the title of Slovene Woman of the Year was recently brought to the center of attention. How did you experience this recognition, and especially the comments that followed. Among other things, the Prime Minister Janez Janša spoke up and ""estimated"" that instead of those who sacrifice for others, we choose those who are ""the most annoying"" for the personalities of the year?
The title means a lot to me, it seems to me to communicate that people stand behind me, the team and the idea of ​​the March 8 Institute, which is the idea of ​​spreading hope, solidarity and building change for a fairer society. And given the many pressures that this authority is constantly exerting on individuals whose purpose is to overthrow you personally, I experienced the award as a message from a large group of people that I am not alone and that we are not alone. And at the same time we communicate to each other - hey, we are a community, we are here, we are voices that want a better world. And that is why it is a great consolation and great hope for me.
I expected the comments and attacks that followed. My first thought when I found out was - but now it will be ""stable"". But at the same time, I felt peace - both in the collective and in myself, thanks to the fact that the wider community is behind us. I see more and more that these attacks are actually the cry of a frightened man who is afraid of losing his position and power. A man who stayed at some other time and has no answers for the future. All this aggression says the most about him. And if the Prime Minister thinks that harassment is a fight to redefine rape, a fight against water privatization, a fight for the community, then my message is that I will continue to harass. And I'm proud of that.
Many are silenced by attacks, especially if they are so personal, if they involve loved ones. Why aren't you?
Because attacks and discrediting are a mechanism of power aimed at silencing critical voices. And I am aware of that. Attacks have intensified over the past year and a half. At first I tried to react to them with humor, I tried to prove that they don’t move me at all. Then I was given extra strength by this distance that allows me to stay in the US. Namely, the fact that I know that I have a wide group of friends here who support me, the awareness that I am part of another, international community. Thanks to this power, at some point I decided to talk about the very concrete effects of such action. I think the worst thing that can happen when attacks happen is that you have a feeling that you have to be quiet so that the attacks don’t escalate further. This is a pattern of victimization of bullying, which I found important to break and also to show what the material effects of such attacks are. Most frightening, however, is that anyone who utters a critical word against authority can become a target. Look at what is happening to Iasi Jenullu, a father of two, a self-employed artist, after expressing his opinion at protests? Above him now hangs the threat of enormous sums. All these are inadmissible encroachments on a person, and it is right that when this happens to someone, we say - we are all Jaša, we are all Sanja, we are all Ivan Gale - and we expose these things, condemn them and show solidarity.
How has the distance of New York changed your view of Slovenia?
I always emphasize that I adore Slovenia, I love it madly, because we have a welfare state, public health and education. We have laid the foundations of social solidarity, and above all we have people who are willing to connect and work for the community. Proof of this are the fire brigades, the work of various humanitarian organizations, the success of campaigns such as the one for little Kris, proof of this is, after all, how we connected in the referendum on water ... We also have a constitution that sets as a fundamental principle we are a welfare state, it guarantees free decision-making on the birth of children, the right to drinking water and mechanisms for political participation, it gives us, otherwise too limited, the opportunity to call referendums, propose laws.
What we have is not self-evident. There is no such thing in America, my classmates from India, Africa and the Pacific do not know that. Therefore, on the one hand, I feel extremely grateful and sympathetic to our community, the constitution, the people. On the other hand, I am more aware than ever that our country is not equal to our government, and that the current government is in fact the one that divides, breaks, intimidates, destroys the foundations of the welfare state, privatizes public health, politicizes education and it subordinates the judiciary and the police - such forms of government must always be fought against.
There will be no shortage of opportunities for everyone to fight for their ideals this year, we are in the ""year of elections"". How should people tackle this battle?
Our common guideline must be content, what kind of future we want and the awareness that the future is in our hands, that our vote in elections counts and means something. The change of power is just the beginning, the first effect, it will be crucial what the policies of the next government will be. Before the election campaign begins on March 8, the institute will present laws against harmful measures taken by the authorities. values ​​of the next authority. It is crucial for us which parties will commit to supporting the law and with what programs they are going to the polls.
Above all, we want people to participate in the democratic process, because that is the only way we can create a more just and equal society. We won the water referendum because each individual acted as a campaign organizer. This means that he brought five more acquaintances to the polls, printed leaflets, distributed them around, addressed his relatives ... And that is exactly what we must do this year in all the upcoming elections. We need to talk about what kind of future we want and behave as if we are the ones co-creating the campaigns. I think the following is especially important: the authorities are changing, the percentage of parties is changing, but people can stay active and establish a new way of political activity in Slovenia, where we will demand and get more from politics, where we will not vote for one and get another. , where people will always be present in the equation of thinking of politicians and the consequences they will experience if they act against the interests of the people. This is a very important step.
With the Institute's projects on March 8, you have repeatedly managed to address a group that politicians rarely manage to convince - young people. You yourself are a representative of the young generation. What is it that awakens young people?
I think the biggest problem in the past when it comes to young people has been that most parties have tried to address them patronizingly, through quick, likeable slogans. They felt they had to convince them with some “cool” videos, with some entertainment, they didn’t treat them as people with views and expectations and they didn’t give them clear commitments and clear content. What the referendum has shown, as well as the campaign to redefine rape and many other actions, is that young people, of course, want to be involved in the decision-making process, know how to use the processes offered by the constitution, but must be taken seriously, consistently. content and with some commitments.
This time, too, the case of the draft law against harmful measures being prepared at the Institute and the Voice of the People initiative shows that opposition and new parties committed to certain topics are aware that politics is a two-way process where they are not isolated. from us in the “big house” but they will have to work with us. I am convinced that many more of us will come to the polls this time.
There are calls to move from campaigns related to ideology and the people who marked the previous elections to substantive debates, even President Borut Pahor. What topics do we need to discuss before charting the direction of the country's post-war development?
With the president, he probably has a very different understanding of what content is based on his Instagram profile and performance. I understand the content as conversations about the future. My generation, as well as the elders who write to us at the Institute, do not want discussions about the past. This is something that is behind us and of course affects where we are. But they want a clear and determined view of tomorrow and they want to have a sense that they can act in the present. Building the future is possible only through concrete questions - where will we live, will everyone be able to get their own apartment, will we have access to unsustainable jobs, decent wages, sick leave, leave, what will we do for those living below the poverty line? who will have the most, we will contribute a fair share, we will prevent the privatization of public health and strengthen it, we will leave the next generations a planet where we can live ... These are direct questions of this moment, questions of how to build the future, these must be fundamental issues of these elections.
What should be the role of women in this context of change? Is there still untapped potential when it comes to women in politics?
Whenever women are underrepresented in a system or party, this speaks to a broader problem. The lack of women in positions is due to the fact that there is some inequality that is embedded in the foundations of the system, organization and way of working. To address this, I think it is crucial that we set up structures that operate on the principles of justice and equality. I often give the example that the position of director of a multinational is taken over by a woman who continues the practices of brutal cost-cutting and redundancies does not change anything. At the March 8 Institute, we are predominantly a female collective, but we never think about our gender in our work. We work on the content, we move on. It seems important to me to point out that I have completely foreign practices that we can see in politics around the world, where the mere fact that someone is a woman is exploited to score political points. You say - it's time to get a woman, we need women because they are kinder, more compassionate, thoughtful ... But this is nonsense. For me, the important thing is what someone stands for and how they have acted in the past, what matters is what someone represents - not their gender.
But what is the profile of a politician who is a good partner, an interlocutor for citizens, civil society?
The basis is that political parties must not be patronizing and instrumentalist towards civil society. Civil society must be seen as an equal partner who is listened to and to whom you have an honest, direct relationship and commitment. All too often it happens that when civil society problematizes something, politics waves its hand. And that’s what all the authorities have been doing so far. On the other hand, I notice the frequent mistake of civil society. It happens that when politics works correctly, when it listens, when it responds to comments, it is not said, exposed and praised. A reciprocal, correct attitude seems to me the right way forward.
Is it possible? The company seems to be extremely fragmented…
I think our society is much more homogeneous and united in what it wants and expects than it seems if you listen to politicians in parliament. I believe that we have a very clear consensus that we are a society based on solidarity, that we want public and free education, public and free health care, a culture of dialogue, that work must be respected, that we care about the community and we want a decent life for all. It seems to me that we forget this too often and don’t talk about it. When we work, we are always surprised at the Institute that voters of all parties work with us. They tell us that because we work for people and for the community, and they are with us because the content is close to them.
And this is exactly what I think is crucial - to look for common ground, not to give in, but at the same time be aware that people want a decent life in the first place. Divisions are often artificially created and are in the service of instilling fear and fear in the current government, which we do not really need.

And if I point out a practical example - one of our high-profile projects was the campaign to redefine the crime of rape, where Iva Dimic, MP from Nova Slovenija, a party with which we fundamentally disagree and always problematize its harmful effects, gave us a very strong hand. But in this case, however, they were a clear and correct ally, and with this action, it also turned out that there is a broader consensus on the topics. The fact that differences are created artificially in our political space instead of working on what we have in common is another proof that a large part of the actors are not driven by people's interests, but by their interests in chairs, money and power, and importantly, the interests of capital. This is the case, for example, with supplementary health insurance, the abolition of which is supported by virtually everyone, and after almost twenty years of political promises, we are still paying bills. We need to look for what we have in common and build on it, while at the same time standing very clearly against authoritarianism and particular interests, this seems to me to be the right path.
How did you and MP Ivo Dimic find your way to each other?
At the Institute, we always work on the basis of clear substantive principles, on which we do not compromise and do not accept compromises. And when I talk about the content of our demand that we must change the law, that all sexual acts without consent will be punished, that it will no longer be an outdated requirement that the victim must physically resist the perpetrator, that this is necessary because 75 percent of rape victims I spoke clearly at the meeting of the Education Committee chaired by the Member of Parliament, I made it clear what the victims of sexual harassment and violence were experiencing, and I was very clear about what could be done to protect them, and what we expect from politicians in this regard.
As I was leaving the hall, she came after me and said that she had heard what I was saying and that she understood that it was the job of politics to speak out on this topic. Nataša Sukič from the Left also joined, proposing an extended decision, and it showed how zero tolerance for harassment and sexual violence in this country is the subject of a common consensus. This seems right to me, because every victim must feel that she has a political option behind her in the National Assembly.
Is such a concrete, focused on a specific topic cooperation, perhaps with Janez Janša?
The deputies of the SDS party have already participated correctly in the battle for a new source of drinking water for Anhova and in the redefinition of the crime of rape. However, in a broader sense, this party acts to suppress all critical voices.
When we had the government of Marjan Šarc, I often said that there is no difference between the central governments that follow the neoliberal agenda and the neoliberal government of Janez Janša. Well, time has shown that I was wrong. The current government is authoritarian, intimidating, selling off. And although we were one of the loudest voices against some moves of the government of Marjan Šarc, I can have a correct relationship with him when it comes to substantive issues, and with Janez Janša this is absolutely not possible. And this is a big difference between the two social realities that we will decide on in elections. One is committed to the fundamental values ​​of a democratic community, the possibility of dialogue, the other unfortunately not.
So you can't imagine sitting together for coffee?
No. (laughter)
Do you think that Slovenes as a society - not just politics - understand well enough the role that civil society plays in a healthy democracy?
For me, civil society means action that understands that politics is a common thing, that concrete decisions affect concrete people and people who know they can demand change - and also connect in the things they want to change, and then change is achieved. .
In fact, we have learned a great deal from some of the past struggles of past generations, and I like to highlight the battle for the right to freely decide on the birth of children and to enshrine it in the constitution. So we know examples of active posture and active action. What I think is important to emphasize is that everyone can really contribute their part. Every job is honorable and together we can achieve change. That is our mission.
So you are not (yet) tempted by even more decision-making threads in your hands? However, are you also thinking about moving into politics?
Immediately after winning the referendum, this started to be talked about, even though we never thought about it. Everything was unusual, we fell in the referendum almost by accident, after a successful fight to redefine the crime of rape, Alenka from Smetumet called us that environmental organizations need help in the fight to protect water. We did not expect to win the referendum, to reach a very very high quorum in the middle of the summer seemed impossible to us. We were ready for defeat. Then all of a sudden it happened that a lot of hope was projected in us, a desire to create a client out of it. But we stopped these projections at the same time. I think setting up a political party is a complex process where you have to know very clearly what your content is, you have to know very clearly how to address people, how to create a community and how to act. This is a skill that needs to be taken seriously and with full responsibility. We consciously insist on a different path, we enter the sphere of politics every day, but in a different, unique way. It seems to us that we can do more and better the way we work now. Let’s stand up for those who don’t have a voice, let’s jump when we need to jump in and build community and alliances for the next substantive battles.
You say - politics must be approached with all seriousness and responsibility. Do you have a feeling that we sometimes tackle it ""for fun""?
Policy should be a place to design actions that benefit communities. We understand too little that this is a collective process. Exchanging opinions whose goal should be to improve things, not to show how you are smarter than another or your opponent to humiliate. Citizens must not be excluded from this process, we must be by their side and use the levers with which we take political parties by the word and direct their actions.
We all see that the current convocation of the National Assembly has completely moved away from what politics should be.
In the last year and a half, it has become especially clear that the government has begun to act vulgarly. It is very transparent in that it shares chairs where more than content and knowledge counts which party you are in. No one is ashamed to write very disgusting things about people who are, after all, citizens of this country. The level of what is expected of politics has really fallen.
How much, I found out with my arrival in the US, where I was actually surprised that Trump’s exchange with Biden, who doesn’t attack and insult people on Twitter, actually had quite a few consequences. There is some peace, even though people have different views. It was only then that I realized how much we have become immune to having a Prime Minister who obviously believes that half or three quarters of Slovenia does not deserve a decent life.
But how do you take a step back in such a situation, how do you “raise the bar” again?
It will be the task of all of us to demand this. Our job is to strongly condemn all offensive attacks and creative action, hence the left. I hope, however, that even the newcomers who come have enough reflection to know that it is necessary to set a limit and adhere to certain standards. However, establishing this minimum of democratic space is just the beginning. The new government will have to start acting differently and create a fairer and more equitable future with concrete policies. Here, too, they can learn something from Joe Biden, who after the first successful measures failed to provide what people expected from him: higher minimum wages, maternity leave, lower drug prices ... The people of Slovenia expect and deserve the next government more.
You said earlier - young people are interested in the future. What kind of future of Slovenia do you want?
The kind where we don’t need the March 8th Institute.

Kennedy in connection with the Brazilian singer,"Conor Kennedy, who was in a relationship with singer Taylor Swift a decade ago, is happy in love again. After breaking up with Avo Dash, the daughter of a well-known producer, he fell in love with Brazilian star singer Giulio Be.","Conor Kennedy, 27, fell in love again after breaking up with Avo Dash. The grandson of the late American politician Robert F. Kennedy first appeared in public with the daughter of producer Damon Dash in June last year, after they had been in a relationship for several months. After the end of the relationship, he found happiness in love with the Brazilian singer.
Giulia Bourguignon Marinho, who appears under the name Giulia Be, hinted at a love affair with Conor on social media. On Valentine’s Day, she posted some telling photos on Instagram.
Kennedy broke up with Dash last year when he enrolled at Georgetown Law University, while Ava began studying at a college in California. For a couple who previously lived together in the Hamptons area and Los Angeles, this is a fateful distance. Shortly after the breakup, the American media reached rumors of a new relationship between the son of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Mary Richardson: '' Conor and Giulia are secretly seeing each other, but officially they are already a couple. She lives in Rio, but they spend time together in Malibu. '' The Brazilian singer and songwriter has been nominated for Latin Grammys in the past, and has 2.3 million fans on Instagram. At the end of 2020, the music platform Spotify announced that her song Menina Solta was the most played song in the Portuguese language in Portugal.
The Brazilian is not the first singer with whom Conor is in a love affair. The son of a lawyer and environmental activist, he has been in a relationship with singer Taylor Swift in the past. The couple spent the summer of 2012 together, and photographers captured them in the lens at Kennedy's estate in Cape Cod. The star also bought a property in the Hyannis Port area for just over four million in a time of great love for being as close to their residences as possible.
Kennedy and Swift broke up in October 2012, and after the end of the relationship, the musician released the song Begin Again on the album Red, which is supposed to be about the former chosen one. She later sold the house on Cape Cod for almost a million euros more."
https://www.24ur.com/kaj-se-dogaja-s-preiskavami-zoper-ministra-pocivalska-snezica-pivcevo-in-z-grozilnimi-pismi.html,"What is happening with the investigations against Minister Počivalšek, Snežič, Pivčeva and the threatening letters?","Given that it has been rumored for some time that the criminal investigation into the allegedly controversial purchase of protective equipment, in which Economy Minister Počivalšek is also suspected of criminal offenses, has been completed, we asked the National Investigation Office whether the case has been completed. We were told that they could only confirm that the NPU investigators were still conducting pre-trial proceedings.","We also checked with the Specialized State Prosecutor's Office, which leads and directs the investigation. ""We would like to inform you that we have not yet received a criminal complaint and explain that all tasks related to the guidelines of the State Prosecutor's Office have been completed."" In translation - for prosecutors, the case is closed, as investigators are supposed to do everything that the prosecution ordered them to do. So where are the results? Where did it get stuck?
We also asked the National Bureau of Investigation when the investigation is expected to be completed, before the elections or after April. ""The duration of pre-trial proceedings depends on the scope of operational activities to be carried out in such criminal investigations in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act - from gathering information and documentation, obtaining findings from other bodies, investigative actions, financial investigations, reviewing seized electronic data and documents, and all evidence must be properly secured, reviewed and evaluated, ""Maja Ciperle Adlešič from the Police replied at the end of last month. In the past few days, we are once again checking with the prosecutor's office to see if they may have already received any mail from the NPU. ""Nothing,"" they reply. Why the case is standing and what exactly is going on with the investigation at the NPU is thus unknown.
At the same time, the chief investigator in this case was transferred to Tacen, where he now leads a working group for the backlogs produced by the Ljubljana Police Administration. This was also pointed out by former Director General of the Police Tatjana Bobnar, who was questioned last Friday before a parliamentary commission investigating suspicions of political interference in the work of the Police. ""The backlog working group is now led by an NPU investigator who has been withdrawn, so to speak, from the investigation into the purchase of protective equipment. It is not known whether this is a reward or a punishment for him?"" So if they withdraw the criminals from the investigation against Minister Počivalšek, one would expect that they are no longer needed because the case is over.
In January, we also checked for the investigation led by the NPU over the SRIPT affair, where former Minister of Agriculture Aleksandra Pivec is among the suspects. The Ministry of the Economy announced the crimes in this story at the end of 2019, and the results of the criminal investigation are still not available. Adlešič replied that the pre-criminal proceedings at the NPU were still ongoing regarding the use of European funds and that they could not provide more information to protect the interest of the proceedings. The investigation into the allegedly controversial transactions of tax advisor Rok Snežič, which was launched by the National Investigation Office in 2018, has not been completed, and after four years, the results are still not available. Meanwhile, Interior Minister Aleš Hojs last week praised the new head of the NPU, Petra Grah Lazar, at the commission of inquiry in the National Assembly. Do they have two types of drawers on the NPU?
Catastrophic leak of confidential information
Interior Minister Aleš Hojs, who likes to explain the leak of police information to other media houses, is silent about the party portals where he was the director and where they actually publish confidential information. He did the same before the commission of inquiry last week, when he was asked at a hearing in the National Assembly how it is possible that information about house searches at the Minister of Economy Počivalšek appeared in public the day before. Which, by the way, happened for the first time in the history of the Slovenian Police. Minister Hojs said: ""I was extremely dissatisfied with the information coming out in public. This is not the first time, obviously our Police is at such a low level of information protection. However, it is understandable if you have a person who is According to my information, she was in a partnership with a POP TV journalist, where we found out where the matter would take place. "" The minister thus spread false information and misled again, as we never announced on POP TV who would have the house search the next day. The fact that the house searches of Minister Počivalšek will take place the day before was revealed on the portal, which is co-owned by deputies from the largest government party.
The news that the Police had discovered the perpetrator who sent threatening letters and bullets to politicians could first be read in the pro-government media, where it was clear from the text who he was. Certainly, the alleged perpetrator identified himself. We published the story later on our website. The true dimensions of this information, however, became apparent only later, when it became clear that the investigation had not yet been completed at all, that there had been no house searches, let alone criminal charges. According to our information, the investigators were shocked because the information went public. After two weeks, not a word about the results of the investigation, suspects or charges. The police have remained silent and do not answer questions. ""In connection with your questions, we can only answer that an intensive criminal investigation is underway and that we cannot provide more information due to the interest of the investigation,"" said Drago Menegalija.
Speaking at a hearing last weekend, Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry Chairman Rudi Medved told Minister Hojs that a message in the pro-government media had compromised the investigation and probably prevented even house searches. The house search at Počivalšek was also compromised, at that time the head of the NPU was Igor Lamberger. There is a suspicion - as investigators, according to our information, detected several things that indicated that the suspects, for example before the house search at Rok Snežič, were informed in advance that they would be visited by the Police. Due to this, according to our information, the head of the NPU Petra Grah Lazar is also in the pre-criminal proceedings at the prosecutor's office. She admitted to the commission of inquiry that she knew Rok Snežič personally.
However, internal security proceedings at the Police are not yielding any results and it is not even revealed whether anyone is carrying confidential court orders out of the house before criminals reach the suspects. Even now, internal controls are said to have been ordered due to the launch of data on the discovery of an alleged sender of threatening letters to politicians. The police do not answer our questions as to whether this is true and whether the director of the Criminal Police Administration, Vojko Urbas, should really take care of it. However, the parliamentary commission, which is investigating possible suspicions of political interference in the work of the Police, will also take a closer look at this matter, Medved announced. As he says, it is unusual that this information was found in the pro-government media even before the house was searched by the suspect. He wonders who is interested in this: ""Only ruthless authoritarian rule abuses its supporters to threaten itself with death and, of course, uses it to deal with political opponents. We may wonder if we are affected because it is clearly the ruling politics the manipulation upset the citizens and they wanted to make a victim out of themselves. They dumped the man they first abused, but now things are going on in a way that raises even more questions. ""
At the hearing before the commission of inquiry, another lie was confirmed about the alleged irregularities in the apparent purchase of illicit drugs. A criminal investigator at the National Bureau of Investigation got involved in the story. At an extraordinary session of the National Assembly, MP Zmago Jelinčič explained that an NPU employee allegedly borrowed six thousand euros from a person for the apparent purchase of illicit drugs, but that he did not want to return the money. When asked by Predrag Bakovič from the Social Democrats, the Minister of the Interior replied that this story was true. Although the Police replied that this event did not happen at all and denied Jelinčič's allegations. Minister Hojs reiterated: ""The testimony of the directly injured party in this case confirms the truth of the event, that the NPU employee borrowed money in the amount of six thousand euros from him, which was intended for the apparent purchase of illicit drugs. He never had that money. returned. ""
At the hearing of Hojs, MP Bakovič also asked about this story, what the investigation showed in the end. The minister had no choice but to admit that the information was untrue. Of course, there is no excuse for criminals. Some even receive criminal charges. Supervisors are also involved in the allegedly controversial practices, detecting ""professional errors"" on the basis of documents that do not exist. Reports state that someone had a pet search initiative in the drawer for six months. They are talking about a document that does not exist and pre-trial proceedings that have not even begun. And because the supervisors find a document that was not there, the head of the NPU informs the Sector for Internal Investigations and Integrity to arrange for a criminal complaint for negligent work in the service. The prosecution, of course, dismisses the complaint in a fast-track procedure because it is completely unfounded. However, the Interior Minister also explained the document, which does not exist, to the members of the commission of inquiry last week, and pointed out that five months is really too long to take the draft initiative for a house search from the drawer."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/poziv-k-locitvi-politike-od-upravljanja-druzb-v-drzavni-lasti.html,A call for the separation of politics from the governance of state-owned companies,"The Association of Supervisors of Slovenia and the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption sent a call to political parties to establish a social consensus in the field of corporate governance. In their view, this is a good time to make appropriate commitments in this area to urgently separate politics from the governance of state-owned companies.","According to the chairman of the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption (CCP), Robert Šumi, they sent a joint call to political parties because they want ""this area to be highlighted as one of the most important in terms of further running the country"". ""We call on all parties to commit to separating politics from the management of state-owned companies,"" he told a news conference in Ljubljana today.
According to him, professionalism, transparency and traceability of procedures should be achieved in appointments, and experts with a high level of integrity should be placed in leading positions. Therefore, together with the Association of Supervisors of Slovenia (ZNS), they call on the authorities to respect the law, to change systems thoughtfully and professionally, to rely on ability, experience and independence in staffing, and to implement a protocol for disclosing pressure and sanctions.
As the president of the ZNS, Gorazd Podbevšek, summed up, the government must first abide by the law, and the system does not have to be demolished every time, but must be upgraded, relying on knowledge and experience. ""The fact that there are political quotas is necessary and important, but it is wrong when discussions are extended to functions in the economy. Companies, both state and other, need to be staffed according to certain standards,"" he stressed.
They call on politicians to strictly enforce the asset manager's rules. ""The Slovenian State Holding (SDH) is intended to be a bulwark between politics and the economy, or to translate legitimate political interests into professional decisions about companies,"" he said. good. A protocol is also available for this, which helps members of supervisory boards and management boards to expose pressures.
The call also highlighted the commitment to sanction and take responsibility. ""Members of supervisory boards and management boards that take into account interests other than the company's interests are too often sanctioned,"" Podbevšek said, although rules for this already exist. According to him, we also have all the mechanisms at our disposal for the fact that violations are sanctioned by the holders of political power, so that those who abuse it are held accountable with property or criminal penalties.
Šumi assessed that the political culture and the culture of governance of state-owned companies are not at the desired level. ""The Commission has been noticing this for decades, no matter who is in government, and this has been especially evident recently. Instead of making progress, we are seeing a step backwards. This should not be the reality of any current policy,"" he said. .
We have a legal framework for sanctions in the country, but in practice, according to him, we do not see this often. There is no appropriate supervisory institution in the field of incorrect or inappropriate staffing. ""The Commission has limited powers, but has made a number of recommendations to the government and ministries in the past, but these are often ignored,"" he added, stressing that a commitment to sanction derogations was also necessary.
Podbevšek also emphasized that the case law in this area is not good, and the problem is not only in the judiciary, but also in the fact that such proceedings are too often initiated: ""If there is no plaintiff, there is no judge."" Shumi added that the commission does not receive many applications. The CCP handles any application, even if it is anonymous. However, there is none of them regarding staffing at Pošta Slovenije, the president of the KPK added."

""Unfortunately, there is a difference between what Russia is saying and what it is doing. What we are seeing is not a significant withdrawal,"" he said. The union's defense ministers, meanwhile, said in the meantime that they would examine the possibility of a longer-term strengthening of forces in the east. Russia's security council, however, sees the United States as a threat.","According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, military units that took part in the announced exercises on the Crimean peninsula are retreating to the interior of Russia. Russia has previously completed military exercises near the eastern Ukrainian border, and the withdrawal of its troops began just around the date when Washington predicted that the alleged Russian invasion would begin.
But Blinken said on the contrary, the forces that are supposed to lead the attack on Ukraine remain on the border. Therefore, the threat of invasion remains real, Blinken said. Russia also announced on Tuesday the first withdrawal of its troops from Ukraine's borders.
Blinken added that Russian President Vladimir Putin could decide to attack at any time, today, tomorrow or next week, he has forces ready to put pressure on Ukraine. He called for a diplomatic solution, adding: ""We are ready for diplomacy. We are ready for aggression. We are ready for both.""
Similarly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said today that he saw no signs of the withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border. As he said in a statement to the British BBC at a military training ground in western Ukraine, ""we have not yet seen any withdrawal, but only heard about it"". As the forces withdraw, “everyone will be able to see it,” not just the military, he explained.
The White House, meanwhile, announced that US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will be heard on the phone today. He was on a visit to Russia on Tuesday, where he met with Putin and visited Ukraine the day before. Scholz was on a visit to the White House last week.
He will then examine the possibilities for a longer-term strengthening of forces in the east
NATO's defense ministers today ordered Ukraine to identify options for a longer-term strengthening of Allied forces on the eastern wing due to the Russian threat. A set of options is expected in a few weeks. Russia's opposition to the security regime in Europe is a ""new reality"", said Alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
The defense ministers have instructed the relevant military services to identify options for a longer-term strengthening of forces on the Alliance's eastern wing, including with new battle groups in central and eastern and south-eastern Europe, the secretary general said.
Ministers also adopted a joint statement today, expressing great concern at the very large-scale, unprovoked and unjustified accumulation of Russian forces in and around Ukraine and Belarus. Stoltenberg talks about well over 100,000 Russian soldiers along and in Ukraine. The statement said Russia's actions posed a serious threat to Euro-Atlantic security and had deployed additional ground forces in the eastern part of the alliance and additional naval and air forces to ensure the defense of all allies.
""We are also ready to further strengthen the defensive and deterrent stance in response to all possibilities,"" they said in a joint statement. At the same time, they pointed out that their measures are preventive, proportionate and do not contribute to aggravating the situation.
A final decision on where the new multinational battlegroups could be and how they would operate has not yet been decided. For now, in addition to strengthening its presence in the Baltic States and Poland, the deployment of forces in Romania, led by France, is planned. However, plans could also include Bulgaria, Slovakia and Hungary.
Stoltenberg described Russia's opposition to Europe's security order and the Alliance's core principles as a ""new reality"". ""We do not know what will happen in Ukraine. But we know what has already happened,"" he said. Russia is accumulating troops and equipment along and in Ukraine, so far there is no evidence of a withdrawal, which is being talked about in Moscow, he reiterated.
Regarding the recent cyber attacks in Ukraine and the possibility that they mark the beginning of a larger military operation, Stoltenberg said that the cyber attack is a measure that would be expected before a major military operation in Ukraine, so they are worried and therefore call on Russia to calm down. size.
Stoltenberg is persistently reiterating Russia's Allied invitation to a meeting as soon as possible within the framework of the NATO-Russia Council, a consultation and cooperation mechanism set up two decades ago. This one met on January 12 for the first time in two and a half years.
He also reiterates that NATO will uphold its core principles, such as the right of each country to decide on its own security arrangements, but that the Allies are ready to discuss strengthening existing communication channels, Russia's European security concerns and arms control .
The Secretary-General also emphasized the importance of further strengthening the Allied defense budgets. He is pleased that European Allied and Canadian spending is rising for the seventh year in a row, and that they have spent an additional $ 270 billion on defense since 2014.
According to new data, Stoltenberg did not provide information on how many allies already meet the target of two percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for defense. However, he welcomed the fact that the vast majority of Allies are already devoting at least a fifth of their defense budgets to investment.
The ""inevitable Russian invasion"" has been announced in the American and British media in recent days, which is expected to begin around 1 am this morning, citing intelligence sources from the USA and Great Britain. Representatives of both governments also spoke about the imminent attack. None of this has (for now) come true. On the contrary, Moscow is announcing that the military exercises announced and taking place along the eastern Ukrainian border, in Crimea and Belarus, are coming to an end, and the units are retreating to their starting positions in the interior of the country.

In addition, the Russian Ministry of Defense has released several videos showing the withdrawal of Russian troops.
Russia at the same time accuses Washington of trying to create hysteria in the United States, which would serve as an excuse for the additional deployment of American troops in Europe.
The websites of the Ukrainian government and its ministries, however, suffered a series of cyber attacks on Tuesday that kept them down for some time. Attempted attacks were also reported from two Ukrainian banks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has denied Russian involvement in cyber attacks, including recent events in Ukraine.
With growing fears of a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has declared today Unity Day. ""Great people of great Ukraine! This day is ours,"" he told fellow citizens. ""Those who live on the right and left banks of the Dnieper, in towns and villages near the Carpathians, on the shores of the Black and Azov Seas,"" he added on social media.
In a televised address, however, he later said that Ukrainians are united around a common desire to ""live in peace, happiness, in a family, children with parents."" ""No one can love our home like us. And only we, together, can protect our home,"" he added.
Russia's security council sees the United States as a threat
Russia's security council sees the United States, which has deployed tens of thousands of troops and weapons in Europe in recent years, as a threat. According to Deputy Security Council Secretary Mikhail Popov, Russia is forced to respond to these threats. Washington has also accused anti-Russian hysteria.
The U.S. has increased its ground forces in Europe by 30 percent in the past seven years, while the intensity of U.S. bomber flights near the Russian border has increased by 40 percent in the past year, Popov told Rosiska Gazeta. As he said, the main goal of the US in Europe is to ""create a constant threat"" against Russia. Thus, they have established a significant military force in the region, numbering more than 60,000 troops, 200 tanks and about 150 fighter jets.
The U.S. is also keeping its tactical nuclear weapons ""on standby,"" and ""the capabilities of the European segment of the U.S. Global Missile Shield"" are being strengthened, he added. Russia is forced to respond to these threats, which require financial and material resources. The presence of American forces and their aggressive policies are therefore causing financial and economic damage to Russia, he asserted.
Popov also accused Washington of inciting anti-Russian hysteria not only to deter Russia, but also to offer Europe its military technology and energy supply. Russia's Security Council is a body chaired by the country's president. It takes decisions related to national security and issues of strategic importance."

""Despite the current difficult situation, business is running smoothly and smoothly. However, we are well aware of all the risks that the worst-case scenario could bring. for Russia, ""said Iskratel CEO Robert Kuzmic. Iskmrate has no employees from Slovenia in Ukraine, as all work is done by the local team, including the director, Kuzmič added.
For Duol, the Ukrainian market represents only a few percent of sales. ""Currently, talks are underway on a major project, a football hall, which, if a contract is signed, will be realized next year,"" said Duola's first husband, Dušan Olaj.
The aggravation of the situation does not directly affect Duol's business in Ukraine. ""However, given that we do business with both the Russian Federation and Ukraine, there are a number of questions from our clients about who we support. We tell everyone very clearly - and this is our business policy everywhere - that political issues are nowhere and never we define and that these are exclusively matters of the parties involved, ""he stressed.
Duol is planning a trip to Ukraine next week, but it will be postponed as a precaution.
The consequences of a possible Russian attack on Ukraine are difficult for Olay to assess. ""We see the problem mainly in the possible demands of the parties involved that we should take a stand on the conflict. In any case, a possible war on both sides would interrupt investment flows for some time and result in a loss of orders and business,"" Olaj added.
Intereuropa has a subsidiary in Ukraine, TOV TEK ZTS Užgorod, which is one of the smaller companies in the group in terms of both revenue and number of employees. The revenues of this subsidiary represent a smaller share, less than 1.5 percent in the structure of all revenues of the group, they explained. The company does not employ Slovenian citizens, and the company is located in western Ukraine, near the border with Slovakia and Hungary.
""Trade flows between the EU and Russia have so far been largely disrupted; we estimate that this new tightening will not have a significant impact on TOV TEK ZTS Uzhgorod,"" they added. At the moment, it is also difficult to assess the impact of a possible Russian attack on Ukraine, as the operations of the subsidiary would be affected by disruptions in goods flows and supply chains.
Lek also operates in Ukraine, but explained that they do not comment on political events and related activities in accordance with Novartis rules."

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/slovenka-leta-2021-je-nika-kovac.html,Slovenian in 2021 is Nika Kovač,"Anthropologist and sociologist, founder and director of the March 8 Institute Nika Kovač was chosen as the Slovene woman in 2021. She is best known for her role in the campaign against the Water Act and the Only Yes Means Yes petition. She was also part of the Barack Obama Foundation's elite class of 40 future European leaders, where she learned from people in the US administration.","Every year, the Slovenian of the Year is chosen by the readers of the Jana magazine. This year, they chose from nine names, or 15, as six women were nominated together. In their opinion, the woman who marked the past year the most was Nika Kovač, who was awarded the title at a gala event in the Linhart Hall of Cankarjev dom. ""Candidates are vying for the title, who can boast of special positive qualities, striving for a better world, upright posture or success in their field,"" they explain in the magazine.
Who is Nika Kovač?
Almost everyone should hear about Kovač today. She is one of the most recognizable Slovenian activists, most recognizable for her role in the campaign against the water law, when she mobilized more than 600,000 citizens to vote free for the controversial water law. In addition, she was the face of the petition Only Yes Means Yes, which was finally enacted by politics after public pressure.
Anthropologist and sociologist, founder and director of the March 8 Institute is aware that “there is power in the community, and she is constantly proving it,” the journal writes.
Among other things, she was part of the Barack Obama Foundation’s elite class of 40 future European leaders, where she learned from people from the U.S. administration and connected with the most penetrating activists, including meeting with the former U.S. president. When Obama turned 60 last August, he ranked her among the world's 60 creators of social change.
According to the magazine, as an Obama scholarship holder and researcher at Columbia University in New York, she ""regularly looks to Slovenia and continues to awaken civil society.
Many are wondering when she will enter politics, but in August last year she answered these questions: ""No, absolutely not. Nika Kovač is going abroad, so I will not be on any list.""
In December, she met with LMŠ president Marjan Šarc, and many expected her to announce her candidacy on the list. ""A lot of people asked me if I would announce my candidacy with LMŠ today. I will not announce it. I was not even invited to do so,"" she said at the end of last year.
According to her, civil society can also cooperate with politics when fighting for the same goals. At the same time, they may be on opposite banks again on the next topic, she commented. In a conversation with Šarc, she emphasized that she would remain on the side of civil society. Although on some points they may also cooperate with the LMŠ and other opposition parties, they still intend to oppose government representatives when necessary.
Eight other candidates competed for the title
Retired specialist in neurology and psychiatry Vida Drama Orožim, sports climber Janja Garnbret, psychotherapist and biopsychologist, as well as the mother of two-year-old Urban Špela Miroševič, actress Zvezdana Mlakar, economist and executive director of the Slovenian Association leukemia Kristina Modic, biologist, environmentalist, activist and honorary president of the Society for the Study of Fish of Slovenia Andreja Slameršek and assistant professor, doctor, professor who supported students protesting against the closure of schools in front of the University of Maribor, Emilija Stojmenova Duh. Members of the Legal Network for the Protection of Democracy also competed for the title, they said."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/orban-ob-zacetku-volilne-kampanje-z-obljubami-drzavljanom-in-kritiko-opozicije.html,"Orban praised his government, sharply attacked the opposition and hinted at the possibility of leaving the EU","Speaking about the situation in the country, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban praised the achievements of his government and sharply attacked the opposition. He also spared no criticism of the EU, promising Hungarians to extend benefits due to rising energy prices and inflation. For the first time, Orban also hinted at the possibility of Hungary's exit from the EU.","In Hungary, the official election campaign began ahead of the April parliamentary elections. Orban, who is facing the strongest competition since forming an alliance of six opposition parties since taking office in 2010, also officially launched his Fidesz campaign with a speech.
Orban recalled the benefits for families and retirees, good economic indicators and a successful start to the pandemic. We are emerging stronger from the current crisis due to the pandemic than we entered it, said the Hungarian Prime Minister.
He accused the opposition of ""serious irresponsibility"" when he described the government as dictatorial, and said that if the opposition managed to come to power, it would run the country poorly. ""Not only the virus, but also the left has invaded Hungary,"" he said.
The importance of the parliamentary elections is huge, for Hungarians they are a question of existence, he stressed and urged citizens not to vote for the left, which has always been against the interests of the state.
In the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, he said, war should be avoided. He warned that if war broke out in Ukraine, ""hundreds of thousands or even millions"" of refugees would flee to Hungary.
Orban met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin in early February and promised co-operation with Moscow. The 58-year-old has friendly relations with Putin, while relations with Brussels are deteriorating.
According to Orban, Hungary is surrounded by an ""unstable region"". Hungary will not sit and watch as “the bad policies of the great powers cause devastation in our neighborhood”. ""We will not take any decisions from Brussels that are contrary to Hungarian interests,"" he stressed.
For the first time, Orban hinted at the possibility of Hungary's exit from the EU. As he said, the EU is waging a ""holy war, jihad"" under the guise of defending the rule of law. At the same time, the EU called for ""tolerance"" towards Hungary, as otherwise it will not be possible to continue on the common path."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/crncec-po-izgubljeni-tozbi-proti-toninu-napovedal-pritozbo.html,Črnčec announced the appeal after the lost lawsuit against Tonin,"The District Court in Kamnik rejected the claim of former State Secretary Damir Črnčec, who demanded compensation and cancellation of statements from the Minister of Defense and NSi President Matej Tonin due to public accusations of abuse of repressive devices. Črnčec's lawyer announced the appeal.","The court referred, among other things, to the right to freedom of expression, which is a fundamental condition for the development of a democratic society and for the development of every individual, according to the N1 portal. Criticism of the authorities enjoys the most freedom, and can be very harsh, but it can also contain exaggerations and expressions that are offensive to the words used. If the addressee was offended by the objectively insulting words, it does not mean that the limit of free expression has been crossed, the court summed up.
According to the court, in this particular case it was a politician's expression on a political issue of wider importance in the public interest, and Tonin's right to freedom of expression took precedence over Črnčeč's right to protection of honor and reputation. Namely, it ruled that Črnčec, despite not formally holding a political position since his resignation on 13 March 2020, is still an absolutely public figure as an advisor to the LMŠ party, the portal added.
Črnčec's lawyer Urška Kežmah said that the court's decision was quite interesting, as there was no extensive case law in this area. ""This is not about politics in the true sense of the word, so we insist that it is not about political personality,"" she explained, noting that this was the case when he was merely a party adviser. Tonin, however, did not comment on the court's decision, saying the verdict says it all.
Črnčec is suing Tonina for 7,000 euros because he was affected by words for one of the newspapers that he allegedly abused the state's repressive apparatus to fight the then opposition. The lawsuit dates back to the time when Tonin was the head of the parliamentary commission for the control of intelligence and security services, and Črnčec was the secretary in the cabinet of the then Prime Minister Marjan Šarc."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/oviranje-diskreditiranje-preiskovalna-komisija-z-ovadbami-nad-olaja-in-mahnica.html,"Commission of Inquiry with charges against Olaj and Mahnič, and both back against Medved","Former Director General of the Police Tatjana Bobnar pointed out to the Commission of Inquiry, which is investigating suspicions of political interference in the work of the Police, that she is under political pressure in her work. Rudi Medved, chairman of the parliamentary commission of inquiry, which is investigating suspicions of political interference in the work of the police at the request of the opposition, spoke about criminal charges against Anton Olaj and Žan Mahnič.","In today's continuation of the interrogation before the commission of inquiry, the former director general of the Police, Tatjana Bobnar, testified that she was harassed by the director general of the police, Anton Olaj, and at the same time a media pogrom.
Two days after she was first questioned before the commission on December 8 last year, she was at an annual interview with Olaj, which she said he questioned her about every statement she made before the commission. According to Bobnar, this part is not mentioned in the official record of the interview, so she did not sign the record herself.
Bobnar also said that it was said in the ""corridors of Litostrojska"" that she had ""special treatment"", as that ""someone was specifically in charge of looking for mistakes in all my past actions,"" when she was the director general of the Police. Such an attitude should also be shared by all those who have been appointed to the Working Group on Migration together with her. ""Because we expressed our opinion, because we dared to stand up for the lawful work of the Police,"" Bobnar said.
Regarding the working group for migration, she estimated that they were appointed to this group due to punishment, and that the public also perceived this in this way. She described the working group as ""a farce and an end in itself"", which was also confirmed by the head of the group, appointed by Interior Minister Aleš Hojs. “We are not offended,” she stressed, but no one has experience in the field of migration, nor are they involved in other processes within the Police that concern migration. Regarding the claims of Hojs and Secretary of State Franc Kangler that they would not have been nominated for the Performance Award if they had not done well, she said that this document never reached them.
Bobnar also said that the police should be a service to the people, not political interests, and that during the protests on October 5 last year, many police officers were ashamed of the actions of the police. But the cops “after the yellow jackets no longer know what’s right and what’s wrong,” she said.
The Ethics and Integrity Committee within the Police received a request from Olaj to review the writings of both police unions. She added that it was not the job of this committee to play the censor, which led to the dismissal of the director general from the committee. She also said it was worrying, however, that Olaj’s response was not in the minister’s tweets about “mews and sloths”.
On Thursday, she commented on the minister's statement at a hearing before the same commission of inquiry on ""appropriate and inappropriate"" prosecutors and NPU investigators, who were allegedly inappropriate because they were seen at anti-government protests: ""Do you intend to take away our right to vote? ? "" According to the minister, she described the ""second opinion"" in the security checks of police employees as a kind of manipulation.
According to her, political interference in the police is shown by the recently amended law, which was amended by the government coalition in such a way that the pre-trial procedure can now be directed to the prosecutor by the interior minister. ""This moves the prosecutor further than the proceedings,"" Bobnar said, adding that this blurred the line of inviolability of pre-trial proceedings before politics.
She added that she was not offended that she had been dismissed as director general of the police along with the appointment of a new government, and that given how she led the police, co-operation with the government would be ""short of breath"" if not dismissed. .
She reaffirmed that she was then in. d. Director General of the Police Anton Travner said at the handover that he ""got two conditions on Gregorčičeva that he must replace the director of the criminal police Boštjan Lindav and the director of the National Investigation Office (NPU) Darko Muženič"".
Bear on the pressure on those who dare to speak before the commission
According to Bobnar, Rudi Medved, chairman of the parliamentary commission of inquiry, spoke about the pressure on the commission: He is investigating suspicions of political influence on the work of the Slovenian police. She was questioned by the Director General of the Police, Dr. Olaj, who explained to her what she should and could not say before the commission of inquiry. This is, of course, inadmissible and also punishable under the Criminal Code. ""
But it all went even further, says Medved: ""Thus, David Antolovič, former assistant director of the National Investigation Office, underwent special treatment within the Police after being questioned by a commission of inquiry and received a warning before termination of employment. All this shows that the Director General of the Police, of course backed by the will of the ruling politics, does not choose the means to deal with people within the Police, and thus directly hinders the work of the commission of inquiry - and this is a crime , so the commission will send a report to the special state prosecutor's office on suspicion of a criminal offense for obstructing the work of a state body, in short, it will report the director general of the police, Dr. Olaj. ""
According to Medved, the ruling politicians are also involved in these attempts to influence: ""Yesterday, Interior Minister Aleš Hojs already made an attempt to defame one of the experts of the commission of inquiry. He did not go to the end because he knows the law well. However, Žan Mahnič, the State Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office, is obviously not so well acquainted with him. to take away credibility. Because of this, which is an insulting slander, the commission of inquiry will file a criminal complaint against Žan Mahnič. ""
He added that they intended to question Mahnič before the commission: ""We had quite a bit of information that during the protests, when he went to the operational headquarters, he was far from just watching the interpretation of the policy, but He was very loud there, he tried to influence those who led the police actions during the protests, but now we will not have to call him before the commission, as the Minister of the Interior Aleš Hojs himself confirmed this and said that Mahnič was at least to one staff so cheerful and loud that the Minister of the Interior himself had to calm him down. Then you can imagine what he was up to there, that it was too much even for the Minister of the Interior. ""
Asked whether Olaj would be called before the commission again, Medved said that this would not have added value, as he would only try to further discredit witnesses who confirmed the interference of politics in the work of the Police."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/vlada-in-fides-z-razlicnim-razumevanjem-zacasnosti-ukrepov.html,Government and Fidesz with different understandings of the ‘temporaryness’ of measures,"Although more than a week has passed since the government gave the green light to the signing of the agreement on raising doctors' salaries, they have not yet signed the agreement with the medical union. Why? According to our information, it has become difficult to understand what the temporary nature of the measures they have negotiated means - that is, whether all the provisions that bring higher salaries to doctors and dentists will be valid only this year or will be permanent.","The medical union FIDES and the Ministry of Health initialed the agreement, worth 113.5 million euros, on Monday last week, which was confirmed by the government last Thursday. This allowed a clear path for the signing of the agreement. The agreement was expected to be signed a week ago or at the beginning of this week at most. But that still hasn’t happened.
Fidesz and the ministry are still not commenting on the details of the deal. Unofficially, they agreed to raise the salaries of most doctors by six pay grades, and some specialist doctors by seven. One salary class means an increase of about 4% in salary, which means that the agreement would bring doctors 24 or. 28% increase in basic salary. As a result, allowances are also higher, which in real terms means a 30% increase in wages. They also agreed that the new maximum limit for doctors would be the 63rd pay grade, which was now reserved only for officials. So far, other civil servants have been able to reach a maximum of 57th salary grade.
Raising the salary ceiling for doctors and dentists is otherwise allowed by the Tenth Intervention Act. Article 48 stipulates that doctors may reach a maximum of 63 pay grades, which is envisaged for the period until the end of the year. The mentioned intervention law also stipulates that the state budget covers higher liabilities of the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia (ZZZS) due to the increase in salaries in health care, but only for this year. Meanwhile, there is no provision in this law that would limit the time increase in salaries for doctors in general.
If the increase in salaries were so permanent, it would be a permanent burden for the HIIS - salaries in health care are included in the prices of health services paid by the health insurance fund to health care providers. However, the ZZZS has been warning for some time that the policy only imposes new burdens on them, while it does not cover the additional costs of the health insurance fund. Insured persons do not pay as much as the policy wants to provide to various groups, the ZZZS reports. Thus, they propose that the amendment to the law should provide a permanent budgetary safeguard according to the principle that applies to the pension fund. This state budget covers the deficit for the current year.
Domino effect of demands for wage increases in the public sector
Otherwise, the agreement on raising the salaries of doctors has put other unions in the public sector on their feet. These now demand equal treatment, that is, to raise the salaries of all public sector employees by six grades. This request was also handed over to the Minister of Public Administration Boštjan Koritnik on Wednesday, who pointed out that such a salary increase for 188,000 employees in the public sector would mean 1.5 billion euros a year, which is not in line with the government's starting point. for the sustainability of public finances.
Public sector unions are also calling for automatic adjustment of the value of wage classes from this year onwards, at least through inflation. They also expect an increase in the value of salary grades by eliminating the equalization in the lower part of the salary scale - so that the value of the lowest salary grade rises to the level of the minimum wage and then appropriate ratios to higher salary grades are agreed."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/kaj-je-nastalo-na-pogoriscih-nekdaj-uspesnih-lesnih-podjetij-iz-casa-nekdanje-jugoslavije.html,The timber industry was the flagship of the former Yugoslavia,"In the time of Yugoslavia, wood was the 'flagship', and Slovenia is known for its successful companies in the field of wood processing. These companies have gone bankrupt due to market losses, poor adaptation to change and privatization. This was followed by more than a decade of decline in the wood processing industry in Slovenia. Companies from that time say that the state forgot about them. What is the situation today? Is the timber industry picking up?","Murales from Ljutomer boasts more than 30 years of tradition in the production of massive seating dining furniture, chairs, tables, corner benches and dining cabinets. It is one of the few companies in the wood industry that has not suffered the same fate as the rest - collapse. How did they manage to create a 30-year tradition? They have adapted to the end customer. ""This means that we make our products to the stage of a raw item, when we are waiting for an order from a customer who can decide on the surface treatment and upholstery materials, thus adapting the product to their needs."" This, they say, has helped them penetrate foreign markets. ""We make products under well-known brands for well-known customers."" Murales faced the challenges of technological advancement in the 1990s. ""Considerable investment in development was needed, and brand recognition was also a challenge.""
About 200 kilometers away, in Mirno pri Gorici, another company has been writing a success story since 1992. It is Smart Industries, owned by Bruno Bizjak. ""We are celebrating our 30th anniversary this year. We have spent this period, the company has been successful all these years. After independence, we were one of the leading Slovenian companies.""
Both companies have adapted to the conditions of the time. “We don’t think about quantity, but less is more,” says Bruno Bizjak. In Murales, some time ago, simpler products were made in large series, especially chairs and tables, which were constantly repeated. Later, they began to enrich the program, adapting it to the wishes of the clients. ""All the time, we have remained a largely export-oriented company, which is an advantage in its own right, as exports simply force you to change and progress."" Now, in addition to chairs, they produce many other solid wood products, especially for foreign companies, and are constantly developing new products. ""Above all, we are focused on making more demanding products from solid wood, as only in this class of products can we compete in the market.""
What they also have in common is that they have their own saw. More than 20,000 cubic meters of logs are cut in Smart Industries' own sawmill. Within the company, they combine the whole wood chain - from cutting logs to making the final product - furniture, kitchen boards, various wood semi-finished products, glued solid wood ... ""Together with our employees we create one such successful story,"" describes Bruno Bizjak. With their products, they are present on practically all European continents.
In Murales, they say that their own saw has helped them to be more flexible, as they prepare the material themselves - wood according to their own wishes and needs, regardless of whether it is available on the market. ""In addition, we also sell sawmill products (boards, elements, various leftovers ...), which sometimes represents eight to ten percent of sales. Of course, we try to sell what we have left over, but we also do various cooperation deals.""
Murales uses wood of Slovenian origin, except for American walnut, which is rarely used. ""Unfortunately, state forests restrict our supply with 'quotas' that they set, so we don't get enough of them and we also buy a lot from local private individuals."" Bruno Bizjak says that they used to make wooden elements themselves. ""Times are changing, labor costs are rising."" Semi-finished products are imported from nearby neighboring countries, while about 20 percent of the wood comes from state forests, and the remaining 80 percent has to be found on the open market. ""For now, we are succeeding, but how the supply route will go forward, there are many unknowns now."" Both companies are export-oriented.
Years ago, the state forgot about the wood processing industry
""We were excellent in Slovenia in terms of woodworking, we had wonderful companies and an interest in woodworking. Woodworking was our pride. Before the war, there were about 37,000 of us employed in woodworking, today there are about 11,000 of us,"" Bruno recalls. Bizjak. Later, the state no longer saw woodworking. ""The state forgot about us. We can't be like Asia that exports gasoline, we can't afford it. We have wood that needs to be processed, we need to bring the finished products to customers.""
The timber industry lost more than a third of its jobs in the first crisis, which began in 2008, and many factories closed. ""Our wood processing industry has been in a severe crisis since 2008, especially after 2011. It is slowly becoming stronger, its capacities are increasing, it is modernizing,"" says Nike Krajnc from the Forestry Institute of Slovenia. ""Looking back 20 years, we can really say that the wood industry was at a very high level. Especially in the market of the former Commonwealth was the flagship, we processed a lot of wood,"" said Danilo Anton Ranc, Director General of the Directorate of Wood at the Ministry for economic development and technology. As he says, after this period there was a decline in production, a reduction in staff. “It may have been the wrong economic orientation of the country to support energy-intensive industries that consume a lot of energy and are not based on domestic resources,” Ranc adds.
He believes that there was no interlocutor for this industry at the state level and elsewhere. ""Wood was considered an energy source, which caused a lot of damage to the industry because the raw material became more expensive. Subsidies went to burning wood, which is not added value. Let's look at auctions where logs reach a value of 10 thousand euros, sometimes logs ended up in kilns. These logs must be directed to production lines, to value-added products and not exported abroad. ""
According to Bizjak, woodworkers reached their peak in the 1980s and persisted until independence. ""Then there was the wild privatization of timber plants, the closure of big giants. We started picking up later, and from 2013 onwards I can say that timber is in a kind of boom, in quotes.""
They used to have large woodworking plants - Lipa, Meblo, Javor, Stol, Liko Vrhnika, Brest - which had everything from a sawmill to the furniture industry, they produced chipboard themselves. They were important players in the Yugoslav market and one of the largest exporters of chairs to America. ""With the restructuring and privatization, these companies fell apart, did not adapt to the new situation, especially in the furniture industry. So we had about five chipboard manufacturers, now we have none. At that time we did not know how to set up new wood processing industries."" which would be more in step with the times, ""estimates Nike Kranjc.
Why did companies fail? According to Miha Humar from the Biotechnical Faculty, there are several reasons - markets collapsed, Eastern Europe suddenly no longer needed mass products from Yugoslavia - in Yugoslavia, in any children's room you came, there were two versions of rooms, two versions of kitchens. .. ""People opted for diversity, and the industry simply did not follow suit. The second part is certainly related to the abolition of development departments, the industry was labor-intensive, which suddenly no longer followed the trends of the time."" He says that in the second wave it was mostly export companies, exporters were somewhat squeezed by the underestimation of the tolar in some respects. The third wave was privatization, the locations of factories stood on interesting lands, which were used for shopping centers, for housing estates ...
'We are looking for the slowest ship to fix it so that the whole industry can move forward faster'
An important question when we talk about the timber industry is what is the weakest link. ""If we could identify only one article, it would be relatively easy, because then we would work on only one article and solve it. It should be emphasized that the industry is still growing and we are looking for the weakest links or the slowest ship to fix it. that the whole industry will move forward faster, ”says Humar. He sees the opportunity for progress in the companies themselves, which should strengthen the development departments in order to develop more innovative, better products, if everyone worked in this field, the whole industry would move faster. ""We want more collaboration between the primary sector and the furniture industry to make companies more ownership-oriented and seek optimal benefits, not for each individual link, but within the entire value chain. As a whole, the whole chain would work better, more successfully."" He highlights an example of positive cooperation between Ekoart and Lumar, which have set up a joint venture to market an innovative product.
Is the timber industry booming again today after a long period?
Danilo Anton Ranc assures that we have now recognized that wood is our strategic direction. ""We have placed it among the strategic industries in industrial strategy. We can talk about an important, pivotal period.""
Humar also estimates that the Slovenian wood industry has been advancing in recent times - both in terms of quality and quantity. ""All indices for 2021 point in a positive direction, sales of furniture and building elements such as houses are growing."" When we compare the state of the wood industry today, compared to the time of the disintegration of Yugoslavia, we cannot put all things on the same denominator, because it is a different industry, adds Humar. The wood industry has completely changed, in the time of Yugoslavia it was a large series, labor industry, where few products were produced in large numbers. Today, it is a robotic, automated industry that produces products with high added value. it has never been realistic to employ 40,000 people, because automation is growing, so fewer people are producing more and more, which also makes sense in terms of industry trends. ""
""There are many opportunities in any product that is built-in wood or a product made of wood, especially if the 'back to nature' guideline continues to apply,"" Murales said. ""This means more and more use of natural materials (including wood), in almost all areas (from construction to furniture and small items for everyday use). "" In their opinion, the problem is still in allowing the import of competitive low-cost products from eastern countries, which are very difficult for producers in Slovenia to compete with.
In Murales, they partly agree that the timber industry is booming, but believe that this is more the case with the primary wood processing industry. ""We furniture makers are still a little neglected, though.""
""There is definitely a lot to do, we entrepreneurs face many problems every day, but we are happy to overcome them because we believe that our woodworking also has a future,"" adds Bizjak. According to him, woodworking has a future in Slovenia, but we must approach it correctly. ""We've kind of forgotten about him over the last 20 years, but I think now is the right time to fix what we missed and start playing a new lead.""
And what do the numbers show, in what condition is the wood processing industry? The Directorate of Wood Science monitors data on the operations of wood processing and furniture companies, noting that in the last decade the wood industry has recorded positive trends - the number of companies increased by 15 percent (from 875 to 1,008), sales revenue by 31 percent (from 990 million euros to 1.3 billion euros), value added by 82 percent (from 21 thousand euros to 38 thousand euros) in this period.
According to the Statistical Office, in the wood industry from the summer of 2020 to the autumn of 2021, there is a trend of production growth in the range of 20 to 25 percent. The Forestry Cluster at the Forestry Chamber of Slovenia estimates that the wood industry is experiencing a marked positive growth trend after the initial decline due to the covida-19 pandemic. ""Thus, in 2021 and 2022 we also expect a positive business result and an increase in the number of employees.""
Nike Kranjc says that now the successes of the policy are being reaped, which was more focused on looking for domestic raw materials, domestic resources, to equip ourselves somewhere for what we have in Slovenia and we have a lot of wood in Slovenia. ""If 60 percent of Slovenia is covered by forests, we must know how to use this wealth.""
""In recent years, there has been a lack of accumulation, investment in equipment has been insufficient because there were not enough sources of funding, and the problem is also human resources. We also face problems with the supply of basic raw materials, you are developing your business. However, if you do not have a guaranteed raw material, your further development will somehow stop here. "" Bizjak adds that the state or diplomacy should act here to promote connections with world actors.
We are lagging behind competing countries
""We are about 20 percent behind our competing countries. Slovenian politics must see the development of woodworking as one of the potential opportunities for breakthrough into the international economy. It must be an opportunity for the development of woodworking, as neighboring countries have seen. we must no longer allow it, ""said Bruno Bizjak.
Austria is also overtaking us. According to Nika Kranjc, the Austrians invested a lot in the wood processing industry in the 1990s. ""They quickly realized that this is one industry that will bring a lot into their GDP."" Humar says the furniture industry across Europe has been in a relative crisis. ""In Italy, 18 million chairs were made a year, after the relocation of production to China, production fell to one million. This part of the low-cost furniture industry has been affected across Europe."" During the collapse of Yugoslavia, a lot was done in Austria in the field of primary wood processing, sawmills were modernized and today the forest wood processing industry in Austria is in second place after tourism in terms of income and employment. ""In this way, they also promote it appropriately. Forest owners and loggers are closely linked, they invest in promotion together, they take a certain percentage of the promotion funds from each cubic meter sold, research conducted by Proholz in Austria, where they promote wood at all levels and the result of 15, 20 years of hard work is where they are present today. ""
Key investments of foreigners in the Slovenian wood processing industry
According to the Wood Cluster, the largest foreign investments in Slovenia are in Novi Car Interior Design, which produces components for the automotive industry, the company comes from Germany. It is followed by Lesonit Ilirska Bistrica, owned by the Italian Fantoni, LIP Bohinj - the company is owned by the Hasslacher Norica Timber Group from Austria and MBS LIST owned by the Austrian MBS Handels, which took over the stopped sawmill of Postojna Forestry in Stari trg near Lož and restarted , and a year later it also took over the production of formwork panels.
Lesonit also employed more than 1,000 people in the 1980s, and was among the first in Europe to start producing fiberboard. In addition to the fiberboard factory, Lesonit had a furniture factory, a sawmill, a veneer factory, a sawmill, a paint shop and a hardboard factory. The fall in the sale of Lesonit coincided with the collapse of Yugoslavia, which ended in a forced settlement, then was bought by the Italian Fantoni. Today, it is one of the largest manufacturers in Slovenia in terms of the amount of veneer and fiberboard. Lesonit sells most of its products on foreign markets. ""In the long history of Lesonit, we have adapted to market requirements, as well as administrative requirements. Only timely adjustment is possible for the long-term existence of the company. Therefore, in the past there were more products that we had to abandon,"" they say today in Lesonit. Today, the company employs more than 100 people and ended the year with a profit of 3.7 million euros.
According to the leaders in Lesonit, the basis for accelerating the development of the wood processing industry largely depends on the speed of both state and municipal institutions, which issue various permits for the expansion or modernization of wood processing plants. ""It is even more dependent on legislation that allows various NGOs to hold these proceedings indefinitely.""
Will Otiški Vrh come to life?
In the past we had several manufacturers of chipboard in Slovenia, today there are none. A few years ago, Turkish investors bought the Otiški Vrh Particleboard Factory from bankruptcy through Yildiz Entegre Adria, part of the Turkish international concern Yildizlar Yatirim Holding, but today this investment stands. Danilo Anton Ranc, former director of Otiški Vrh, says that wood composites, such as chipboard, are in great demand, so he thinks it makes sense to revive this production. As Ranc explains, the strategic buyer froze the matter. ""Talks are underway because the state supports this investment, to revive production, to direct part of the poor raw material to such locations. We expect that it will be realized.""

Brussels warned that voting in parliament was an unacceptable violation of BiH's constitutional and legal order.","Despite a boycott of opposition parties, the Parliament of Republika Srpska passed a law establishing the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council (HJPC) of Republika Srpska today, despite a boycott of opposition parties by Milorad Dodik. The purpose of this is to separate the judicial authorities of the Republika Srpska from the relevant institutions of BiH. The draft law on the HJPC envisages the assumption of powers that the HJPC BiH has had since 2004 as the only body authorized to appoint judges and prosecutors throughout the country.
Today, the National Assembly adopted a bill on the property of the Republic of Srpska. In doing so, it effectively annulled the 2005 decision of former High Representative for BiH Paddy Ashdown to ban the disposal of state property until a law is passed in the BiH parliament to regulate the issue. Ashdown's decision was based on the fact that BiH, as the legal successor of the former Socialist Republic of BiH, was at the same time the successor of all social property at the time.
According to the Croatian news agency Hina, the adoption of both laws threatens the constitutional order of BiH and directly undermines the authority of the office of the High Representative of the International Community in BiH, led by German Christian Schmidt. A few days ago, the Republika Srpska authorities warned that the establishment of a high judicial and prosecutorial council at the entity level would clearly violate the 2004 law on the establishment of such a body at the state level on the basis of an agreement between the entities.
Today's decision is part of the policy of Bosnian Serb leader Dodik, which aims to separate the Serb part from BiH. Dodik also seeks to separate the army, police, secret service and tax administration from state institutions. Such a policy is contrary to the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the war in Bosnia.
The moves of the parliament in Banja Luka were also responded to in Brussels. Today's vote in the Republika Srpska parliament in connection with the establishment of a separate HJPC constitutes an ""unacceptable violation of BiH's constitutional and legal order"", said Peter Stano, a spokesman for the EU's foreign policy chief.
If adopted, the law will seriously affect the rights of the citizens of Republika Srpska, deepen legal uncertainty and instability in the country's judicial system, and seriously undermine BiH's European perspective, he added."

Slovenian Istria 'won',"Is the real name Obala with a capital letter, Koper coast, Istria? Discussions about this have been dragging on for decades. The Gordian knot has now been decided to be cut by politicians who have instructed the profession to standardize the name. The end result: Slovenian Istria. However, the name, which many people already use, will obviously not be liked by everyone.","In the last 20 years, the term Obala has been adopted among young people, but older people oppose it. They say the coast is merely the contact of the sea with the land. Besides: what are we then? Obalcani? Coastal? Not at all.
Politics decided to end the controversy by handing over the matter to experts led by linguist Vesna Mikolič. ""When it already seemed that the Coast or the Littoral might be established in central Slovenia, Istria, including Slovenian Istria, appeared more and more often in the last 10 or even 20 years,"" Mikolič said.
And this will also be decided by politics. Koper and Ankara municipal councilors have already confirmed the matter, Izola and Piran have not yet. As it turns out, it’s not going to be completely easy. Some are mainly bothered by the word Slovenian. ""Why Slovenian? This is Istria. I am an Istrian, or an Istrian, I am not a Slovenian Istrian,"" one of the participants in the session was clear.
""Istria is one and this can be a problem, because the first association with Istria is always the Istrian peninsula as a whole,"" says Mikolič.
I am no longer so convinced of such confusion. And if I have always claimed to be a coastal correspondent, this is clearly not the case. ""So, you are an Istrian correspondent,"" the linguist clarified.
It will, it seems, be a standardized name that we will use at least in official communication, and time will tell whether we will accept this in everyday life as well.

Although he was even closer to that a few months ago, when he had almost announced his candidacy for governor of Texas, he changed his mind at the last minute and decided that his career in politics would have to wait some time. Nevertheless, the actor follows politics closely and often talks about his beliefs in the media, and in an interview with Fox News Digital recently said that American politics is too focused on partisanship and not the well-being of the country as a whole.","Matthew McConaughey recently said he is very disturbed by the political divisions in the United States, which are further tearing apart the already conflicting Democratic and Republican parties. A few months ago, the American media reported that the actor, after many years of predictions, is finally entering political waters, but the Texan-born eventually changed his mind again and did not run for governor of Texas. The bookmakers predicted a convincing victory for the star against other serious rivals.
In an interview with Fox News Digital, the star pointed out that America has forgotten common values, and its politicians are focusing too much on the ‘blue’ and ‘red’ sides, by which he meant the colors of the Democratic and Republican parties. “Sometimes it seems to me that their identity is based entirely on the annulment of another, rather than trying to realize their own visions,” the 52-year-old actor said. ""I think we are all aware that this is not a way to bring something good in the long run,"" he added.
The Oscar-winning actor made a statement in November stating that he did not intend to run for governor of Texas in the upcoming election, but did not rule out this possibility for the future: ""As a simple child born in the small Texas town of Uvalde, we it never occurred to me that he would ever be considered a potential political leader of the country. This is a path I can follow with humility and inspiration. This is also a path I have not yet decided to take. "" He added that he will continue to support artisans, businesses and foundations in which he believes and works for the benefit of the whole community as they work with a mission, build on people’s trust and at the same time create prosperity. ""It's the American dream,"" he added at the time. The Americans will elect new state governors on November 8, 2022."

The first said that the party was established with the desire to enter the National Assembly, where they could demand the implementation of the program in the field of environment, economy, agriculture, the situation of young people and democracy. After the founding congress, it was announced that Vesna is entering the political space with ""people of action"" and a well-finished program.","After the congress, they pointed out that the party ""in the flood of green parties has already shown its difference by choosing the place where it begins its political path"". ""Zagorje ob Savi is of great importance due to sustainable efforts and is a symbol of the achievements of individuals and informed local authorities involved in caring for the environment and a better future of society. with their past actions already demonstrated, ”they pointed out.
Co-president Uroš Macerl called for joining the party, as ""time is running out when we could only helplessly watch the situation worsen"". According to him, it is also time to ""show the door to complete disunity between people, environmental crime, social injustice and the poor situation of young people"".

As Macerl said in a statement to the media after the congress, the party was formed from people who have proven in numerous campaigns that they are ready to work for the good of society and that together they can. They want to take the country on the right track, he said. Because they can do it together, Macerl estimates that it is time to break with the division of society and to put integration and joint projects at the forefront. We need to take care of young people and provide them with jobs and housing, and we need to end economic and environmental crime, says Macerl.
“This is a commitment that we will not fulfill only in words, but in actions, because we are people of action,” he asserted. If they come to parliament, which is their intention, they aim to enter the government, as the opposition can only criticize, Macerl announced, adding that they are not ready to cooperate with the SDS due to the conditions in which this party operates. does not fall within the context of their ethical standard and commitments.
Zgojznikova said that with the founding of the Vesna party, they had laid a solid foundation for real green politics and democratic decision-making within the party. He also believes that the Vesna party is a party of people and content.
""We will strive to make our policy honest, transparent and democratic. We will not make false promises that we will not be able to fulfill. Our work is the proof that gives strength to everything and we want to bring this enthusiasm into politics,"" he said. Zgojznikova also pointed out.

Jasmina Jerant and Klemen Belhar became the party's vice-presidents, and other party bodies, the party's statute and program were also approved at the congress.
Among the party's most important topics will be investments in the green economy, sustainable farming models and organic food production, improving mobility, obtaining energy from truly renewable sources, solving housing problems and ensuring democracy, transparency and inclusiveness. ""All these areas are written in the party's program with tangible proposals for solutions,"" Vesna emphasized.
The establishment of the party was welcomed and ensured by many representatives of the European Green Party, including Co-President of the European Green Party Thomas Waitz, Co-Chair of the Greens in the European Parliament Bas Eickhout and Ska Keller, Secretary General of the Greens in the European Parliament Vula Tsetsi and others.

Although still without political content and personnel, the political newcomer thus overtook the hitherto leading Janša SDS. The Prime Minister responded to this pick on Twitter, but what about the remaining political competition?","Who would you vote for if there were an election on Sunday? Robert Golob's Svoboda Movement convinced as many as one-fifth of the electorate, although for now its only trump card is only the name of the main protagonist, thus overtaking all the currently strongest political players.
Slovenes like new faces. They like unlisted lists that are still politically untainted or that have not yet stated themselves clearly enough about program principles. And that is why they can project their political ideals into them. But this is the beginning of a journey for him. The campaign will be long ""The path will be steep and I wish him all the best,"" comments the coordinator of the Left, Luka Mesec.
""Slovenia and Slovenians have already had some experience with these new faces.

Voters ranked the Christian Democrats sixth in a survey conducted for national television at the Mediana Institute ahead of another newcomer, Aleksandra Pivec.

Of course, this is not yet a concrete election announcement, but the starting party starting points are in the super-election year.
""I am very confident, because the mileage, the tradition of the SD party is that new faces have always come - gone, but the party with tradition, with people on the ground remains. The only real opinion polls will be on April 24. And then it matters if we want changes to get people to come and take part in these elections, ""said SD President Tanja Fajon.
""Parrots,"" Prime Minister Janez Jansa responded briefly to the results and, in parallel with the previous elections, when Marjan Sarec had the most public support a few months before the vote, while the SDS won, questioned the results.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/fajonova-sd-se-je-pripravljena-umakniti-iz-javnega-servisa.html,Fajonova: SD is ready to withdraw from the public service,"At the expert conference of the Social Democrats, experts in the fields of media and culture highlighted the interventions of the current government in the independence of these two areas as well as in civil society as extremely problematic. According to them, politics must commit itself to such a break-up in these segments of society that will never happen again. When asked whether SD as a party is ready to withdraw from the public service, Tanja Fajon assured that they did. Former journalist Boris Bergant called for this to be included in the coalition agreement.","Invited experts in the field of media and culture at the conference entitled Why Did You Raise Your Voice - Fear of Culture and the Power of Argument, organized by the SD, highlighted the government's crackdown on NGOs, media and culture. financial resources, which has led to self-censorship in these segments. Lawyer Nataša Pirc Musar said that putting on muzzles within the government and political parties is worrying.
Even more worrying, she said, is that the current government is trying to intimidate people who dare to speak out with unreasonable and legally unfounded fines.
The director of the Mini Theater, Robert Waltl, pointed out that in the case of the Slovenian Press Agency (STA) it was clear that none of the non-governmental and cultural organizations were on the safe side. The government also reduced the amount of funding for non-governmental and cultural organizations during the epidemic, when they did not have the opportunity to make money, he said. Historian Kaja Širok pointed out that we should also publicly recognize that culture is a public good.
Former journalist Boris Bergant pointed out that it is problematic for a government body to evaluate the content of a public service and publish it every week. “If that’s not pressure on editorial policy, let the devil take me,” he concluded. According to him, the only solution in the renovation of RTV is to realize that public service is a good for everyone, not just for the ruling party.
Pirc Musar challenged SD with the question of whether, as a party, they are ready to withdraw from the public service. Both Tanja Fajon and former Minister of Culture Dejan Prešiček assured her that they were ready to do so. ""The public service must be politically inviolable. I am the first to give my word for it,"" Fajon said. Bergant called for this to be included in the coalition agreement.
Media expert and activist Sandra Bašič Hrvatin pointed out that our rights have never been given to us and that we must insist on them. ""If I don't persevere, I won't be human anymore,"" she said, adding that this is exactly what the current government wants. She directly asked Fajonova whether the SD was distancing itself from the actions of President Borut Pahor, who did not publicly oppose the current government. Fajon replied that history cannot be erased. “But a new generation is coming that is trying to work differently,” she added.
Columnist Miha Mazzini, meanwhile, highlighted the fierce battle for privileges as the biggest problem. He cited the beginning of the epidemic as an example, when the rules of the game were set, and the next day photos were released showing how the rulers are violating them. He also said that in a country of privileges, where the only criterion is who is ours or. yours, ours all allowed.
All participants in the consultation also pointed out that the opposition should make ten commitments, which it will implement when and if it comes to power, so that citizens can transparently monitor and evaluate their work. Therefore, according to experts, politics must give people a clear message that such a crackdown on the media, culture and NGOs will never be tolerated again, noting that all further procedures must be carried out legally, otherwise they are no different from the current government."
https://www.24ur.com/magazin/dzevad-karahasan.html,"'Fear does not allow for the complexity of emotions, so people start lying to themselves'","An epidemic of fear has gripped the world. But scared people don't build society - scared people are crowds, says Bosnian writer Dzevad Karahasan. We talked to Karahasan about the 'smell' of fear, as well as about what can save a world that is increasingly drowning in fear at the recent publication of the Slovenian translation of the novel Smell of Fear, which is the last part of his historical trilogy. .","Bosnian novelist, playwright, essayist and literary and theater theorist and critic Dževad Karahasan is the author of numerous novels: The Eastern Divan, The Shahriyar's Ring, Sara and Serafina, The Night Rally, and the trilogy What the Ashes Tell. He also writes plays, short prose, essays, and literary theoretical and critical texts. He has received numerous literary awards, including the Herder Prize (1999), the Elf (2010), the Goethe Prize (2012) and the Heinrich Heine Prize (2012).
This year, The Smell of Fear was published in Slovene, the last part of his historical trilogy about the famous medieval Persian mathematician, astronomer, philosopher and poet Omar Khayyam entitled What the Ashes Tell. The end of the trilogy connects historical time with the present, when a Bosnian refugee in Norway tries to write down Hajam's biography from memory, which burned down when the Sarajevo library was set on fire.
Karahasan is also a great thinker who penetrates the darkest corners of the individual and society with his mind and reveals them with words and metaphors. These days he was a guest of the pre-festival event Fabula before Fabula. That’s when we caught him and continued the conversation with him that started three years ago.
How have you spent the last three years after we last saw you in Ljubljana and the world has changed drastically?
To tell the truth, I spent these few years quite difficult, mainly because I was diagnosed with an illness. If I were prone to mystification, I would say that my experience of the last two years is proof that man is a microcosm in which the macrocosm is reflected. Because I was attacked by some diseases that didn’t let me get too upset about what was going on in the big world. In the big world, however, as you have seen, what we have been anticipating for a long time is happening or is becoming too obvious. First, the production of fears - fear of terrorism, fear of economic crisis, fear of climate change, fear of epidemics, disease… But in a world ruled by fear, there is not much room for freedom, for independence, especially for independent thinking, independent feeling … Frightened people do not build society. Frightened people are the crowd. A frightened man runs away into the crowd, and that’s not good. I am even grateful for my illness, although it sounds paradoxical, because it spared me these artificially produced fears and forced me to deal with myself.
And what did you learn about yourself during that time?
I learned nothing new. For example, I was convinced that I was right when I believed that I had come to terms with death at an early age. When I was diagnosed with cancer, I was neither scared nor upset and that made me very happy. I have always argued that the belief that people are afraid of death, that our fundamental fear is the fear of death, is a stupid Darwinist lie. How could she not be? When I came into this world, my death came with me. As I grew, so did she. Then at some point I stopped growing and she kept growing. So do you understand? How could I be afraid of something that has been in me since I was in this world? If I’m not afraid of my kidney, how could I be afraid of a death as close to me as my kidney? I’ve always said that, but I’ve never really checked to see if that’s how I feel. When I made sure I really felt that way, I was very happy, relieved.
In the second part of the trilogy, The Consolation of the Night Sky, we were able to hear Sabah’s spider web theory about sowing fear as a way to achieve political goals. In the last part, The Smell of Fear, we can also feel this theory - as the title suggests - in practice. This, of course, somehow resonates in today’s world, where we are somehow trapped in a web of pandemics and political crises. So what's the smell of fear?
It is the smell of the crowd, the smell of sweat, but not that healthy, beautiful sweat that a healthy body releases when doing hard work, running or giving birth to new life, but the sweat that is released right in fear, in the crowd. It’s the smell of addiction. Where there is fear, there is no room for independent thinking, no ability to feel independent. People are starting to try to simplify their emotions, reduce them to one dimension. People start lying to themselves.
A frightened man will never admit that the person he loves is the most annoying thing in the world. Who could get on my nerves as much as the wife I love? Because I spend the most time with her, she means the most to me - it is clear that she gets on my nerves the most. However, fear does not allow this complexity of human emotions. And then people start lying to each other. If someone loves someone, God forbid that in a dream he says that this person is bothering him, that something is getting on his nerves, that he has problems with her. And yet he must have them. There are no simple emotions.
Remember Goethe’s novel The Learning Years by Wilhelm Meister, in which the Grand Master writes about how important a part of growing up is that magical combination of fear and pleasure when a child steals jam from a home pantry. This joy is closely linked to the fear of being caught up in it. Where there is fear, people are not ready or able to endure these beautiful complexities of the contradiction of their own emotions. Not to mention the ability to think in complex structures and take into account the complexity of the phenomenon. Nothing is as easy as we would like when we are scared.
And we can see this even now, in the current situation, when it often happens that friends or family members quarrel or are on different shores because of the whole happening around the pandemic. We don't seem to be able to find common ground - either with me or against me.
That's right. Arithmetic principle ""but - but"". This principle works well in arithmetic, in the world of arithmetic. There are no forms, no body, no emotions and no life. In the world of life, however, the principle of ""in - and"" applies. And here we are again with this damn fear of ""either - or"". If you are my friend and you love me, you do not see any flaws in me and you praise me. Or you see that some things don't ""fit"" in me and you're my enemy. No, the ""either-or"" principle can't work well in the world of life.
I remembered an anecdote when we presented my book Reports from the Dark Province in Zurich. In the conversation, I allowed myself a joke at the expense of the exact sciences, which strive for absolute, undoubted truth. A colleague was upset by this and said, ""Mr. Karahasan, you too will admit that two plus two is always undoubtedly four."" I told him he was right. But why? Because there is nothing in the world of arithmetic except one-dimensional and one-dimensional relations. Let a little life, emotions, physicality come into the world of arithmetic, and you will see that two plus two is sometimes four, rarely five, often three to three and a half… Because life works on the principle of inclusion, not exclusion.
Let's go back to the metaphor of a spider's web and a fly caught in it, that is, to someone caught in this ""machine of fear"". How can a fly be rescued from a spider web?
This is a difficult question. I don't know, but I tend to believe or want to believe that we can avoid falling into a spider's web by being aware of ourselves. So that we resist fear. By building a little self-confidence to allow ourselves the right to decide for ourselves. Because fear does not allow us to look at it from a distance. Fear does not allow us to think clearly. You’ve noticed that fear also kills humor. A fly that thinks with its head and with a little humor understands its own limitations, its imperfections, looks where it goes and decides for itself, has a much better chance of not getting caught in a spider's web than any other fly .
I don’t know how to get out of these problems, but I know we can avoid them as long as we think with our head, feel with our heart, observe from a distance, and with a little laugh remind ourselves how imperfect we are.
Some like to say that sometimes it is necessary to let things fall to the ground so that we can rebuild better, stronger. But if we look at our planet - you yourself mentioned the fear of climate change - we have almost exhausted it, ""destroyed"" it. What or from what will future generations be able to build if we demolish everything?
The first, of course, is the question of what they will build at all where there is nothing left. And second, who will build at all? Because of our technological advances, for the first time in history, we have questioned the survival of humanity. So it’s no longer about what we’re going to build, it’s about who’s going to build. We are now in an absurd situation where we have to persistently repeat the mantra that science can save us, even though we are fully aware of the fact that science and technology have brought us into a situation where the survival of life and the planet we live on is highly questionable.
The only religions still alive in the world are ""scientism"" and finance. I don't know if you've noticed - in all the media at all ends and places they are constantly suing for the endangered climate. We hear demands for a ban on air transport, for a ban on burning coal, wood and heating oil. It does not occur to anyone, however, to ban tourist flights into space; the media almost aggressively demands that we are excited to admire, to feel how historic this day is… Why? Because some billionaire spent ten minutes in space. I remember the first time I heard this on reports. To a friend I was visiting, I said: Yuri Gagarin did it in 1961, but he was not a billionaire and did not fly as a tourist. This is a really paradoxical, absurd situation. Rene Descartes said “I think so I am”. He proved himself by the act of his thinking. This is complete solipsism. But we now have a similarly absurd situation where we have to expect science to save us from the mess in which they brought us.
What role can politics play in such a society? In one of the interviews, you said that politics does not have the tools to stop or reduce the role of ownership, capital.
In today's world of fear, politics itself demonstrates panic fear. Laws are being passed that make it very questionable whether they can work at all. Politics is left to some insane actionism that does not allow it to seriously consider, verify, comment on, and discuss its own ideas. I myself know nothing about electric cars, so I asked two engineers involved in the development of electric motors if there was a possibility of recycling or disposing of electric car batteries without danger. They said they had not yet developed such methods. However, the policy supports the development of electric cars, seeks to make it more difficult or even completely ban classic cars. Why? Because politics is also mired in fear.
What does this moment in history remind you of?
I think I’ve already described it in the trilogy What the Ashes Tell. In it, I described an era in which people were trying to save some sick society. As in a sick organism, any action we take to try to correct the condition can harm the patient. Maybe it helps the kidneys but destroys the liver, or it saves the liver and destroys the kidneys. As I say, the world can be saved by a little better literature, in other words, human creativity. People need to remember that they are creative beings. They just have to stop functioning and start living.
With this latest translation, the Slovenian market received the entire trilogy, which was originally published ten years ago. What are you currently creating? When can we expect a new novel from you?
I don't create anything - I write. We usually create from scratch, and I have a lot of material. Just a few days ago, I sent a new novel to publishers and translators, most likely to be called Introduction to Hovering. This, too, is one of the books I have written for an infinitely long time. I wrote the first parts in October 1998. I started a hundred times, but I gave up, corrected, then stopped writing for a long time… And now I finally managed to finish it. Interestingly, while writing this novel, I was interrupted halfway by illness. I remember lying in the hospital after the surgery, panicking wondering if I would ever finish this book at all.
Were you afraid you would fail?
No, but in short it's a little hard when something interrupts you… But when I sat down at the table again and continued writing, I knew or felt that I was healthy again."

Vice President Predrag Baković explained in several cases how political staffing takes place. He cited former Police Director Anton Travner as one of the first victims, who resigned in the middle of sailing. According to Baković, the current government does not tolerate criticism and tries to deal with anyone who is critical. ""This is also shown by the dismissal of a longtime police officer from the reserve auxiliary police, whom I personally know and know to be top notch. What they did to Mr Gantar when he spoke on Twitter ... They are doing all this in order to silence this cadre and to influence others so as not to raise their heads and say anything else! "" The National Assembly rejected the report by 44 votes to 42.","""As the chairman of the commission, I expect the National Assembly to adopt the essential findings of the interim report and to adopt a proposal for a resolution in which the National Assembly calls on the Minister of the Interior to resign,"" said Rudi Medved. He also called on the Prime Minister Janez Janša to inform the National Assembly of his resignation, ""because we know that the Minister has already resigned, but this announcement has never been made in the National Assembly"".
He said that the commission of inquiry had proved that staffing in the police was beyond professional competencies and on the principle of loyalty. Personnel who are not liked by the ruling politicians are being transferred to specially established working groups, which have neither assignments nor evaluations, Medved pointed out, adding that politics exercises its influence through the director general of the police.
According to him, the ruling policy through the National Investigation Office (NPU), which is completely politically reorganized, even affects the course or. the outcome of individual investigations. ""Investigators such as Zdravko Počivalšek and Rok Snežič are informed about house searches in advance, but they do not move from the deadlock,"" said Medved. He also assessed that Minister Aleš Hojs and state secretaries at his ministry were promoting controversial practices with their public appearances and posts on the social network, and therefore repeated several times that he was proposing the dismissal of the minister.
Predrag Baković said in a press release that the interim report of the commission of inquiry shows things about interference in institutions such as the police. First of all, of course, by setting up such staff. Politics can completely legally replace the Director General of the Police, and here staffing should stop. Especially political. But it didn't. People took key positions, which then enabled open the door wide for politicians to start their actions, by recruiting and interfering in specific matters, if you remove key people from important investigations and put them in some working groups, it is certainly interference in individual cases. , who was the head of the investigation into the purchase of protective equipment, who suddenly found himself in this working group. This was made possible by key people in positions appointed by the Director General of Police. ""
According to him, the responsibility of politicians, directly the minister and state secretaries, is both subjective and objective. ""Subjective, if not elsewhere, in that they did nothing to prevent these things from happening. And objective because they are responsible for every act that their subordinates do illegally or improperly.""
He cited a staffing case where a man being tried for mobbing in the workplace was tried to be recruited and three key people left in connection - the head of the police director general's office and two heads of internal investigations. ""That means three people withdrew and then that person was able to get a job.""
Interestingly, Baković explained that one of the first victims of political staffing was actually Anton Travner. ""According to his statements, he resigned for personal reasons. He was at sea that day, sailing on holiday. Imagine how this happened - he remembered while sailing and decided to do quite a bit. Probably by phone or whatever, he sent a resignation letter to the Minister, and then he sailed on. that he resigned because these house searches took place, and what was left for Mr. Travner other than to say that he was resigning for personal reasons? He has no choice but to say that he is resigning for personal reasons. On holiday, at a time when we are having a good time and not thinking about work. And this is one of the key and interesting victims that has happened. ""
According to Baković, the current government does not tolerate criticism and tries to deal with anyone who is critical. ""This is also shown by the dismissal of a long-serving police officer from the reserve auxiliary police, whom I personally know and know to be top-notch. How he was ordered to pay for the money he received from the address for a year readiness. How they did with Mr. Gantar when he expressed his things on Twitter. They are doing all this in order to silence this shot and to influence others so as not to raise their heads and say anything else! ""
The National Assembly then rejected the conclusions of the interim report of the commission of inquiry into political interference in the police with 44 votes against and 42 votes in favor. The National Assembly also did not confirm the essential findings of the interim report. In the coalition ranks, they said the report was unprofessional, misleading and damaging, and would not pass legal scrutiny. They also accuse the opposition that the commission is only dealing with a brutal showdown with political competition.
Let's remember
The parliamentary commission of inquiry adopted an interim report on 10 January. At the time, the chairman of the commission, Medved, said that the examination of 20 witnesses and the review of documents confirmed that things were going on in the Slovenian police at the behest of politics. According to him, the police system is being systematically cleaned up and certain pre-trial procedures are being systematically intervened, especially those that affect officials of the ruling politics.
In the interim report, the commission proposed to the National Assembly that it adopt two resolutions after the report, namely that the National Assembly propose to the Minister of the Interior to resign as Minister, and that the Government dismiss both State Secretaries at the Ministry of the Interior. internal affairs - Franc Kangler and Božo Predalič. MP Dejan Kaloh (SDS) and Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti (SNS) gave a separate opinion on the interim report.
The commission's final report is expected to be completed by the end of its term."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/ostri-odzivi-na-sporazum-o-visjih-placah-zdravnikov-datum-podpisa-sporazuma-se-ni-znan.html,"In the part of the opposition, there is indignation over the agreement on raising the salaries of doctors","After the government gave the green light yesterday to the signing of an agreement on raising doctors' salaries, worth 113.5 million euros, other public sector unions are boiling. According to SD MP Marko Koprivec, the disagreement of other unions is completely understandable. ""Such a way of raising wages is unacceptable and leads to the planned demolition of the wage system,"" Koprivc said. The Left is also outraged at how easily the government ""capitulated to blackmailing the highest paid doctors"".","SD MP Marko Koprivc estimates that the government, with an agreement with doctors, is destroying and destroying the pay system and introducing disunity into Slovenian society. He noted that many other professions in the public sector do not even reach the minimum wage. And instead of raising the salaries of those who have the least, the government is raising the salaries of those who already receive higher salaries - these are doctors who will now have a monthly gross salary of 5,000 instead of 4,000 euros. Therefore, in Koprivč's opinion, the government clearly does not understand what social dialogue is.
His parliamentary colleague Dejan Židan is also critical of the agreement initialed by the Ministry of Health and the Fides medical union this week, which was also approved by the government yesterday. He wonders who will provide the extra money in the health fund for the higher cost of doctors ’salaries. If no one does, it will mean 100 to 200 million euros less patient services.
""Given that doctors' salaries will be higher by more than 25 percent, have they at least ensured that patients in public hospitals in need of care are also cared for? And that doctors will not go to work in other institutions in the afternoon?"" asks Zidan.
Outraged in Left: Government easily capitulated to blackmailing top-paid doctors
They are also critical of the Left, where they believe it capitulated to blackmailing top-paid doctors and FIDES. According to them, raising the salary ceiling for the best paid doctors is a spit in the face of almost 30,000 health workers, nurses and other health workers and associates who have been working in literally wartime conditions for months.

The Left is aware that there is a shortage of medical staff, but in their opinion it is necessary to know why and where it is lacking. ""The shortage is mainly of family doctors, and the reason lies in the incorrect planning of staff development and specializations that were tendered according to the prestige of the industry, and not according to existing needs,"" they said.
According to them, the proposal represents a final blow to the already thoroughly started public sector salary scale and is a gift for the best paid doctors. On the other hand, this will not bring any benefits to young doctors, let alone nurses, carers and other underpaid and overburdened staff who are on the front lines of the fight against the epidemic.
They add that as many as 46 doctors were on the list of the 50 highest payments in the country in September last year. The highest salary paid was € 15,344 gross, which the best paid doctor earned while performing three jobs together.
The date of the signing is still unknown, other public sector unions are on their feet
It is unknown at this time what he will do after leaving the post. This is not disclosed either in Fidesz or in the ministry. Until the signing, the content of the agreement will obviously not be officially disclosed. According to unofficial information, the salary of doctors is expected to increase by six salary grades, which means a 24 percent higher salary.
However, it is already clear that doctors will be able to exceed the 57th salary grade - this has been the salary ceiling for public sector employees who are not officials. Thus, they will now be able to reach the 63rd salary grade, which brings in a good 5,000 euros gross salary. This is a temporary increase in the salary ceiling for doctors, as the law stipulates that this measure may be valid until the end of this year.
As a result of these moves by the government, public sector unions have remained on their feet and are demanding equal treatment, ie an increase in wages by six pay grades or by 24 percent. Strikes are already being discussed in many unions, confirmed Jakob Počivavšek, head of the negotiating team for public sector unions.
Frančišek Verk, president of the State Administration Trade Union, said on Tuesday that we are witnessing particular interests and separate agreements. Branimir Štrukelj, Secretary General of Sviza, said: ""It is not possible that the government is not aware that this unilateral move has fundamentally shaken the wage system.""
Even in the union of professional firefighters boils. Their representative, David Schwartz, says: ""The boys and girls are angry, they expect us to start activities in the union to deal fairly with the valuation of their jobs.""
Fidesz: The foundations of the single wage system have been torn down by other unions
Fidesz also responded to the critical voices of other public sector unions and politicians. ""We wonder how these same MEPs who are running for office will show citizens solutions for accessible and efficient public health. Perhaps by pushing doctors into a single pay system whose foundations are not merely shaken, to paraphrase. the head of the trade union confederation, Branimir Štrukelj, but they have been gone for a long time because these same unions demolished them themselves, ""they wrote on the union's website.
According to them, the latest blow was the conclusion of an annex for more than 35,000 health care workers, which represents a permanent increase in salaries, weighing about 123 million, and no concern was expressed about how the announced temporary increase in doctors' salaries will affect the public coffers.
""The fact is that doctors are already leaving this pay system and following the offer of the market and getting employed outside the public health system or abroad. Soon the doctors will leave on their own and neither unions nor politicians will have any influence. healthcare as we know it and as politics is supposed to advocate is just an illusion, which we can be sure of by looking at countries not far from us, ""Fidesz added."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/policijske-preiskave.html,Goznikar denies sending threatening letters with ammunition,"The police are said to have enough evidence that Teodor Goznikar from Celje, an outspoken supporter of the government and a member of the SNS party, is behind the consignments of ammunition received by high-ranking representatives of the current government and its allies. Goznikar denied sending the bullets and said he was in shock. He confirmed, however, that Celje police officers interviewed him two days ago as one of the seven suspects in the case. SNS President Zmago Jelinčič claimed that Goznikar had not been a member of the party since yesterday.","Teodor Goznikar is allegedly suspected of sending threatening letters to politicians via the mailbox in Trojane, which he himself denies. As he explained to Večer, the police really interviewed him, ""because I was recorded on one of the security cameras some time ago, when I was buying donuts in Trojane, which I do many times. I have nothing to do with sending these threatening letters."" He added that DNA samples were taken from him at the Celje Police Administration and he was released after questioning.
It also seems strange to him that his name appeared in some media so soon after the interrogation at the Police, ""who apparently already had a story about me ready in advance, which is not true."" ""Confidential information about criminal investigations, when we are only talking about suspects, is obviously leaking from the Celje Police Administration to some media,"" he added. We also tried to get in touch with him, but so far without success.
SNS President Zmago Jelinčič has already responded to the events, saying that he was ""totally in shock"". Jelinčič assured us that Goznikar was never his right hand man, and added that although he was a member of the party, he never had a visible function in it. ""Now we have removed him from the party on the basis of media news and he is no longer our member,"" Jelinčič added, adding that they were waiting for the official results of the investigation.
In the Slovenian National Party (SNS), we are shocked and appalled by the actions of our member Teodor Goznikar, which we learned from the media. We strongly condemn such excessive actions and judge that they do not fall within the framework of democratic political participation in the country.
According to certain allusions of some media, we declare that Mr. Goznikar was not a right-hand man of the party president, just as he was not a member of any party body. He was a member of the Slovenian National Party.
We are, of course, expecting an official notification of the event and the sanctioning of Mr. Goznikar, whose membership in the Slovenian National Party ended yesterday, ie on 2 February 2022. We will not make any further statements until the matter has been officially notified and clarified.
But the fact that it is not just one member of the party but actually Jelinčič's colleague, in addition to online traces, is indicated by an e-mail that Goznikar recently sent to our house on behalf of the SNS champion, with video material about a new threatening letter received by Jelinčič.
""Who cares if the information came to light just before the house searches began?""
""Only ruthless authoritarian authorities are abusing their supporters to threaten themselves with death, and of course they are using this to confront political opponents,"" said LMI MP Rudi Medved, adding that LMS already had such an act at the time it happened. condemned. ""We can ask ourselves whether we are affected because apparently the ruling politics has upset the citizens with this severe manipulation and wanted to make a victim of itself,"" he added, adding that it is now clear who the victim is. ""They dumped the man they abused at first, but now things are moving forward by opening up even more questions.""
He praised the work of police officers and criminal investigators that they succeeded so quickly in the investigation. ""Of course, the big question is whether they will be able to continue this investigation effectively in this way. If the information is true, house searches are expected in the coming days,"" he said, wondering how it was possible that information was leaked to the media just before the investigation began. ""In the pro-government media, on the Siol.net portal,"" he pointed out, wondering who was interested in it.
""Has politics intervened here? For now, I'm just asking questions to reveal any connections with possible quick house searches. Did this suspect send the threats just out of pure peace or did someone order it? Of course, no one believes that ""He would do it just like that, on his own. So who cares if the information came to light just before the house searches? That some traces may be hidden, some links leading to politics,"" he said, adding that that they cannot prejudge anything at this time. ""However, the tweet of the suspect with some prominent representatives of the authorities shows that people know each other, that they share the same values,"" he added, listing ministers Matej Tonin and Vinko Gorenak.
""Since the transfer took place last autumn, this is a period still under the jurisdiction of the commission of inquiry into suspected political involvement in the work of the police, so we will certainly open this issue at the commission of inquiry, especially if it turns out that these were the alleged planned house searches in the coming days are hampered in any way, ”he announced, adding that this will also be at the heart of the commission of inquiry.
He also emphasized that all the publicly announced positions of the suspect show that he supports the current government. ""It is quite unusual that the pro-government media is certainly releasing this information to the public for some political reasons, but for example, the SNS president was so upset that he immediately expelled him from the party and distanced himself from him. that the ruling politics could use a person to send these death threats, ”he said.
He reminded that at the time when the politicians received the letters, there were some ""strange"" stories about who and who did not receive the letter. "" ""All these letters remained in the mail. No one got him home. For now, he is telling us that this was one big manipulation,"" he said.
He also pointed out the unknown source of the ammunition, as it is military ammunition. According to him, this is also a matter that requires investigation.
""In this way, they tried to portray themselves as victims.""
""I'm not going to say it's expected because no one needed to know who was sending it. But from day one, it seemed to me that they were trying to picture themselves as victims in this way and that the whole thing was set up to they would discredit their opponent, as they do day by day, ""said Luka Mesec, coordinator of the Left Party.
""They write to themselves, draw, paint, tin, send, threaten and, of course, make sacrifices,"" commented Matjaž Nemec from SD.
Any threat to anyone is unacceptable in our country and is strongly condemned by the party, the SAB said. They reiterated that shipments would be intercepted at post centers in accordance with protocols. We said at the time that this led us to the least intentional irresponsible behavior or even more. The police apparently found the perpetrator, and the fact that he is now a former member of the SNS, who has been assisting the government all the time, confirms The government would like to portray itself as a victim of repressive measures. it gets an epilogue sooner, ”they have already stated in response to our questions.
""All threats must be taken seriously and have zero tolerance for them. Congratulations to the Police for professionally conducting an investigation into recent letter shipments. The time for conclusions will be after the end of the competent authorities' proceedings,"" NSi President Matej Tonin wrote. He later told a news conference that he wanted the police to find this individual and take appropriate action against him. ""I asked the director general of the police, Anton Olaj, about this. He said that he could not confirm the information at the moment, but that the police would properly complete this investigation and present the data to the public.""
Gregor Perič, the leader of the Concrete parliamentary group, also thanked the Police for their professional, dedicated and quick response in the investigation of threatening letters. ""We must give the perpetrators of such atrocities enough time to reflect on their actions in the relevant institutions,"" he added.
The leader of the parliamentary group of unaffiliated deputies, Janja Sluga, estimated that if the information turned out to be true, it would not be a surprise. ""Pointing the finger at NGOs has now turned out to be untrue and it has also turned out that these threats were the prelude to the tightening of legislation on insulting politicians,"" she said.
DS President Alojz Kovšca expressed indignation over the fact that the alleged suspect was in the past the recipient of the DS plaque for volunteering. In his opinion, such actions exceed the limits of common sense, and politics in Slovenia, in his opinion, drops ""to the level of political arson"".
On Wednesday, Interior Minister Aleš Hojs congratulated the police on their work.
Prime Minister Janez Janša wrote that Goznikar was a supporter of the LMŠ party rather than the SDS party, sharing a screenshot of Goznikar congratulating the LMŠ party on its electoral success in the European elections in 2019. Janša also pointed out Goznikar's alleged support for the SD and the sharing of articles by the Mladina newspaper.
Who is Teodor Goznikar?
During the current government, Teodor Goznikar was appointed commander of the municipal civil protection headquarters in Celje. As explained to us by the Administration of the Republic of Slovenia for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief, he took office on 10 September 2020 and held it until 3 December 2021, when he resigned.
In March last year, on the occasion of Civil Protection Day, he received an award, namely the bronze CZ badge. The proposer for the bronze badge was the Municipality of Celje, Mayor Bojan Šrot, who gave the following justification: In less than a year, he has seen quite a few successes, which are the result of both primary and indirect tasks of civil protection. that Teodor Groznikar deserves the bronze badge of the Civil Protection. ""
In August last year, he was praised by the SNS for helping rescuers rescue a man who began drowning due to a reckless jump into the Savinja.
His name was also mentioned on POP TV in 2019, in connection with the information that Slovenia will erect an additional 40 kilometers of panel fences with cutting wire on the border with Croatia. The deal, worth four and a half million, was awarded to the Serbian company Legi SGS in a public tender.
The documentation for the company was submitted by Goznikar, who was considered Jelinčič's right hand man, so there were speculations as to whether the company's choice to erect the fence was transparent. In 2019, for example, they laid a wreath in front of Tito's monument.
Goznikar was also an honorary member of the Slovenian Police Union (SPS) at the time when he was led by Zoran Petrovič, with whom he was close. He was later deprived of his membership or expelled from the trade union for acting contrary to the basic principles and damaging the reputation and interests of the trade union. ""We do not know how and why this person was an honorary member of the Slovenian Police Union, except that he was one of the founding members in 2008,"" says Kristjan Mlekuš, president of the SPS.
He explained that Goznikar in 2017 or. In 2018, after the disciplinary procedure, he was expelled as an honorary member of the SPS, as he acted to the detriment of the trade union. ""Namely, as the secretary of the Police Association (although he was never a police officer), she demanded that the Police Union pay the Association a license to use the coat of arms, names and symbols registered with the Intellectual Property Office in 2008. he has not yet been registered as a legal entity, ""he explained, adding that SPS then proved in a civil law dispute the ownership of a trademark, which was transferred to SPS on the basis of a court decision.
""As we assessed at the time that it was blackmailing to pay money and causing direct damage to the union, disciplinary proceedings were instituted, based on which it was established that the person was acting contrary to the basic principles of the union and trying to harm him,"" he added. explained, and after the disciplinary proceedings, Groznikar was expelled from the SPS. At that time, they ended the story with that person, and they also have ""absolutely no contact"" with him.
As previously reported, Goznikar has repeatedly publicly supported the current government on social media and sharply attacked its opponents, opposition and protesters. At a time when politicians have informed the public that they have received shipments of ammunition and threatening letters, he commented on both the sending of ammunition and the investigation. ""Mr. German, I'm not going to write 'dear,' because I don't mean that at the moment. Because of posts like yours, some people get courage and think they're allowed to do anything. And obviously you support things like Yesterday's letters. They drew the target over my forehead. It's not funny! "" for example, he wrote in a comment below Jelinčič's post.
Among his friends on Facebook we can also find deputies from the SNS and SDS parties, including Zmago Jelinčič, Alenko Jeraj, Franc Kangler, Žan Mahnič, Zvone Černač and even the Director General of the Police Anton Olaj.
Let's remember
At least six leading politicians have received a shipment of death threats. In addition to Prime Minister Janez Janša and Defense Minister Matej Tonin, they also received Interior Minister Aleš Hojs, SNS Party President Zmago Jelinčič and two parliamentary groups in the National Assembly, the SNS and Desus. It is also interesting how the mail got to the addressees. The Post Office claimed at the time that they had complied with the protocols."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/preiskava-o-ugotavljanju-zlorab-v-zadevi-kangler-brez-napredka.html,Investigation into the Kangler abuse case without progress,"The National Assembly did not accept the report of the commission of inquiry into the abuses in the Kangler case. He also did not support the commission's proposed decisions, which would forward the report to the National Investigation Office and the Specialized Public Prosecutor's Office, among other things, as a report of suspected criminal offenses.","Today, the National Assembly discussed the report and the additional report of the commission of inquiry into the abuses in the case of Franc Kangler and others, which ended its work in December. As the head of the parliamentary commission Dejan Kaloh (SDS) pointed out in the introduction, the commission pursued several goals in its work. Among other things, it investigated the circumstances that indicate possible procedural violations in the proceedings against Franc Kangler, as well as the possible political responsibility of the public officials who were allegedly involved in the prosecution of Kangler.
According to Kaloh, based on the testimonies of witnesses and obtained documents, the commission unequivocally concluded that the prosecution against Kangler in 24 criminal cases was very likely politically motivated and the consequence of Maribor getting a right-wing mayor in 2006. According to the commission, there are also several indications that there are serious suspicions of careless and non-transparent conduct by the police in the Kangler case.
As Soniboj Knežak pointed out in the presentation of the position of the SD parliamentary group, SD deputies did not participate in the commission of inquiry because it was clear from the very beginning that the investigation into specific decisions and actions of state prosecutors and their responsibility with the constitution. According to the Social Democrats, this is an inadmissible and unconstitutional interference in the work of state prosecutors and could be extremely dissuasive, Knežak warned.
The leader of the SAB parliamentary group, Maša Kociper, made a similar point. As she pointed out, the SAB decided not to participate in the commission when it was formed, because they had several concerns about the legality and constitutionality of its work. According to the SAB, the work of such a commission means a very violent interference of the legislative branch of government in the work of the judiciary and the prosecutor's office, which is inadmissible and contrary to the principle of legal certainty. They find it particularly problematic when it comes to policy influences.
Lešt MP Koštija also reminded that in October 2019 the Constitutional Court partially suspended the implementation of the said commission of inquiry. According to the Left, the sole purpose of setting up the commission of inquiry was ""an attempt at the political rehabilitation of a certain political functionary"", as evidenced by the political composition of the commission, which included four SDS members and one NSi member.
NSi MP Tadeja Šuštar Zalar disputed the opinion of the Left. She highlighted several findings from the commission's report, including that the police did not maintain an adequate level of secrecy in obtaining and evaluating information when initiating proceedings against Kangler. ""It appears that the data processing involved the possibility of organized discrediting of Mayor Franc Kangler,"" she stressed.
On behalf of the SDS parliamentary group, SDS MP Anja Bah Žibert drew attention to the commission's report that the abuses of the police, prosecutor's office and courts in Maribor in Kangler's case were so extensive and continuous that it was very likely that a very successful right-wing politician in Maribor coordinated and promoted by someone from the top of state politics in conjunction with his local political opponents ”. According to the findings of the commission, in the opinion of the SDS, it should be considered to restrict access to individual records or. personal data of individuals where this access is not strictly necessary for the performance of police work.
Other parliamentary groups did not present their views today."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kritje-visjih-plac-zdravnikov-letos-verjetno-iz-proracuna-kaj-pa-v-prihodnje.html,"Higher salaries of doctors this year are probably covered from the budget, but what about in the future?","With the increase in doctors' salaries, which is expected to amount to 110 million euros annually, the question arises as to who will cover this. The health insurance fund warns that they do not have their own resources for the increasing burdens imposed by politics. The latest intervention law to mitigate the effects of the epidemic stipulates that the increase in doctors' salaries will be covered by the state budget, but only until the end of this year.","The Fides Medical Union and the Ministry of Health do not comment on the details of the agreement before the official conclusion of the negotiations. The agreement is expected to cost around 110 million euros, but according to unofficial information, the salaries of most doctors will increase by six classes, and some specialists by seven. One salary class means an increase of about 4% in salary, which means that the agreement would bring doctors 24 or. 28% salary increase.
However, the new maximum limit for doctors is the 63rd pay grade, which is now reserved only for officials. So far, other civil servants have been able to reach a maximum of 57th salary grade.
Raising the salary ceiling for doctors and dentists is otherwise allowed by the Tenth Intervention Act. Article 48 stipulates that doctors may reach a maximum of 63 pay grades, which is envisaged for the period until the end of the year. In addition, the Intervention Act stipulates that the state budget covers higher liabilities of the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia (ZZZS) due to the increase in salaries in health care, but this is only valid this year.
Could lower salaries be paid to doctors again next year?
This raises the question of whether raising salaries and the salary ceiling for doctors is just a measure for this year or will it continue in the future, so it will be permanent. The ministry and Fidesz are not giving any explanations or comments on the agreement at the moment. On its website, Fides emphasizes that the subject of negotiations is exclusively the content of the annex to the special tariff part of the collective agreement for doctors and dentists as the implementation of a provision in the said intervention law.
The president of the Pergam confederation and the head of the negotiating team of the public sector unions, Jakob Počivavšek, said on Tuesday that there was no such time limit in the agreement reached. But even if the duration of the salary increase were limited to this year, the question is which of the politicians would dare to re-award old salaries to doctors next year.
ZZZS: The policy must provide financial resources for all new obligations in health care
The Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia has been warning for some time that they do not have their own resources for all new obligations in health care imposed by politics. These have accumulated in recent months for more than 300 million euros. Last year's increase in salaries in nursing alone amounted to around 90 million euros, and an annex to last year's general agreement costs the health fund around 66 million euros. Last week, the National Assembly adopted a reduction in the length of sick pay, which is borne by the employer, which will bring additional costs of around 80 to 90 million euros to the health fund on an annual basis. In addition, salaries for doctors are clearly rising significantly, followed by negotiations for other health care professions.
Meanwhile, in accordance with the intervention law, the budget covers only the costs of absence due to covid-19 among health professionals, costs related to covid-19 and raising salaries to individual occupational groups in health care, the ZZZS warns, adding that this only applies this year .
Therefore, they expect that the National Assembly will increase the maximum possible use of funds this year and that it will provide systemic resources to cover all new obligations. Thus, they propose that the amendment to the law should provide a permanent budgetary safeguard according to the principle that applies to the pension fund. This state budget covers the deficit for the current year.
We are still waiting for the answers of the Ministry of Finance on how all the higher costs of the health insurance fund will be financed in the future."

The programmatic starting points will revolve around three principles - what is good for the economy, for people and nature. They are convinced of a good result in the elections.","By signing, the five parties undertook to form the best list of candidates under the name Let's Connect Slovenia, which will provide them with all the necessary infrastructure. The party presidents will take unanimous decisions on the formation of a joint parliamentary team and cooperation with the Allies after the elections. The contract they signed is valid for a certain period of time, until the end of the next term of the National Assembly.
In a statement at the signing, SLS President Marjan Podobnik said that they wanted to create the kind of Slovenia that was voted for in the plebiscite on independence. According to him, everyone is invited to participate, and they will also address everyone. “No one will be left alone,” he said.
The president of the party Konkretno and the Minister of Economy Zdravko Počivalšek emphasized that they had shown in the movement that they were able to overcome the differences that existed between the signatories and look to the future. ""If we want to put Slovenia at the top of the global chain of success, we must show that we are serious about the new political form. Instead of a split, we need cooperation,"" he said.
The President of the Greens of Slovenia Andrej Čuš also pointed out the cooperation. He noted that environmental policy has not had people looking for common solutions for the past 30 years. According to him, water, air and our living space are being poisoned daily, and in his opinion this is the current situation in the temple of democracy.
The president of the NLS and the state secretary at the Ministry of the Interior, Franc Kangler, assessed that the political spasm that is present before the elections is harming the economy and citizens. ""Therefore, it is the responsibility of all those who feel called to create the future of politics in Slovenia, to create a dialogue, to unite and not exclude anyone in the future,"" he concluded.
The president of the New Social Democrats, Andrej Magajna, said that today's signing of the agreement reminds him of the signing of the Demos presidency 30 years ago. He added that the Social Democrats were adding new colors to the movement. He emphasized the values ​​of the National Liberation War, which was the legitimate right of the nation to defend itself against the occupier, and described the partisan movement as an act of patriotism. “We knew how to connect, to come together in 41 and 91 when we were threatened and that should be a guide going forward,” he concluded.
Marko Balažic became the official speaker of the movement, saying that we expelled reason from Slovenia and gave priority to evil. So they joined a movement that wants a more tolerant society where they can talk and be respectful, where the rules are the same for everyone.
The initiator of the movement, Nada Pavšer, said that they want to build the path on the basis of three pillars of sustainable development, which are the people's social pillar, the green pillar and the liberal-economic pillar. She emphasized that a very broad consensus was needed if this sustainable aspect was to be put into practice and practice.
The signing of the agreement was also attended by DS President and Vice President Alojz Kovšca, former State Secretary at the Ministry of Health and doctor Tina Bregant, adviser in the President's Office and former Constitutional Court Judge Ernest Petrič and Minister of Education Simona Kustec.
Let's connect Slovenia will form a single list in the elections, but the seats for individual parties will not be clearly defined. In each district, the one who is the best according to opinion polls will run. ""All parties have decided that all five will follow the one who will be recognized as the best and mutually support him,"" Balazic explained after the event. Čuš, however, said that they correspond geographically, which was a ""great relief"".
Thus, the parties will not have the same number of candidates. They also point out that non-party candidates will also be able to run on the list. Kangler said there are big differences in the number of candidates from each party, ""but it's not disturbing for anyone."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/kdo-obvladuje-slovenske-gozdove.html,"Two billion euros in state forests, among the private reigns the Church","Slovenia is covered by almost 60 percent of the forest, making it one of the top European countries, behind Finland and Sweden. One-fifth of the forest is owned by the state, and thus two billion euros. For former Minister of Agriculture Dejan Židan, the fact that so many forests have been denationalized is a great shame. Most of the forest area, just under 80 percent, is privately owned, or - we have as many as 413 thousand forest owners. The largest private owner is the Roman Catholic Church. Do we know how to manage forests? Who controls them?","We asked forest owners about the market situation - from the smallest to the largest, who manage the forest for profit. Rok Sedminek from the Association of Slovenian Owners has been the owner of the farm for more than 10 years, and the forest, which he largely manages together with his father, represents half of the farm's income. In the last ten years, they have been selling in Slovenia to Slovenian sawmills. ""When I started with the forest, the price was half. Our sawmills made a 'fool' of our raw material. When they first started selling abroad, our prices also approached those abroad. Since then, we are equal, especially with Austria. . ""
Janez Medved, according to the local Brudarjev Janez, is a charcoal burner who built the largest charcoal kiln in Europe this year. On the family farm, they have half the income from the forests. He agrees with Sedmink that wood prices are ridiculously low, given that beech has been growing for 100 years.
Dragica Šahtler has been dealing with forests on the family farm for more than 25 years. They farm on a good hundred hectares of forests and ten hectares of agricultural land. They sell wood mainly to domestic buyers. ""Until recently, wood was very devalued, now the prices of wood assortments have improved a little, but wood, as an important strategic raw material, should reach an even higher price and above all it should be placed as an important building material, even for making the best furniture. "" He points out that as much as a third of forests are protective, in addition to a lot of maintenance expenditures, special machinery. The result is a minimum income. ""That is why we are often saddened when private forest owners are portrayed as careless, ignorant, not knowing where they have their forests. We do not know such owners. We also cannot agree that forests are not managed or that the unrealized potential remains unrealized. However, we find that the felling is absolutely too high, given the large negative impact of wildlife for our area. investment. That's what only careful masters do and do! ""
For Marjan Hren, president of the Association of Forest Owners, a four-hectare forest represents a third of the income. They use firewood at home, and sell about 10 to 15 cubic meters of wood annually. ""However, the forest is an important source of income for the existence of our farm, which is a part of the mosaic of the cultural landscape of Slovenia."" He manages the forest himself, which he learned from his father. ""Because we sell to a neighbor who has wood processing, we have virtually everything at hand when it comes to marketing."" The farm as such, together with the forest, certainly has the potential for one or two solid jobs, the possibility of tourism and beekeeping, ie a complementary activity. ""I don't know where the future business environment in Slovenia will go, but if it also goes in the direction of creating added value on the basis of green jobs in rural areas, then our four-hectare forest estate is also an important additional basis.""
Disconnection of private owners
The majority of forests - 77 percent - are privately owned in Slovenia, with a very small number of forest owners, which reduces the optimal use of wood in private forests.
There are 413,000 forest owners in Slovenia, who own 286,000 forest estates. But when we talk about the management of private forests, we are talking about 150 thousand owners who control 90 percent of private property, explains Marjan Hren. The average size of privately owned forest land is 2.9 hectares, according to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food.
According to Nika Krajnc from the Forestry Institute of Slovenia, this ownership fragmentation is the main reason why it is very complex to bring larger quantities of wood to the end user. ""More than 60 percent of the wood that is felled comes from private forests. Felling, especially in private forests, lags behind possible felling according to forest management plans and amounts to 70 percent of possible felling and 40 percent of current increment."" Rok Sedminek does not see the problem of ownership fragmentation. ""More than 30 percent of owners are serious about forest management, wood means income to them. We should connect and help small owners. We can only compete with quality, not quantity.""
The Archdiocese of Ljubljana owns 2 percent of Slovenia's forests
The largest private owner is the Roman Catholic Church, especially the Archdiocese of Ljubljana. The church forests of the Ljubljana Archdiocese in Gorenjska are managed by the Bled Forestry (GG Bled), one of the largest forest companies in Slovenia. GG Bled is owned by the Archdiocese of Ljubljana through the Metropolitana company. The Agricultural Land Fund paid the Archdiocese of Ljubljana EUR 34 million in compensation for the inability to use it.
The church forests of the Ljubljana Archdiocese cover about 20,000 hectares, which is 2 percent of Slovenian forests. The Novo mesto Diocese also manages its forests of more than 3,000 hectares through the Beneficij company. GG Bled comes from old forest holdings that managed forests before the 1990s, and is one of the few that remains. It carries out the felling, harvesting and purchase of timber and then sells the timber to the timber industry. ""In 2021, we cut down and bought about a third of the wood in Germany, Italy and Croatia,"" explains Marko Matjašič, General Manager of GG Bled.
As extremely small forest owners, who own less than one hectare, predominate, the key question is how to motivate private owners to manage the forest. ""The question to which we do not yet have a clear answer is how much forest a certain owner should own in order for the forest to be a source of livelihood,"" says Nike Krajnc. ""As a rule, smaller forest owners do not even appear on the market."" He adds that the attitude of small owners towards the forest is different - from a very emotional attachment, to not even knowing where they have the forest.
Private owners should act together in the market
""The biggest challenge for a large sawmill in Slovenia is how to organize forest owners to get wood. In our country, most wood is sold on a truck road, we have quite a few buyers or companies that specialize in buying wood on a truck road and then selling to saws , ""adds Krajnčeva. If forest owners organized and entered the market together, one redundant member of these traffickers could fall away and owners could achieve higher market prices. According to her, the owners should join some cooperatives, which would sell them together in larger quantities or also organize the implementation of felling, harvesting, because small owners sometimes do not find themselves in the search for contractors.
The Slovenian Wood Association (Sloles) points out the problem because most private forest owners sell logs through intermediaries who are not qualified at all and take advantage of legal uncertainty in this area. ""Among the current intermediaries are also a large number of speculative traders in logs, which they buy from private forest owners, and in most cases it does not end at the Slovenian sawmill. to sell the logs to the Slovenian processing industry. "" He adds that Slovenian processors are definitely ready to buy logs regularly from forest owners throughout the year.
Rok Sedminek, the owner of just under 30 hectares of forest, is also calling on the state: ""If the Slovenian government allocates as much money as it has for SiDG, we are connected in one year, we can start working."" Without integration, it will not work in the future. ""An individual can succeed, but most of us can't succeed individually.""
Supply from the private sector is most questionable in our country, says Nike Krajnc. ""In our country, felling was very high from 2014 to 2018 because there were icebreakers, windbreaks and then a leopard. Binding decisions forced forest owners to work, so felling was higher. In 2020 and 2021, when there were no more There were not many unfortunates and wolverines, the felling has dropped significantly, we are reaching the level of four million fellings gross. The problem is the motivation that is falling. Some had to cut a lot then, but now they will not for the next ten years. ""
Dragica Šahtler says that there are cases when owners cooperate well in sales, whether they are neighbors or smaller groups of owners. The current free presence on the market allows the owner to sell the wood to whom he wants to sell it, at his own discretion and at the best price. ""This, of course, requires caution, business acumen and ingenuity, as well as diligence, which are already the virtues of a capable entrepreneurial owner, which the owners must definitely remain.""
Marjan Hren, that we need more professional teams that realistically assess the owner's costs and return on sales. ""In the recent Slovenian past, some intermediaries with an unfair business relationship, especially carriers, have done a lot of damage.""
Sedminek adds that only active forest owners will reduce the impact of climate change. At the same time, he points out that the ownership of forests in Slovenia is at the bottom. ""If I come to you in the yard, I'll ask if I can go through."" Without their permission, various sports activities are carried out in the forest. ""I'm afraid they'll tell us in the future to get the horse out of the woods.""
Private forest owners point out that SiDG represents unfair competition
At the time of its establishment, SiDG's intention was to increase the share of state forests, especially special-purpose forests, reserves, and protected forests. ""The fact that we only have 20 percent and that everything else has gone into denationalisation is a great shame. In fact, I hope that those who have passed such legislation are ashamed. Most European countries have a significantly higher share of state forest because it is natural wealth, but in Slovenia it was immediately distributed. It is right that natural wealth is increasing, and last but not least, how many animal and plant species will survive depends on the forest, and much more, ""said Dejan Židan, former Minister of Agriculture. .
The accusation that the state-owned forest is growing is wrong, claims Židan. ""When there is force, there is no one who can quickly buy bad logs, the cooperatives cannot do that. If SiDG got the opportunity to help private owners by buying wood, which is mostly of poorer quality, it is good for Slovenia. The worst thing is that private owners get stuck with bad wood. "" SiDG CEO Robert Tomazin says that in the past SiDG has not bought from private individuals, and in 2022 it will take an active part in this area.
However, Rok Sedminek adds that SiDG's trend lately is to use unfair competition with private money to private forest owners. ""The price is set for several years ahead, there is a more than 25% price difference between SiDG and the private sector. They come to the market with larger quantities."" On the other hand, the state had no interest in organizing private owners. ""Sawmills could seriously talk about the amount of wood they would get. The wood could be processed at home, not that we sell raw abroad.""
Branko Tomažič, a member of the Commission for Agriculture, Forestry and Food in the National Council, also opposes SiDG buying from and competing with surrounding farmers. ""If he has more than 30 hectares, according to the SiDG Forest Act, he has a priority right of purchase over the farmer. We opposed this. We would like farms to remain in the highlands. which is not right. ""
The state, worth two billion forests, is managed by SiDG
It was almost six years ago when a policy led by the then SD Minister of Agriculture Dejan Židan decided to entrust the management of state forests to the new company SiDG. The state-owned company, in which the taxpayers invested 22 million euros at the time of its establishment, manages 235,000 hectares of forest and supplies the wood industry with wood. Approximately 50,000 trucks are transported from state forests annually.
The key question today, however, is whether the investment has paid off for the state? Zidan is satisfied. ""The death trap for SiDG would be if, at the suggestion of the people who wasted veneer production, it was SiDG that started doing it."" SiDG ends the year with a profit, in 2021 it amounted to a record 14 million euros.
Decision-makers should look for ideas for the development of society in Bavaria, suggests Židan. ""Let them look at the Bavarian model and see how it is easiest and most transparent to work.""
Is a state monopoly emerging?
However, sawmills and product manufacturers in Sloles are more critical of the operation of SiDG. ""Currently, a 'state monopoly' in this area is being accelerated and planned. By expanding SiDG to buy from private individuals, the company is moving away from its basic purpose and creating a monopoly position."" According to them, SiDG should focus on the management of state forests and the sale of raw materials from these forests. They estimate that ""SiDG is somehow separating from us, becoming the essence of itself"".
Robert Tomazin argues that any fear of becoming a monopolist is unnecessary. ""In a way, we offer security to the Slovenian private owner. We also want to be a reliable partner to the Slovenian wood processing industry. practices, it also fights us as a partner or competitor in the field. "" He adds that they want cooperation, not harassment. ""Because we are aware that we are very small players in the global, European or regional market.""
The key issue is the brand, as we can offer many things from Slovenian wood, ""otherwise we will still be slaves of foreign traders who skillfully sell Slovenian wood on the world market.""
What is the return of SiDG compared to 20-year concessions?
Prior to 2016, ie before the establishment of SiDG, state forests were managed by companies through concessions for 20 years, the Agricultural Land and Forests Fund reported, and later the fund transferred all forests to the management of SiDG. ""The fund still performs the task of transferring forests free of charge from previous holders of the right of use to state ownership and management of the fund, followed by transfer to SIDG,"" explains Aleš Tolar, v. d. the director of the fund.
In addition to agricultural land, the Fund is also the one that manages land restitution or denationalisation. From January 1996 to the end of 2020, 95,000 hectares of forests were returned. The Fund disbursed EUR 31 million for returned forests, and from 2003 to 2021 the Fund disbursed more than EUR 51 million for all returned lands (agricultural land and forests).
Židan says he did not understand why the state forest management was handed over to private initiative 20 years ago. ""I don't know why they decided on concessions where the state got too little per cubic meter of wood sold. When the concession period expired during my term, we had to look at how to proceed. We all knew that concessions were not good, so we whether to continue with them or to adopt a governance model as elsewhere. "" Židan is convinced that today the state gets significantly more per cubic meter of wood than in the past.
An important question - what was the return for the country at the time of concessions and today? SiDG boasts that the revenue for the country ranges from 20 to 29 million euros a year. However, the Commission for Agriculture, Forestry and Food of the National Council, which annually reviews the operations of SiDG and draws attention to irregularities, has found the opposite, says commission member Branko Tomažič. ""The yield was 14 to 15 percent worse than in previous years, so the state got even less than before through the concession system. The state does not get 27 euros per cubic meter of wood, as SiDG claimed, but 12 to 13 euros.""
Jože Podgoršek, Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Food, believes that the current method of managing state forests is more efficient and profitable. He adds that otherwise we would have to wait with the establishment of SiDG. ""The company was set up during the worst of the disasters, so it would probably be better to wait until the company is set up to repair the biggest damage.""
One of SiDG's returns is the forest fund, which was created for the first time when this state-owned company was founded. From 2016 to last year, SiDG paid 74 million euros into the forest fund, and as at 31 December 2021, 12 million euros were in the fund, according to data from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food.
The money from the forest fund is used for obtaining forests, government obligations in inheriting forests, promoting the use of wood and maintaining forest paths ... Private forests also receive funds, and the Forest Service supports the owners in preserving forests through the fund. In 2021, they received 750 thousand euros.
And how do individuals who have come to know the previous system comment on it? ""That wood is stolen, sold illegally and driven across the border. We warned that appropriate action is needed. When SiDG was established, we found many irregularities in accounting and financial statements for 2019,"" says Councilor Tomažič.
In Sloles, they say the concession system had some shortcomings, but it was a more business-friendly and significantly more reliable partner for supplying timber from state and private forests. Bruno Bizjak, director of Smart industries and a member of Sloles, adds that he is personally familiar with both systems, as they have worked extensively with former concessionaires. ""There have been ups and downs in the twenties. Their era is over, and rightly so."" They were among the first supporters of the establishment of SiDG, but as they say, not everything is going as they imagined. ""If we approach it correctly and listen to our advice, we have a good future of cooperation. The profession must give advice, not politics."" But SiDG must adhere to the guidelines on which it was established, he added. ""Recently, appetites have been emerging, and SiDG is focusing on logistics, buying vehicles, interfering in the manufacturing industry, which is not their point.""
Marko Matjašič believes that SiDG needs quite some time to be rationally organized, but it needs to be given the time that every organization needs. ""The fact is that previously forest holdings were significantly more productive or cost-effective. We must not forget that they employed a total of 2,000 people. It is also pointless to force SiDG into wood processing, which should be a matter for the private sector and not the state. ""
With processing centers, will SiDG displace existing sawmills?
Recently, we have seen attempts by SiDG or the state to move SIDG from the forest to other parts, according to Sloles. The government's plan envisages the construction of four wood centers in Carinthia, Primorska, Dolenjska and Štajerska. ""SiDG would not form wood centers, but would enter as a partner - up to 49 percent in capital or as a strategic supplier. Within a reasonable time - five to eight years - SiDG will withdraw from this partnership and move money or capital to some deficit production activities. "" In Sloles, they are against the creation of processing centers. ""Existing actors in the wood processing industry need to be supported and new ones interested.""
One of these centers is planned in the subsidiary Snežnik, which has been operating with a loss of 600 to 700 thousand euros since 2017 (with the exception of 2018). According to SiDG estimates, in 2021, unlike in previous years, Snežnik operated positively. SiDG first announced a tender for the selection of a strategic partner, two bids were received, and in the end SiDG decided to carry out the investment itself. As General Manager Tomazin explains, the government has proposed a recapitalization of Snežnik in the amount of 13 million euros in three steps - this year and next year five million euros a year, then another three million. ""We want to turn it into a modern wood processing center that will be a model of cooperation between forestry, timber and the world market.""
The Directorate for Timber of the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, headed by Danilo Anton Ranc, believes that the main goal of SiDG is to allocate part of the profits to help with wood processing. ""I don't see competition here, the goal was to direct part of the profit from state forests to those activities that are most in deficit. I see an opportunity in the field of wood composites, chipboard, maybe wood wool, where there are large investments and here SiDG can enter with some stake with a partner and start production. ""
'Two state institutions are walking in the woods'
Slovenian forests - private and state - are supervised by the Slovenian Forest Service, which provides a public forestry service. He is therefore a kind of forest supervisor who plans, directs and controls forest management. With 396 forest districts, it covers all Slovenian forests in the field. ""It represents an important service for forest owners, who are professionally advised and educated, and the most frequent contacts with forest owners are in the joint selection of trees for felling,"" they explain at the institute.
The key advantage of the current system is a unified approach within one company - SiDG, according to Marko Matjašič from GG Bled. All European countries have such a system with different variations, differing only in how much the state is involved in management or to what extent the company can manage according to market principles. ""The Slovenian system is very state-run and as such is very similar to Eastern European systems. Another difference is noticeable, namely that all other European companies that manage state forests also carry out implementation forestry planning in their forests, which ends with a waiver. ""Only in Slovenia is this work carried out by the Forest Service, which is professional and costly for the state, as two state institutions walk through the forests.""
Obviously, ZGS and SiDG also have different views on the roles of public and state institutions in the field of forestry. While SiDG CEO Robert Tomazin believes that in the future it will be necessary to amend the entire forestry legislation and ""look at how to redistribute roles and powers in the public forestry service"" performed by ZGS. On the other hand, v. d. ZGS director Janez Logar is convinced that the institution he leads will only gain in importance in the future. ""Because of all the changes, we will greatly shape the future and the quality of life of all Slovenes,"" he said.
Dejan Židan also draws attention to the role of ZGS as the bearer of the system of sustainable forest management, which means that the forest owner cannot cut down trees on his own and then plant new ones. ""But we know that many people would like to abolish this system in order to make more economic profit from the forest.""

As they point out, the way the agency's board of directors was replaced was inappropriate. Minister Simona Kustec rejects accusations that this is a political subordination of the agency.","According to a press release, the University of Ljubljana, the Universities of Ljubljana, Maribor and Nova Gorica are closely and with special care monitoring changes in the management of the Public Research Agency of the Republic of Slovenia (ARRS).
They take the clear view that it is essential to ensure the independent functioning of all institutions in the field of higher education and research, and that any political interference in their organization and work is unacceptable and also harmful.
They emphasized that the operation of higher education and research institutions (especially ARRS) as well as appointments to leading positions and bodies in these institutions must be based on professionalism and excellence, followed by properly implemented transparent procedures.
""We are facing significant challenges and important projects in the field of research, so it is crucial that ARRS performs its tasks smoothly, professionally and professionally, especially in terms of fulfilling its contractual obligations to conduct research and regular tenders, especially due to the current urgent preparation of executive acts related to the Law on Scientific Research and Innovation Activity, which was adopted by the National Assembly at the end of last year, ""they said.
They also emphasized that the method of changing the agency's board of directors was inappropriate and that politics should not interfere in the work of an independent agency in this way.
At its session on Thursday, January 27, the government again did not approve the appointment of Lidija Tičar Padar as acting director of the ARRS, as proposed by the agency's board, and replaced four of its representatives on the board. The board of directors in its new composition is on Saturday for the candidate in. d. confirmed the director of the agency, Mitja Lainščak, for whom the government issued a consent on the same day. Lainšček's term began today, and will last until the appointment of the director, but no later than July 30.
The government recently dismissed ARRS director Robert Repnik prematurely on 30 January. Namely, in early December, Repnik terminated his employment contract for the position of director due to health reasons.
The Minister rejects allegations of political subordination of the Research Agency
The Minister of Education, Simona Kustec, rejected accusations in the National Assembly that the appointment of Mitja Lainščak was d. Director of the Public Research Agency to subordinate the independent institution to politics. She emphasized his references and achievements in science.
The Minister of Education, Science and Sport emphasized that, from a legal point of view, they had followed all the legal provisions available to them as the responsible manager of the agency. If we want to be strong and recognizable in Slovenia, in her opinion we need a man at the head of the agency who is respected, who has references and is part of international networks, she said in response to a parliamentary question from Marko Koprivec from SD.
According to her, Lainščak's achievements in science and academic work in general are the result of numerous verifications, long-term work in acquiring competencies and advancement.
The Minister reminded that the director of the agency, Robert Repnik, had terminated his employment contract for the position of director due to health reasons. The agency’s board of directors was then asked to find a candidate who does not come within the agency’s structures. However, the voting did not follow the basic expectations of the founder and those who will ultimately be held responsible if the management of the agency is not taken in the right direction, she reminded.
Namely, the Management Board proposed Lidija Tičar Padar as the acting director of the agency, but the government rejected the proposal. After proposing that four representatives of the founder be replaced on the board of directors, the board of directors in its new composition on Saturday for the candidate for v. d. director confirmed Lainščak, and the government appointed him v. on the same day. d. director.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/slovenski-gozdovi-ustvarjanje-politicnih-fevdov-ali-talci-politicnih-menjav.html,In 5 years at the head of state forests as many as 5 directors,"That forests are our wealth is also true literally. State forests are worth around two billion euros, and the system of appointing directors of SiDG, which manages the capital, allows for political bargaining, where leaders come from the coalition's ruling parties at the time. The current CEO of the company, Robert Tomazin, is from the SDS. Is SiDG really a political feud to deplete or are the changes of five leaderships over the last five years politically motivated?","The fact that this was an unprofessional, political exchange is also criticized for the last exchange at the top of the Slovenian Forest Service, which directs the management of 20 billion euros worth of forests in Slovenia. He has been with the director without full powers for more than a year.
The last high-profile changes at the helm of both Slovenski državni gozdovi (SiDG) and the Slovenian Forest Service took place at a time when the ministry responsible for forestry was headed by Aleksandra Pivec. She proposed the replacement of the then director of the Forest Service, Damjan Oražm, in 2020. With the director of the Forest Service, the minister responsible for forestry proposes a candidate for appointment to the government.
SiDG also falls under the competence of the Ministry of Agriculture, but the same move that Pivčeva made with Oražem could not be made with the then director of SiDG, Zlatko Fick. Namely, the director of SiDG is appointed and dismissed by the company's supervisory board, half of whose members are nominated by the government. However, the supervisory board started with his dismissal, but Ficko left on his own after a year of dismissal. What the two exchanges had in common was that Pivčeva spoke publicly about the allegations.
But these were not the first changes in the central forestry institutions before the end of the term. These have been on the rise lately. The same names are circulating all the time in positions related to forestry.
SiDG: Five years, five managements - no director has finished his term yet
At the founding of the company in 2016, the first director of SiDG became the former director of Snežnik, Julijan Rupnik. According to media reports at the time, Rupnik was a member of the SD quota, which was led by Dejan Židan at the time and was also the political father of the SiDG as Minister of Agriculture. Today, Židan says that he has no information whether Rupnik was a member of the SD at the time. However, it is not a question of appointing a director from the quota, as he took over the management of the newly established company because he already ran the company Snežnik and it was logical that he would take the first steps in establishing the company. However, Rupnik lasted only two months as SiDG's first husband, resigning himself, allegedly due to political interference in the management of the company.
After Rupnik's resignation from the SiDG summit, Miha Marenče, the former secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, took over the management of the company, where he was responsible for forestry and co-drafted the law on state forest management. After Marenče left the ministry, Jože Podgoršek, today the Minister of Agriculture, stepped into his shoes. Today, Marenče is employed at the Forest Service as the head of the forest development planning department. Rupnik returned to the management of the Snežnik company, which the government transferred to the newly established SiDG as its in-kind contribution. But a good year later he also left the position of director in Snežnik.
He was fired by his successor as SiDG director, Ficko, who was appointed SiDG director in 2017. Supervisors, then led by former Lesnina CEO Pavel Brglez (DeSUS), chose from four shortlisted candidates. . Among those vying for the director's post was also the current general manager Robert Tomazin, who in the past also led Snežnik and is also the author of the first draft of the 2014 forestry strategy.
But Tomazin, who was still a member of the SLS, now the SDS, was not named, and during the government, with the coalition partners SMC, SD and DeSUS, Ficko was elected to the surprise of many. At the time, he was a member of DeSUS (before that he was also in the LDS and Zares). Although he was the director of forestry at SiDG for one year before his appointment as director general, his appointment immediately raised concerns that he had never been involved in forest production and that he did not have the required management experience in the tender.
He stayed at SiDG for three years, during which time he took care of a few raised eyebrows. Among other things, he was accused of buying company cars worth more than 200,000 euros, for which he did not obtain the necessary consent of the supervisory board, he planned to buy an office building, this investment tripled to six million euros.
During Fick's tenure at SiDG, allegations surfaced in the public about the huge amounts of timber allegedly being stolen from state forests. The then Minister Pivčeva publicly warned about this in the media, as even the SiDG supervisors warned her about it.
After a year of dismissal, when the Supervisory Board of SiDG was headed by Samo Mihelin, Ficko finally left SiDG alone, and with him also the financial director Darja Derganc. They left with a severance pay of six salaries.
Fick's departure after a change in the leadership of the DeSUS party
Ficko endured the transition from the government of Miro Cerar to the government of Marjan Šarc, as Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Karl Erjavec, Ficko's political ally, remained in both governments. Erjavec is said to have received the most credit for making Ficko the first man in the SiDG. Fick's departure came months after Erjavec left the top of the DeSUS party. At the time when DeSUS was led by Erjavec, Ficko was the head of the party's Ljubljana provincial committee. Erjavec also nominated him as the party's secretary general. Erjavec was succeeded by Pivčeva, who was the first to express her distrust of the Ljubljana Provincial Committee. Today, Ficko is in the SAB party, where he leads the party's local committee in Kočevje.
When Fick left, the SiDG supervisors ordered an inspection of the company's operations from the auditing company Ernst & Young, which, according to Tomazin, showed numerous irregularities. shortcomings in the company's operations, but did not require the prosecution of the former management.
At the time of Fick's removal, SiDG's supervisory board was headed by a former lawyer at the Ministry of Agriculture, Mihelin, who replaced Fick himself until the director was appointed on the basis of a tender. Mihelin allegedly wanted to keep one of the directorships, and he also had the support of Minister Podgoršek - then DeSUS, today NSi, but he did not succeed. Nevertheless, Mihelin remains connected with state forests, and today he is the head of the sector for legal systemic affairs and monitoring of state forest management at the ministry.
Current SiDG leadership from SDS, NSi and DeSUS
Namely, under the current government (SDS, SMC, NSi with the support of DeSUS deputies), the supervisors appointed Tomazin as the general director. The Management Board also includes Matjaž Juvančič, Business Director, and Andrej Janša, CFO, and before that he was a member of the company's Supervisory Board from the very beginning.
Tomazin is a member of the SDS, formerly the SLS, but has both professional and political experience. His last salary at the helm of SiDG was just over € 9,700 gross. He competed to lead SiDG when it was founded. From July 2000 to September 2005 he was the director of Snežnik. He found himself in the mainstream media at the time after strangers attacked him in front of his home. He linked the attack to the measures he took as director of Snežnik. The perpetrators were never found.
He was also in politics for some time. Between January and March 2013, he was Secretary General in the Cabinet of the Minister of Agriculture and the Environment Franc Bogovič (SLS). Tomazin was also a member of the SLS in the past, 18 years ago he ran for the position of SLS council president, in 2014 he was their candidate for parliament, and four years later he was on the SDS list.
During the current administration, SiDG bought, among other things, the building where they will have their main headquarters. It was bought from the Grča company, but it is a building that has been rented so far and is expected to be renovated by the end of the year. The purchase and renovation is expected to be three times lower than the cost of building an office building according to Fick's idea.
Not much is known about Juvančič (DeSUS). He is a member of the supervisory board in the Municipality of Litija, he was a member of the board of the Izola General Hospital, and he is currently a member of the supervisory board of the state housing fund.
More is known about Andrej Janša. Prior to becoming director, he was the supervisor of SiDG, and in October 2020 SSH appointed him to the supervisory board of Holding Slovenske elektrarne (HSE), and a month later as a temporary member of the HSE management responsible for electricity trading and sales.
Janša is not related to the current Prime Minister, but he is the son of the former President of the Management Board of Elektro Ljubljana, Vincenc Janša. In 2004 he was also employed by Elektro Ljubljana. He left the company when it was established that during his employment he sent offers for the sale and supply of electricity, under which he signed as the director of electricity marketing of the company Električni finančni tim. Deloitte's auditors later confirmed that Janša had breached his employment contract with Elektro Ljubljana.
Let's go back to the first director of SiDG. After he lost his job in Snežnik - as he says, Ficko took him away - he demanded tens of thousands of euros in compensation. In the end, they agreed, and in April last year, after five years, he returned to SiDG and became the head of the newly established service for quality and standards. Prior to that, he ran for the director position, where Tomazin was elected. In the meantime, he was in the cabinet of Minister Boštjan Poklukar, when he headed the Department of Internal Affairs, in 2018 he ran on the LMŠ list.
Podgoršek: I regret slandering SiDG in the past on the basis of rumors
In an interview for Facts, the current Minister Podgoršek assessed that the change of management of SiDG did not represent significant obstacles to the operation of the company, as the supervisors supervised the operation of the company well. ""I judge the company mainly by achievements, not by management. In a way, the change of leadership does not even bother me, because we trust the supervisors, who we also appoint,"" he said.
Whether the replacement of Fick was a politically motivated decision is difficult to comment on. However, he pointed out that any minister before him could order a forensic inspection of the company's operations in the event of information about irregularities in the operation of SiDG. He himself decided to do so soon after he became a minister. This would allow us to quickly, within a few months, obtain relevant information on the basis of which we could make the right decisions.
Thus, Podgoršek regrets that the forensic investigation was not ordered by his predecessors. ""I especially regret the slandering of SiDG through the media with the intention of slandering the management. This has a negative impact on the company itself, on its status,"" says Podgoršek.
The Minister is satisfied with the current management of SiDG, emphasizing the good performance of the company in the past year. “We are working very closely with this leadership,” he said.
A system of political setting or stopping bad practices?
When SiDG was established in 2016 during the government of Miro Cerar, it considered the decision to appoint half of the supervisors of the newly established state-owned company directly to the government, not to the Slovenian State Holding (SDH), which oversees supervisors in many state-owned companies.
Židan, who is considered the political father of state-owned forest management and was the then Minister of Agriculture, says today that he preferred either the appointment of a director directly from the Minister as he is known in Bavaria or the complete professionalisation of the system's appointment. which was wanted years ago by the then Prime Minister Borut Pahor. ""The worst thing is when everything is masked - on the one hand, everyone excuses themselves to make decisions elsewhere, and on the other hand, everyone wants to get involved in decision-making."" The State Forest Management Act, as it stands, is also a consequence of the then political forces in the National Assembly.
Židan sees the removal of Fick at the helm of the SiDG as a struggle on the shoulders of the SiDG within several currents of one political party (DeSUS). Meanwhile, the dismissal of Oražem, who was proposed by Židan at the head of the Forest Service, is assessed as another in a series of professionally completely unfounded dismissals.
And how much does politics influence the decision-making of the director of SiDG? The CEO of SiDG, which has run the company since February 2021, Robert Tomazin claims he does not have it. “I would say that current policy does not influence business decisions and we can make them unencumbered,” he told Facts. He finds the existing system of appointment appropriate, but ""the question of how well it is implemented in practice. Perhaps the concept of governing in Rome 2000 years ago was fine, but whether it is being abused is another story"".
Janez Logar, the current first man of the Forest Service, also says that he is not influenced by politics. He does not feel political influences and would not allow them to anyone. ""I am not politically responsible to anyone. I am not a member of any political party and I do not owe anything to anyone. If you take this position from the beginning and it is known, then there are no problems with these things,"" he said in an interview with Facts. In fact, Logar has applied for the position of director twice since running the institute, but was not selected. He intends to apply for the third time.
State Councilor Branko Tomažič is in favor of a system where the government has a significant influence on the appointment of the director of a state-owned company. “If we have political democracy, that political branch that comes to power has the right to change,” he says. Otherwise, he admits that such a way can, on the one hand, interrupt professional continuity in management positions, and on the other hand, it can interrupt bad work, because in the past ""some SiDG took as their own as a feud"" for exhaustion or. its after.
The Ministry of Agriculture believes that the system of appointing directors and supervisors is appropriate, so they see no reason for changes in this area.
At the Forest Service, the last two directors left early, the current one without a full term
In recent years, the Forest Service, which is the main forest planner for the whole of Slovenia, has also been quite turbulent. Janez Logar has been managing the institute as acting director for more than a year. In the meantime, two tenders for the director of the institute ended without a selected candidate. The government therefore extended the lodge to Logar until September. Before coming to a leading position in Ljubljana, he was the head of the Kranj regional unit at the Slovenian Forest Service, working at the institute for almost 28 years.
Logar took office after the government fired Oražem, who took over the management of the institute in December 2013. He did not complete his second term, which he should have finished this year, due to his early dismissal at the suggestion of Pivčeva. Oražem is still employed at the institute today as the head of the Postojna local unit.
Prior to that, Pivčeva drew public attention to some accusations against Oražem, including accusations of mobbing employees, abuse of office, illegal payments of increased volumes of work and overtime, and disputed employment. They were exposed e.g. also the report of the anti-corruption commission that Oražem employed a person living with him in a joint household, and the alleged disputed transactions between the institute and SiDG, where Oražem was the chairman of the expert council.
The former Minister of Agriculture is expected to propose to the government in 2018, after the expiration of Oražem's first term, that Gregor Danev, head of the Ljubljana regional unit of the Institute for Nature Protection, be given a new mandate to run the Forest Institute. However, under pressure from the coalition partners at the time, he had to withdraw his candidacy, and the government extended Oražem's term by four years.
We are still waiting for Pivčeva's explanations for specific questions regarding her role in the mentioned replacements.
Oražem's predecessor Ivo Trošt, who was appointed by the government in 2012 on the proposal of the then Minister Bogovič, also had to resign. In 2013, the government of Alenka Bratušek fired him at the suggestion of Bogovič's successor, Židan, after the institute ran out of money for field work due to reduced funds - foresters even ran out of petrol and red paint to mark trees suitable for felling. Trošt then initiated an administrative dispute, the case is now in the Constitutional Court. In the meantime, Trošt got a job at SiDG, where he is the head of the forestry sector.

She became vice-president of the Freedom Movement party, led by Robert Golob. Klakočar Zupančič became known to the public in last year's affair, when politics demanded that she be sanctioned because she criticized the Prime Minister on her closed Facebook profile. Due to political pressure, she left the judiciary in protest.","Urška Klakočar Zupančič spent her childhood in Sevnica, her birthplace, to which she is still very attached, she likes to return there, she has parents, relatives and friends there. He has fond memories of his hometown. She gained her knowledge at the Brežice High School and upgraded it abroad. ""I was among the first Soros scholarship holders and in my third year of high school I got the opportunity to go to school in England, to the prestigious Millfield private school. I lived there alone for a year and at a time when there was no internet and Ryanair.""
""In the fourth year I returned to Brežice, graduated with all possible points, went to study law in Ljubljana and as a graduate of the Faculty of Law I did an internship at the UN headquarters in New York. I upgraded my studies with a master's degree in legal history. ""I worked in the judiciary for 15 years, also as a senior legal adviser in the office of the President of the Supreme Court, at that time it was Franc Testen, whom I greatly appreciate and respect.""
Why from justice to politics?
""As you know, because of my critical words on Facebook, a real pogrom followed. I found myself in disciplinary proceedings, I was also deprived of the position of head of the condominium department at the Ljubljana District Court. Although I was not later found guilty, I left the judiciary ""I was disappointed that the judiciary succumbed to political pressure and did not want to be part of this system anymore. Namely, I would forever be branded as a judge who criticized the government,"" said the vice president of the new party on the political stage.
""I felt a duty to react to everything that is happening in our country. To contribute something to the necessary changes in our homeland. The topic that has spread to our country due to the actions of the authorities is already so dense that it is necessary to start cutting it. I am very touched by the injustices that happen to people. And I am touched by how the government treats people, what measures it takes, how it implements them through repression, how it communicates with citizens, This government is hostile to its own people, as if it doesn't like them, and this is reflected in everyday communication, all this cynicism and sarcasm that emanates from the ruling politicians. I'm not talking. I haven't experienced anything like this in 44 years. ""
'The government must work for the good of the people, and we are looking at everything before that'
A law graduate with a master’s degree in legal history knows general history and the history of law very well, she says. ""During my studies, I studied the impact of Nazi ideology on society and its subsystems and law. And if we analyze the situation in the country a little more in depth today, we can see that people are afraid of power. The epidemic is a great excuse to successfully control frightened people, and police, tear gas and water cannons are sent over 'disobedient' citizens. that it works for our health.Everything we’ve been watching here for the last two years reminds me of some other events from the 1930s.And I’m really afraid that if we don’t stop this, it could end badly for everyone ""We must not allow ourselves to wake up in another country any time soon. Then it will be too late.""
In democratic countries, the people have power, not the prime minister, not the parliament. We have these bodies or different branches of government so that the state can function. But power must work for the good of the people, for all citizens, exclusively for their benefit. before our eyes, democracy is turning into autocracy, running a country is becoming more and more like dictatorial countries, so it is high time that we citizens take matters into our own hands again and prevent it. he is intimidated and cannot show dissatisfaction with the current government, then the country is no longer democratic. ""

The state must take care of those who have a hard time getting through life
Our interlocutor says that she joined Robert Golob's team because she highly values ​​him as an expert and as a person. And because they share the same values. I can say that he is a very good man, intelligent, very capable, and he has humanity in him, which is extremely important in these times. He looks to the future and does not burden himself too much with the past. Hate can only be overcome with love, they are And both of us agree that one of our party's priorities will be the realization of the welfare state. It is necessary to reduce the growing gap between rich and poor. We do not want to live in a society where hundreds of thousands of people live below the threshold poverty, we must not allow people to sit in cold flats in jackets in the winter because they have no money for heating. We must not allow pensioners with miserable pensions not even to have food if they want to pay all the bills. ""
""It is essential that we find a solution for all people who live, instead of living with dignity. It is necessary to establish a social policy that will take care of all vulnerable groups of citizens who are struggling through life. Not to reduce taxes. We allow lower taxes on the luxury car and the rich on the income tax scale. Those who have more are less taxed. This is at odds with all logic and common sense. Whoever has more has to share more with others. the rich avoid paying taxes in Slovenia and transfer their property abroad for this purpose. ""
""The welfare state must take care of the sick who need treatment abroad, must take care of the purchase of urgently needed medical equipment, encourage the working population and help where necessary. If we live in a community, we must have a social sense and distribute the burden properly. Among the people. Even the energy crisis, which is currently threatening the lives of citizens and plunging them into huge heating costs, should be responded to by the state as soon as this problem arises. People are not to blame for the multiple price increases in the market. ""
'How could we get to the point where we are afraid of our own Police, which should protect us?'
This is what our interlocutor is asking herself, and many citizens are also pointing her out. ""We have reached a point where we are afraid of a security body that should be primarily concerned with our security, not persecuting us for expressing anti-government views. In an overheated political situation, the situation is so bizarre that citizens fear the police and its The government systematically subjugates repressive bodies, the police have become partisan police in the eyes of the people. arguments, when the profession doesn't matter anymore, only political affiliation matters. Are we aware of where we have come from? ""

""It is inadmissible for the government to persecute and insult journalists, abolish media freedom, replace people who shape media policy in the public media so that they can control media content. We have a ruling policy that does not respect court decisions, deals with judges, prosecutors and Discredits employees of the judiciary and other institutions, ordains science to political interests and spies for 'naughty' citizens. , so in front of everyone's eyes, they settle accounts with everyone who thinks differently. ""
Masleš affair: 'Disappointed over the judiciary'
Urška Klakočar Zupančič became a judge in 2008, she judged in civil cases, and for the last four years she was the head of the Condominium Department at the Ljubljana District Court. The department has been specializing in solving the problem of land registry and cadastral unregulated real estate since the times of social property. As already mentioned, she landed in disciplinary proceedings due to political pressures. Although she was not found guilty of any wrongdoing, she left the judiciary on her own last year. ""I was also disappointed with the Judicial Council, because the then president, in contrast to the other policy of the Judicial Council, publicly exposed me and branded me before any proceedings were initiated against me. This was followed by the intervention of former Justice Minister Lilijana Kozlovič. , who sent a letter to the three presidents of the courts and suggested that they take action against me. ""
""As in my case, in recent days I have been very disappointed with the conduct of the judiciary regarding the story with this unfortunate diploma of the recognized Supreme Court Judge and former Supreme Court President Branko Masleša. should protect the judge and take a firm stand on the matter, but not allow political portals to mutilate the exceptional supreme judge for two months and tarnish his reputation. And continue to do so. in case this body doubts his education, he could check all the documentation in his records and possibly ask the judge to submit the missing documents. Many times in our careers, we have to provide all the evidence of education when applying for various positions in the judiciary. u. ""
'Horse is the best natural antidepressant'
The former judge has been dealing with horses for 20 years. ""The horse is the best natural antidepressant for me, a magnificent animal with wonderful energy that has a beneficial effect on humans. So it is no wonder that horses are also used for therapeutic purposes. I can say for myself that I am a field rider, I enjoy being a horse in nature. Gina's mare is 15 years old and weighs 700 kilograms. ""
He also enjoys writing books. Last year, she published a historical fiction novel, Greta’s Sin, about a woman who knew too much and loved too much and was therefore accused of witchcraft. The story goes back to the 17th century, when a war between Protestants and Catholics raged in Europe. Our interlocutor has always been very interested in history.
""One last thought - I really want our country to return to the state we had years ago, when we lived in a completely different world, in different conditions and relationships. When we were not afraid of the authorities, when we felt I want this country back, that is, I want this country to be even better than it was then, to be truly legal, social, democratic, ecological and focused on sustainable development, to say: life in Slovenia it's really wonderful.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/gozdovi-neizkorisceno-bogastvo.html,Forests - a political feud?,"The battle for the two billion euro state forest is, according to personnel changes, at the forefront of every government. At the head of the company, which controls a fifth of all forests and was founded on the initiative of the then SD Minister of Agriculture Dejan Židan, they always put a man from the ruling set. Does a country that is at the top of Europe in terms of forest cover, behind Finland and Sweden, take advantage of this exceptional natural wealth? How does the place of wood, measured in dozens of trucks, go unnoticed? What does the extreme fragmentation of forests mean, we have as many as 413 thousand of them? The largest among private owners is the Roman Catholic Church. Why have we opened the door to foreigners, what is happening with the wood processing industry and how much is our wood really worth?","These are the questions we explored in this topic of the Facts column. We named it: Forests - Unused Wealth?
Why does the place of wood of dozens of trucks no one notices?
The team of investigative journalists - Neža Steiner, Anja Gorenc and Maruša Slana, delved into the field - the prey of all power and cunning thieves, traffickers, who see high earnings in the exceptional Slovenian wood. More than a thousand cubic meters of wood disappear from state forests every year. Particularly tempting - because of its value - is the mountain maple ribbed. It is rare, due to its special appearance it is used for making musical instruments, most often guitars, as well as for furniture veneer, for dashboards of expensive cars and yachts. Last year, a mountain maple trunk was stolen just before a public auction held by the state-owned company Slovenski državni gozdovi (SiDG) in December. The other half was sold at auction for almost 19,000 euros.
The ""smuggling"" across the Karavanke, and to Italy, such uncut wood, is not over. What do the police do, what does the inspection do, what do all the supervisory bodies do? They have leverage, are they on the ground? Has anyone been convicted at all?
Slovenian forests - a political feud?
That forests are our wealth is also true literally. State forests are worth around two billion euros, and the system of appointing directors of SiDG, which manages this capital, allows for political bargaining, where leaders come from - at the time - the ruling parties in the coalition. So far SD, DeSUS and SDS, of which the current CEO Robert Tomazin is a member.
Is SiDG really a political feud to deplete or are the changes of five leaderships over the last five years politically motivated?
Where does state wood end up - at home or abroad?
SiDG was also established to support and supply the domestic wood processing industry. Nearly 180 buyers who buy state-owned timber through long-term contracts have to process the timber at home. Does wood really end up at home or abroad? Meanwhile, domestic companies warn that they do not get enough wood and have to buy it in foreign markets.
The timber industry lost more than a third of its jobs in the first crisis, which began in 2008, and many factories closed. In the mid-1990s, larger Slovenian wood companies collapsed - Lipa, Meblo, Javor, Stol, Liko Vrhnika. What about today, who is at the forefront? Are these top domestic carpenters who also export abroad? Do we still have an industry? What?
The largest private owner is the Roman Catholic Church
The largest private owner is the Roman Catholic Church, especially the Archdiocese of Ljubljana. Church forests in the Bled forest management area cover almost 20,000 hectares. Most of the forests are privately owned, with very small forest owners, 413,000. Fragmentation, however, is a problem, so private owners should connect. Rok Sedminek, owner of just under 30 hectares of forest, called on the state: ""If the government allocates as much money as it did for SiDG, we are connected in one year, we can start working.""
In the next two weeks, you will be able to follow in-depth content from our forests on the 24ur.com website and in the Facts section, in the POP TV news programs - the Inspector section, the Checked show and the World on Channel A. Also about how everyone can use it, for a house, furniture, and the answer to the question - will spruce still grow in our forests in decades to come due to climate change, alas? Where are we when compared to our Austrian neighbors, where are we when we look at Finland?

When we invited him for an interview because of his rich experience, he expressed concern that ""police officers are no longer decision-makers, but only executors who no longer have the opportunity to think for themselves"" and that ""it all leads to police officers becoming soldiers "". Less than two months later: ""Well, I just got the epilogue to the interview. It took a long time and during that time I almost changed my mind that they are not so politically motivated. But I was wrong again,"" wrote Ščavničar and published - termination of the contract of voluntary service in the Auxiliary Police. It states, inter alia, that he is obliged to return to the Police the net amount of the standby payment received in the last 12 months before the termination of the contract.","Another move made by the current government, which evokes the feeling that criticism of the government and their representatives in Slovenia is sooner or later sanctioned in one way or another. Vlado Ščavničar is a retired police officer who, in his 35-year career, has specialized in protecting protests and various rallies.
As he himself says, he was a “general” in the Police; he was an assistant commander at the Ljubljana - Center Police Station, behind Bežigrad and Vič, and a commander in Grosuplje. Between 2002 and 2009, there was virtually no major event or rally where he was not present as head of field security. ""There were student rallies, rallies against US policy in the Middle East or in the Arab world - Kuwait, Iraq, Iran. There were protesting unions, homosexuals, the erased,"" he said. His rich experience was also the reason why we invited him to an interview to comment on the recent protests against the current government, which took place at the end of last year.
""Well, I just waited for the epilogue of the interview. It took a long time and during that time I almost changed my mind that they are not so politically motivated. But I was wrong again,"" wrote Ščavničar, and also published - termination of the voluntary contract. service in the Auxiliary Police.
In his resignation, the Director General of the Police, Anton Olaj, accused him of spreading ""untrue, unspoken and misleading information, both about the situation in the Police, which is supposed to lose its reputation, respect and professionalism, and about concrete police measures and procedures. apparently with the intention of harming the Police "".
""According to the contract, you are obliged, based on the request you receive, to return to the Police the net amount of the payment received for readiness in the last 12 months before the termination of the contract,"" it is written at the end of the notice.
That they were ""surprised"" that someone dared to think about them and their work at all, wrote Ščavničar in his response to the dismissal. ""If you step on a cat's tail, it squeals,"" the retired police officer is convinced. ""I didn't happen to have any intentions for the police and I didn't do any harm!"" he added.
In his words, ""some individual was probably afflicted by the blister I stepped on, but I certainly did not relinquish my duty and violate the law, as I am informed in the notice of termination of the contract.""
In an interview for our website published in early December last year, Ščavničar was critical of his work in the Police, saying that police officers are no longer decision-makers, but only executors. ""The organization of this service is hierarchical, there was always someone above you who could command you something, but within a certain framework. Now everything you have learned in your career - from schooling to field work, knowledge and experience - no it means nothing more. As an expert in a field, I no longer have the opportunity to think for myself and make decisions, ""he said.
According to him, ""it all leads to police officers becoming soldiers, but there is a significant difference between these two uniformed services. A soldier is a direct executor of an order, and a police officer must know things, legislation, tactics and methodology and work accordingly."" .
He is also convinced that the years and years when the Police successfully worked with people and built trust have gone to nothing. ""We are just a punishing body. The police will only gain a reputation when they make a cut at the system level and exclude the director general from the possibility of any replacements. And when it can be an expert, no matter what the daily policy. ""It does not have to be compatible with politics. Politics should be compatible with the values ​​of this society,"" said Ščavničar.
He now has to say goodbye to his job as a police officer - after 35 years of active career and three years of retirement. ""Well, they don't have that many eggs yet for someone to call me and ask anything,"" concluded Ščavničar, disappointed when the resignation was announced."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/zelenski.html,"Zelenski: The US is trying to dramatize the situation, panic is doing us a lot of damage","After persistent warnings in recent days and weeks, especially from Washington, of the danger of an ""almost imminent"" Russian invasion of Ukraine, President Vladimir Zelensky called on Americans to calm their rhetoric. ""The White House is trying to portray the threat of a Russian invasion as dramatically as possible. In my opinion, this is a mistake,"" he said, noting that ""unbalanced and unreasonable information policy"" has caused great economic damage to his country. This confirmed the reports of some media that there are some disagreements on the Washington-Kyiv line regarding the situation in this country.","In an interview with foreign media, Volodymyr Zelensky said that the withdrawal of employees from the embassies of Western countries in Ukraine was ""unnecessary and wrong."" he said it was necessary to be very careful in his statements and noted that some western analysts had already predicted the imminent war in November, and the threat was no greater than it was in April last year.
""If you look at satellite images, you can see an increase in the number of troops, but you can't say for sure that it's a threat, an impending attack, or a simple rotation of forces."" He said the increase in the number of Russian troops along the border was ""an attempt at psychological pressure"" with which Moscow wants to influence the outcome of the negotiations. He said there was no need to panic, as Ukraine had a strong enough army. ""Maybe they are thin on our streets? They are not,"" Zelensky warns, adding that the media creates a false impression of events in Ukraine. ""Unbalanced and unreasonable information policy has caused great economic damage to our country.""
He said that in the event of war, it would be a horrific and open conflict that would claim many casualties. He also criticized the announcement by Western countries that they would sanction Russia in the event of an attack. ""Why are they only talking about sanctions? Their purpose is to defend the European Union and NATO, not Ukraine,"" he said. The West has called for a declaration on Ukraine's membership in the North Atlantic Alliance, and until then, the Ukrainian president points out, the country is left to its own devices.
""I do not want the fate of Ukraine to be the result of agreements between Joe Biden and Vladimir Putin."" He expressed hope for tripartite talks, adding that Biden had assured him that the United States would not accept the agreements behind his back. ""It is important that Biden hears information about the situation in the country from me and not from intermediaries.""
In the conversation, he also revealed that the Russian president had invited him to talks in Sochi, and that he himself had proposed a meeting in Odessa. He asked Putin why he was proposing things he knew would not work. “This is the greatest possible cynicism,” he said. ""Why do you need so many soldiers there and why are you conducting exercises specifically in this territory, on the border. Is this sadomasochism? Why do you enjoy intimidating others?""
He also spoke about the domestic political situation and said that the biggest challenge for him was to keep the country together. He criticized the ""post-Soviet"" oligarchs of the old elite, who were not moved by the situation in the country, and added that Russia was facing the same problem.
Reuters: Russian army supplies blood and other medical equipment to border units
According to Reuters, citing three U.S. officials, the Russian military is said to have supplied supplies near the Ukrainian border with supplies of blood and other medical supplies, indicating that Russia is on combat readiness. They did not want to reveal when the Russian army was supposed to deliver the consignments to the units.
The Pentagon said some time ago that it had detected a supply of medical equipment, but according to a news agency citing unnamed experts, the revelation that it was blood supplies added ""an extra dimension to Russia's military readiness"".
""This does not guarantee that there will be an attack, but no army would certainly carry out an attack if it did not have these things at hand,"" said retired U.S. General Ben Hodges. However, the Russian Ministry of Defense has not (yet) responded to press inquiries. They also did not want to talk about it at the Pentagon."

They discussed with Foreign Minister Anže Logar the alleged agreement with Croatia on fishing in the Piran Bay and Prime Minister Janez Janša's announcement that a reciprocal opening of missions between Slovenia and Taiwan is promising, which has upset China. Before the closed session, SD MP Matjaž Nemec said that today they want to lay different foundations of foreign policy, with which Slovenia will create more opportunities for the economy and strengthen alliances. As they announced after the session, Slovenia and Taipei intend to open economic and cultural representations.","""Today we want to build a different foundation for foreign policy, so that it will open more opportunities for the economy and strengthen the alliance,"" said SD MP Matjaž Nemec in a press release before the closed session.
""First we quarreled with America, today we quarrel with China, tomorrow we will run for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council, and we urgently need the support of not only China but most countries,"" said the German. He accused Janez Janša of ""destroying international relations with his reckless statements"" and thus doing damage to the Slovenian economy. ""We want a different policy,"" the German stressed again.
Withdrawal from the arbitral award?
The opposition, which demanded the convening of the session, was mainly interested in whether the agreement with Croatia, if any, was to implement the arbitral award on the border or to withdraw from it. In the middle of the OZP session, State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gašper Dovžan has already stated that Slovenia respects and respects the arbitration award, which also results in obligations for both parties.
The Committee unanimously endorsed the decisions requiring the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue to work towards the implementation of the arbitration award. In this regard, the German stressed that the question remains whether a possible fisheries agreement would in any way affect the decision of the arbitral tribunal.
After the meeting, Minister Logar said only that the discussion was constructive. “I haven’t felt any major politicization, which is good because these are important topics,” he said.
Through silent diplomacy, Ljubljana and Zagreb are intensively searching for solutions to the current situation in the Piran Bay. However, it is not yet clear whether a possible intergovernmental agreement would mean moving away from the already defined border. Janez Stušek, the director of Sova, also took part in today's secret session. According to our information, he reported on the activities of the southern neighbors. Meanwhile, the Slovenian police emphasize that nothing has changed for them so far and that they do not have any new instructions. So they are still writing fines to Croatian boats that enter Slovenian waters illegally.
Slovenia and Taipei intend to open economic and cultural representations
The second item of the session was dedicated to the statements of Prime Minister Janša on the ""mutual opening of representations"" between Slovenia and Taiwan for Indian national television. The statements greatly upset Beijing and have already caused damage to some Slovenian companies cooperating with Chinese partners.
Proponents of convening the session pointed out that Janša's statements could have long-term consequences for relations with Asian countries and that they are inconsistent with Slovenia's long-term foreign policy strategy.
After the session, Foreign Minister Anže Logar informed the members of the parliamentary foreign policy committee about the intention of Slovenia and Taipei to open economic and cultural missions, said OZP president Monika Gregorčič and SD MP Matjaž Nemec. Regarding Croatia, the OZP called on the ministry to further implement the arbitration award.
According to the president of the OZP from the party Konkretno, the Minister informed the deputies of the intention to establish a Slovenian economic and cultural representation in Taipei and a reciprocal representation of Taipei in Slovenia. It was supposed to be named Taipei, she stressed.
The German said that a consensus had been reached on the appointment of a Taipei cultural and economic representative office in Slovenia, which would do so in Taipei, he said. At the same time, the deputies unanimously confirmed the conclusions that Slovenia remains committed to the policy of one China, Gregorčič explained.
The SD MP also emphasized that Slovenian politics remains committed to this principle. ""This message is unequivocal, it comes from all political actors and the competent committee of the National Assembly,"" he said. According to him, Prime Minister Janez Janša is isolated in this case in his moves and attitude towards China and Taipei itself.
On Janša's controversial statements
Former President Danilo Türk also spoke about the danger of Janša's statements. ""There is an impression that Slovenia is following the instructions of some political circles abroad, that someone is sending it to the embers for chestnuts."" Monika Gregorič said that it may have been just awkward statements or misinterpretation. ""Something can also be lost with translation.""
Minister Logar undertook to promptly and primarily inform the National Assembly of any agreements that may be reached in the future.
At the suggestion of the coalition, a majority of MPs (two are expected to abstain) noted that the government respects the one-China principle and suggested that it continue to pursue foreign political and economic interests in the Indo-Pacific region. Essentially, however, they reached a consensus on the name - it is a cultural and economic representative office of Taipei, which is comparable to that used by the neighboring Republic of Austria or Germany."

But with Golob, they certainly have the same goal, they believe in Kula, namely that this government leaves and that they form a new one after the elections. But there are also big differences between the parties of the current opposition, for example between the parties SAB and Levica, which was also shown at the recent session of the National Assembly.","
Robert Golob has a client and the closest team. ""I appreciate him as an intelligent person and a successful businessman, but of course politics is something completely different, we need to see how he will show and cut himself in this environment,"" said Maša Kociper from the SAB party. ""People will have a wide choice in these elections, I expect them to vote for parties that are not in line with the current government, so that we will return democracy to the country,"" Marjan Šarec predicts.
The search for common ground between the parties of the Coalition of the Constitutional Arc and Golob begins on Tuesday, when the presidents of Kula invite him to a meeting. ""However, the program has not yet been finalized, so we will wait for it to be elaborated,"" Dominika Švarc Pipan described the current situation of the SD party. ""Then we will be able to assess whether we are natural allies or allies, and whether any negotiating effort needs to be invested in this,"" said Matej Vatovec from the Left before the meeting. ""However, if we have talked to Golob and those who participate in the party, we have a lot in common, points of view and values,"" adds Švarc Pipanova.
Today is exactly two years since the fall of the government of Marjan Šarc, which followed the previous withdrawal of the Left from the supra-coalition agreement and then the laborious counting of votes of the minority government. With his resignation, Šarec was counting on the elections at the time, but this did not work out. ""I acted democratically, today, after two years, we see that it would be much better if we had elections then,"" says Šarec today.
Left and SAB in the proposal to change the method of paying sick leave on opposite banks
The Cool Coalition was formed later, but failed to replace the government. They now have a post-election agreement, so far four parties, but there are also deep differences in content. The debate over the SAB's proposal to change the method of paying sick leave between the SAB and the Left in the National Assembly on Wednesday sounded like a debate between the coalition and the opposition. "" opposition, ""criticized Miha Kordiš from the Left. ""You are allergic to everything that is economy and infrastructure, because from the beginning, for three years you only voted against what is an infrastructure project and economy,"" Marko Bandelli from the SAB party replied.
We would not place too much weight on these parties today. ""I don't think this is an alarm signal,"" Vatovec said. ""We in Kula have never kept it a secret that we are united by different parties, but we think that this diversity is something that will attract voters,"" Kociper concludes. The coalition had no comment on current political developments today."

The starting price for all three was $ 250,000 or $ 223,000. The items in the cryptocurrency 'Solana tokens' are to be sold below the asking price, due to a lack of interest and a drop in the cryptocurrency market.","
The three items up for auction were an iconic white hat worn by former U.S. First Lady Melania Trump, a watercolor of Trump wearing an iconic hat, and an NFT coin illustration with animation. The auction ended on Wednesday, CNN reports. Only five bids were recorded for the items.
Due to developments in the cryptocurrency market, products are sold below cost
Trump has set the cryptocurrency 'Solana Tokens' as the only currency of the auction. Although one of the potential buyers offered enough crypto tokens, the real value of the price due to the fall in the cryptocurrency market did not reach $ 250,000 or 223,000 euros. Due to the lack of interest in the items, the items are expected to be sold below the starting price of 170,000 dollars or about 150,000 euros.
There are currently about 17,000 digital currencies worth a total of a good $ 1 trillion ($ 1,340 billion) earlier this week. Before the last falls, they were worth more than $ 2,000 billion ($ 1,785 billion). The fall in the value of cryptocurrencies, according to experts, coincides with a rather gloomy mood in the financial markets. One of the reasons for this is the growing geopolitical tensions, especially the fear of an outbreak of armed conflict in Ukraine. In addition, monetary policy in the United States is expected to tighten earlier than expected in the fight against inflation.
The cryptocurrency market has also been hit by a critical stance by Russia's central bank, which last week proposed a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies. Russia is considered one of the centers of cryptocurrency mining, which takes place through complex calculations on computer systems, reports STA."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/opozicija-kriticna-do-spremembe-zunanjepoliticne-strategije-slovenije.html,The opposition is critical of the change in Slovenia's foreign policy strategy,The Foreign Policy Committee of the National Assembly (OZP) was acquainted with the updated strategy of Slovenian foreign policy. State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Gašper Dovžan said at the presentation that the strategy was the most changed in the description of the international environment. Members of the OZP from the opposition were not in favor of the changes.,"In a short presentation of the renewed strategy, State Secretary Gašper Dovžan said that in addition to changes in the description of the international environment, additional attention was paid to ""non-state stakeholders, efforts for a free and open Internet, cyber security and hybrid threats, international trade agreements, climate change and green and digital switchover "". He also emphasized the emphasis on the role of the European Union as the central, political, economic, legal and value environment for the Slovenian state.
According to him, the document also takes into account the situation after Brexit, defines further commitment to the EU enlargement policy and defines the guidelines for cooperation with Russia in a changed situation. He added that the renewed foreign policy strategy would be a useful guide for the work of the Foreign Ministry and Slovenian diplomacy, as well as other ministries and deputies. ""It makes sense for this document to receive support and that it will serve the needs of all of us to its advantage,"" Dovžan added.
The State Secretary also said that this was not a new document and that the declaration on Slovenia's foreign policy from 2015 was still in force. According to him, the foreign policy concept remains the same and appropriate, but due to changes in the international environment, ""certain slightly different emphases"" were needed, which are included in the renewed foreign policy strategy.
At the OZP session, the State Secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced the opening of the Slovenian embassies in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia and the reopening of those embassies that were closed due to financial reasons, but did not provide other details. He also announced a visit by the foreign minister to India, but did not specify an exact date.
During a short discussion on Slovenia's changed foreign policy strategy, members of the OZP from the opposition were critical of some of the planned changes, in particular the fact that the text no longer defines Slovenia as part of a core EU. They also pointed out the lack of a broader discussion on the key goals of Slovenian foreign policy.
Branislav Rajić (SAB) emphasized the importance of defining Slovenia's place in the core of the EU and the principle of the rule of law. He said that the SAB party does not support the renewed strategy in its current form, but is ready to contribute suggestions.
Nik Prebil from LMŠ also pointed out the issue of the rule of law and believed that Slovenia should act more thoughtfully in the international arena and have a goal-oriented foreign policy with the help of strengthened economic, cultural and scientific diplomacy. His party colleague Lidija Divjak Mirnik also said that ""it is not good for Slovenia to move away from the core EU countries"".
Matjaž Nemec (SD) pointed out that the updated strategy was a ""supplement"" to the declaration on Slovenia's foreign policy, which was adopted by a two-thirds majority in 2015, but opposition parties were not involved in the reform of the foreign policy strategy. He said the renewed strategy was too long and too ambitious and had ""too much ideology with a touch of the (ruling) SDS party"".
Only Jožef Horvat (NSi) spoke on behalf of the ruling coalition, saying that the government had thoroughly informed the deputies about the renewed strategy and that it was a government document adopted by the government. foreign policy issues. He welcomed the changes in the strategy and assessed that the renewed strategy remains within the basic value, political and security framework, which is Slovenia's membership in the EU and NATO.
According to him, it is also conceivable that the government adopted changes to the strategic document on foreign policy at the end of Slovenia's presidency of the EU Council, which expired last year. At the same time, he called for the OZP or the National Assembly to conduct a thorough analysis of what Slovenia ""did well during the EU presidency"" before the end of its term.
After discussing the renewed strategy, the committee abandoned the discussion of other items on the agenda due to the start of the extraordinary plenary session of the National Assembly. The OZP session is expected to resume tonight or Thursday.
The German MP later said in a press statement that the changed strategy did not adequately address the challenges of the future and that it was an ideological document which, in his opinion, did not reflect changes in the international arena but reflected changes in the domestic political space.
The government introduces into this document ""the ideology of comparisons between communism and Nazism"" and ""creates a rift in various respects"", which is unchanging for such a document. According to Nemec, the renewed strategy ""clearly expresses the ambition of the ruling party (SDS) to reflect their ideology and their view of the world in Slovenian documents, which in my opinion is unacceptable.""
Mr Prebil was of a similar opinion, pointing to the commitment of EU members that EU law is above national law. He added that foreign policy should be a matter of dialogue, conversation, respect and key core values. He expressed fears that ""the government will now use this to approach and provide services to countries that deviate from these values"".
OZP President Monika Gregorič (Specifically), a member of the Strategic Council for the Renewal of Foreign Policy Strategy, later pointed out in a statement to the media that it was a government document and thanked the government for deciding to present the document to the OZP. According to her, the updated document, especially in terms of the external circumstances of the international community, is ""very high quality"" and ""responds to all current challenges and developments in the international community""."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/milanovic-napovedal-umik-hrvaskih-vojakov-z-natovih-odzivnih-sil.html,Milanovic announced the withdrawal of Croatian troops from the NATO Response Force and upset Kyiv,"Croatian President and Commander-in-Chief of the Croatian Army Zoran Milanovic added some unrest to the already tense relations on the international political stage when he said on Tuesday that if the situation in Ukraine escalated, he would withdraw Croatian troops from the NATO Response Force (NRF). . According to him, ""Croatia does not want to have anything to do with this"" because the military alliance is constantly increasing its presence in Eastern Europe due to escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine.","Croatian President Zoran Milanovic filled the headlines on Tuesday when he told reporters in Zagreb how Croatia would respond to the escalating situation in Ukraine: ""I read reports that NATO is increasing its presence and sending some reconnaissance ships. we have nothing and we don't want to have anything. I guarantee that. Not only will we not send our troops; if tensions escalate, we will withdraw our troops - to the last Croatian soldier. ""
As today's Politico writes, he caused a lot of confusion with these statements. Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Grlić Radman claimed to a German journalist yesterday that ""the president does not speak on behalf of Croatia, but for himself"". ""We are and will remain a loyal member of NATO. Everything we do is done in consultation with partners,"" he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. He added: ""In such times, it is especially important to show solidarity between partners, and Croatia will do so in the EU and NATO.""
However, Politico reports that Milanovic's words are not innocent. It soon turned out that the Croatian forces in Poland, which is 80 soldiers, had already returned home. According to the Croatian newspaper Jutarnji list, the state does not intend to send a new unit to Poland this year, so there will be no Croatian forces that could be withdrawn.
Milanovic also said that ""the hysteria we are witnessing in Eastern Europe is happening in the foyer of the Russian capital."" Sam sees a different way of rescuing Ukraine, by helping Kiev economically.
The overthrow of Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych in 2014 was, in his view, a ""coup d'etat backed by the European Union and Washington"". ""The movement that toppled Yanukovych was anything but democratic,"" he said.
He also mentioned that Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in the world. He is convinced that the West must find a solution that takes into account Russia's security interests.
Milanovic upset Kyiv with these statements. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry has already summoned the Croatian ambassador to Kiev, Anica Dzamic, to inform her that the president's statements are unacceptable. They expressed deep disappointment in the conversation.
""The Croatian president has shown contempt and ingratitude for the help Ukraine and Ukrainians have given Croatia in its struggle for independence and also in the fight against last year's fires,"" the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. They demanded the public revocation of these statements, adding that they should not be repeated in the future.
Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković had previously apologized to the Ukrainians for the president's statements and said he did not know which soldiers Milanović was talking about. ""Croatia's policy is to defuse tensions, prevent conflicts and support Ukraine's integrity,"" he said."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/preiskovalna-komisija_3.html,Pavšič: Janša is objectively and subjectively responsible for all defeats in the epidemic,"Former Health Minister Tomaž Gantar and Klemen Nicoletti were asked questions before the Commission of Inquiry, which is establishing political responsibility for government measures during the epidemic. The latter did not want to answer them. The chairman of the commission of inquiry, Robert Pavšič, said that recent hearings had shown that the commission's findings required consideration of several suspicions of committing criminal offenses.","
The chairman of the Commission of Inquiry, Robert Pavšič, said that one of the commission's priorities was also the analysis of decision-making processes during the time covered by the commission of inquiry. ""Politics referred to the profession, and the profession said several times at the hearings that it had not been heard. Tomaž Gantar also said that the profession was an extended government term several times. All this resulted in poorer effectiveness of measures.""
""We also learned that the Prime Minister personally decided to introduce rapid testing, although the profession was very opposed. He also personally directed the creation of a vaccination strategy. In doing so, he took objective and subjective responsibility for all defeats suffered by the government experienced in the field of epidemic management, ""he said, adding that such findings call for consideration of several suspected criminal offenses.
Pavšič said that according to polls by the Ministry of Health, as many as 82 percent of people opposed government measures. ""They didn't share it with the public, but kept it to themselves.""
As for Nicoletti, however, he said his testimony would be essential for disclosure. ""Something was definitely going on in the background, which was not right and points to several possible serious consequences. We offered him a chance and he turned it down. He was quietly on reserve, not for specific reasons. So any witness could do the same ""This is a degradation of the commission. I proposed sanctions, the commission confirmed it. We will send the case to the court for execution,"" he said in response to a journalist's question.
Recall, Nicoletti did not want to answer questions because he could harm himself in the pre-trial proceedings, said his lawyer Dejan Markovic. He expects criminal proceedings to be instituted against Nicoletti. Police conducted house searches at Nicoletti and Majbert Pharm in December last year on suspicion of abuse of office. Nicoletti has not yet received the documentation that is supposed to burden him, and the police have not yet had an informative interview with him.
The Gantar-led Ministry of Health purchased a number of rapid tests from Nicoletti's company, and the verification was carried out by the National Laboratory for Health, Environment and Food (NLZOH). The fired virologist Metka Paragi then revealed to the public that the rapid tests were inadequate, but the NLZOH nevertheless recommended them to the government.
Gantar said at the hearing that the government could have done better in dealing with the first and second waves of the epidemic.
The Prime Minister Janez Janša has already testified before the commission. Regarding the purchase of rapid tests of the company, Majbert Pharm pointed the finger at the Ministry of Health, although he himself headed the ministry during the period between the ministries of Gantar and Poklukar."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/el-salvador-uvaja-bitcoin-kot-placilno-sredstvo.html,'The introduction of bitcoin in El Salvador is a bet that is very likely to work out well',"Nayib Bukele, the Salvadoran president with the accompanying characteristics of a Central American dictator, is navigating an impoverished country through a pandemic crisis and hazard by introducing bitcoin as a means of payment. The millennial millionaire says he is working to bring capital and wealthy people to a financially unstable country. Investment experts estimate that gambling pays off, as bitcoin has good long-term prospects. On the other hand, the lower classes do not share the optimism of financial experts.","On September 7, 2021, bitcoin in El Salvador became legal tender. With this, this Central American country became a pioneer in this field. Politicians are convinced that the decision was necessary for economic growth. A law passed by the ruling party stipulates that any trader who has the appropriate technical equipment at his disposal must accept bitcoin for a fee. The people of the country will also be able to pay taxes with bitcoin. The exchange rate from bitcoin to the US dollar, which has been the country's official currency since 2001, will be free to determine the market.
Payments with cryptocurrency are made by residents through the Chivo digital wallet, which has already caused some initial problems. Authorities have detected several cases of wallet counterfeiting and other technical problems. According to the latest figures from President Nayib Bukelei, the wallet is used by more than half a million people.
However, as many as 70 percent of the population opposes the introduction of bitcoin and other cryptocurrency plans. The proportion of people who do not have access to traditional financial services and are dependent on remittances from relatives living in the United States is similar. These represent as much as 23 percent of GDP or six billion dollars (5.32 million euros). The government hopes that this will avoid high bank fees when sending money from abroad.
The seed of opposition to the introduction of the new means of payment is also the memory of the population of 2001, when the ""dollarization"" of the state also dealt a severe blow to the less affluent, increased disparities and sparked widespread discontent. An important fact in the low popularity of the government's bitcoin strategy is the general ignorance of the concept of cryptocurrencies, as only under five percent of the population is familiar with basic knowledge.
Critics say the ""bitcoinization"" is a ill-considered attempt to tackle the country's deep-seated structural problems, which have plunged into one of the biggest economic crises in decades in a pandemic. Bukele, who is pushing for more capital inflows and rejecting demands for progressive taxation, is also facing debt in excess of 90 percent of GDP and dissatisfaction with the World Monetary Fund (IMF). The latter on Tuesday called on the state to stop using bitcoin as a payment currency. They noted that the adoption of cryptocurrency as a legal tender ""poses significant risks to financial and market integrity, financial stability and consumer protection"".
On the other hand, in the long run, the president's decision could pay off, says investment expert and author Robert Rolih, who sees the country as ""a rebel going in its own direction, which is very likely to be successful.""
According to him, the decision to introduce bitcoin as a means of payment is a bit premature, while the use of bitcoin as a state cash reserve is a decision that has the potential to succeed. ""Bitcoin is basically not meant to be a classic currency. Due to fluctuations in value, it is very difficult to use it for this purpose. We need stability for the currency. Let's say, regardless of the fact that we have inflation, we still know what one euro can be. ""But with bitcoin, it's growing and falling very fast,"" he explains.
Rolih sees investing in state reserves as a move that will benefit the state in the long run. ""It's very difficult to see a scenario where bitcoin won't work in the long run. We've seen gold stagnate over the last ten years and lose that luster. It's very difficult to see some scenarios where bitcoin would be in the long run, say five to ten years. had poorer returns than gold. ""
Bukele also some time ago revealed plans to establish t. i. Bitcoin City, a city where investors from all over the world would not pay taxes. Some warn that such an idea would bring even more criminal organizations to the country, which would turn El Slavador into a real money launderer. Rolih, who warns that this project may never materialize, sees the idea as a positive part of the story. ""It's a move that could attract investment and wealthy people to the country.""
El Salvador is facing major problems due to a weak economy and large debts, making it a rather risky country for investors. ""Such moves always pose a risk,"" says Rolih, ""but by issuing a bitcoin bond, everything could end well, if, of course, bitcoin goes well."" ""In their place, I would also take this risk. I estimate that there is a 95% chance that they will succeed. However, if bitcoin does not achieve the projected growth, they will not succeed in the experiment. However, given that It's an already risky country, I don't think that in case of failure it would worsen the situation in the country. It's a bet that is very likely to work out. ""
After the end of the pandemic, bitcoin pioneering would otherwise boost tourism, which is likely to attract many influential people and ""digital businessmen"" to the seashores.
Bukeley's law also poses a great ecological danger, environmentalists warn. In 2017, after a decade-long battle that cost environmental activists several lives, El Salvador became the first and only country in the world to ban metal mining. Now the president has offered to focus the country’s limited geothermal resources on bitcoin mining, which could quickly force El Salvador to resort to importing carbon-based energy to meet its domestic needs.
But Bukele has an ace up his sleeve, says our interlocutor. And that is volcanic energy. El Salvador will issue Bitcoin bonds or. Volcanic bonds. They are expected to be issued for $ 1 billion at an annual interest rate of 6.5 percent. Investors are also expected to receive part of the returns that Bitcoin will achieve during this period. ""If they manage to extract volcanic energy at low cost and use it to mine bitcoin, they could solve this problem. and it is a cheap source of renewable energy. It is very difficult at the moment to assess whether the cost of this energy will be low enough to make it profitable. ""
For Salvadoran working-class families who are dependent on wage labor and will receive only crumbs of state cryptocurrency business, the perspective is quite different. Therefore, the unions emphasize that “bitcoinization” is not a tool for emancipating the Salvadoran economy from dependence on foreign countries, but only offers new forms of subordination and external vulnerability.
The country has therefore been rocked by numerous demonstrations as well as arrests of some critics of the introduction of bitcoin and related infrastructure. Bukele also managed to purge the judiciary and suspend some judges through the pro-constitutional Constitutional Court. The protests were attended by unions, war veterans, left and right opposition, and some other civil society organizations. The protests were also accompanied by riots."

He is a judge for 42 years, of which he has been employed at the Supreme Court for 22 years, now as the head of the criminal department. He is currently the oldest judge, but he will retire in the fall. He was also President of the Supreme Court for six years. In December last year, a story was launched on web portals controlled by the ruling politics that the Supreme Court Judge and former President of the Supreme Court Branko Masleša did not have the appropriate education, diploma and bar exam.","The Judicial Council has now called on him to clarify doubts about the validity of his education certificates. ""I am sad that the Judicial Council has succumbed to the incitement in some media, which for almost two months untrue represent the circumstances that concern my education. I cannot get rid of the feeling that all false allegations are exclusively politically motivated. So far, he has not given me the opportunity to comment on all this. No one has asked me anything, ""said Branko Masleša in a special interview for our website and showed us all the certificates of his education, including a diploma from the Faculty of Law in Sarajevo.
""I am disappointed that the Judicial Council did not ask me anything for two months about my education, did not ask me for any explanations or documents, and now they have taken the position that even if they are not competent to assess the authenticity and authenticity of documents about my education. , let me clarify the ambiguities and doubts about the validity of graduation certificates and the bar exam, as otherwise the reputation of the judge and the judiciary will be tarnished. I am outraged. and I can say that the members of the Judicial Council are the ones who have contributed to the damage to my judicial reputation and the judiciary as a whole, ""said Chief Justice Branko Masleša.
Why didn't he respond to the accusations for two months? 'I was honored by all these lies'
The former president of the Supreme Court, now the head of the criminal department, says that the lies about his education have intensified. ""It started with the claim that I was not among the graduates of the Faculty of Law in Sarajevo, later my diploma disappeared in a fire. He doubts the statements of the Sarajevo Faculty, which confirmed that I finished my studies there. There is no dry stamp on the submitted copy of the diploma. Because I do not have a bar exam at all and I was also admitted to the internship time when I was on military service. ""
""They continued to do the pomegresses that the documentation relating to my judicial exam also ended up in fiery teeth, and they achieved the excess with the allegations that my judicial exam in Slovenia is not in force. In short, you have a hard time fighting against such lies, which are escalating. The imagination of the authors of these articles has no limits, ""Masleša said indignantly.
Lawyer number 3227
The chief judge says things have gone so far that even the Sarajevo Cantonal Inspectorate has dealt with his education. The latter stated that it was indisputable that he had obtained a diploma from that faculty and the professional title of law graduate in accordance with the regulations in force at the time. ""By inspecting the original of my index, the inspector found that all passed exams were entered in it, a total of 28, and signed by the professors responsible. All original applications for passed exams were submitted to the inspector, as well as original enrollment, application and semester ""Looking at the book of graduates of the Faculty of Law in Sarajevo, starting with the number 1901, all the way to 3435, the competent inspector found that I was registered as a law graduate under ordinal number 3227 and took over the original diploma,"" explains Masleša.
Regarding the bar exam: ""From the evidence I keep carefully, it is clear that I did an internship at the District Public Prosecutor's Office in Sarajevo as a full-time volunteer trainee from April to August 1975, and then as a full-time trainee until July 1976. The Republic Secretariat for Justice and Organization of Administration granted me access to the bar exam in May of the same year. June 25, 1976. Thus, the claim that I was recognized as an intern for the period of my military service is not true, as I was in the army from the end of July 1976 to the first of July next year. ""
Disappointed with the Judicial Council: 'They are violating our reputation and the reputation of the judiciary'
He makes no secret of the fact that he is extremely disappointed with the proceedings of the Judicial Council over the affair over his education. ""I would expect and respect for me that the Judicial Council would turn to me during these two months and ask me about my education, evidence and everything that was written. I did not get a single question, no one demanded my explanations, on and finally, they write that, in order to protect and build confidence in the judiciary, the authorities expect me to clarify ambiguities and doubts about the validity of my diplomas and bar exams. ""
""At the same time, they inform that the Judicial Council is not competent to verify the fulfillment of the formal conditions of candidates for judicial office when the proceedings are final. And that they are not competent to verify the authenticity of documents submitted during the candidacy for judicial office. It was enough for me that the Supreme Court provided the public with photocopies of diplomas and certificates of passing the bar exam, but this was clearly not enough. should they come to see the diploma? It's below every level of the position I hold. ""

Branko Masleša graduated in 1975 in Sarajevo, got a job at the Koper court five years later, and in 1994 he was elected to a permanent term. The judge is 42 years old, 22 years working in the Supreme Court. He was president for six years.
What is left of the 'Masleš does not meet the conditions for a judge' affair?
For 21 years I have been exposed to various lies about my life, incitements and absurd accusations. If I have ever been entertained, it seems to me that today a myth about you arises, which you can easily get rid of. It is difficult to shake off. also all this mud that your opponents or political portals are covering you with, because there is always some mud left on you, you can never wash it completely, and it's hard to fight countless lies, especially because you can't go on a level of indecent communication. And it's hard to win. There's a flood of misinformation in the public, people don't even distinguish real, credible information from fake news. The line is increasingly blurred. A lot of misinformation is being spread on purpose. ""
""We were able to read headlines on politically profiled portals that Sarajevo was unsuccessfully searching for my bar exam, and that I was a time bomb for the judiciary, discussing how all my judgments would be challenged because I was illegally appointed. Even lawyers announced in articles, that this will be an outrageous legal scandal, etc. Even a judge should not be. As I have already said, a real pogrom against me is completely baseless, built on lies. an affair of unimaginable proportions and inciting false news. ""
Attacks on the judiciary
Politician attacks on the judiciary have been on the rise in the last two years - discrediting judges, attacking court decisions and insulting individuals. Our interlocutor says that this is an undermining of the judiciary, as this system cannot be destabilized other than by discrediting individuals. Judges have a permanent mandate and are therefore protected from political interference. However, it is true that discredits also bring unrest to the judiciary, and that is the goal, says Masleša. ""The point of discrediting is that they devalue you as a person and thus your decisions that you make at work. The judiciary, by its nature, cannot and must not engage in inappropriate communication with other branches of government, as it must constantly to protect its appearance of impartiality. It is the Judicial Council that should intervene in such cases, ensure dialogue and a reasonable settlement of disputes. If this is not the case, we have a problem. ""
""According to legal theorist and former Israeli Supreme Court President Arahon Barak, tensions between politics and the judiciary are leading to deteriorating relations, unbridled criticism of the judiciary, followed by attacks on the legitimacy of judicial decisions, influencing appointments and promotions, and finally calls for prosecution. judges as a result of judicial decisions taken. ""
Masleša withdrew from all proceedings against the Prime Minister
It is no secret that Prime Minister Janez Janša is not in favor of the former President of the Supreme Court, as he does not hide it in the least. The story has a long beard, dating back to the time of the election of Branko Masleša as Supreme Judge, and reached its peak during the trial in the Patria case and the protests that took place before the court. ""At that time, the protesters called me to resign, pasted my pictures around Ljubljana, gave speeches in front of the court and gave the impression that they had conquered the court when they took up space all the way to the main entrance. It was a very unpleasant experience. halls and not the streets. And this distrust of the people towards the judiciary also stems from the uncontrolled attacks that politicians indulge in. ""
However, Judge Masleša is excluded from all cases concerning the Prime Minister. ""Janez Janša is also suing me over the Patria case. Me and three other judges and the prosecutor. ""This is an absurd lawsuit, which is part of the arsenal of prosecution of judges due to the content of the court decision. We have not had a hearing yet, but we expect it to be announced this year.""
Masleša, the head of the criminal department, is the oldest judge at the Supreme Court. He has been driving to work from Koper every day for 22 years.
We ask our interlocutor whether he will also decide on lawsuits due to publications that he does not have the appropriate education, diploma and bar exam? He says he will deal with this thought when he retires, that is, in the fall. And that he will not file lawsuits until then.
Disputes are also in the Supreme Court
It is no secret that there is also friction between judges in the Supreme Court. We have been able to read several times about disagreements between individuals. Masleša does not want to comment on this, because he does not want to get into new disputes and open new fronts. However, he points out that he sees a serious problem in the fact that recently it is happening that separate opinions, which are supposed to go public in accordance with the Rules of Procedure at the same time as the Supreme Court decision, overtake on the right and are published before the verdict is announced. ""This has now happened in two high-profile cases, in the Balkan Warrior case and even earlier in the misdemeanor case of wearing protective masks. This is in stark contrast to fair communication and the rules of procedure. But now this is happening and sheds a bad light on the work of the Supreme Court and further encourages attacks on court decisions. ""
Response of the Association of Slovenian Judges
""In the Slovenian Judges' Association we could not find out on what basis the suspicions regarding the diploma or bar exam of Supreme Judge Branko Masleša arose, so we assessed this as a mere pobalin provocation aimed at discrediting not only a particular judge but the judiciary in general. According to the law, the Judicial Council is the only competent body that, when appointing a judge to a certain judicial position, checks whether the candidate for this position meets, among other things, all formal conditions. We hope that the Slovenian Judges' Association will not continue its attempts to erode trust in the institutions of the rule of law, ""wrote dr. Vesna Bergant Rakočević, President of the Slovenian Judges' Association."

In addition to the new leadership, the party's congress also changed the party's statute. In addition to Golob, his immediate team is now known.","Golob, who appeared in public for the first time as president of the Freedom Movement party, said they deliberately chose the term ""movement"" for the name, as they want to show that they are not an ""ordinary or classic party"". He also introduced the core team. Namely, the members also elected a new vice-president, this role was taken over by Urška Klakočar Zupančič. Matej Arčon has been appointed general secretary, and Mirta Koželj has been nominated for president of the party council. The members of the party council will decide on her appointment at Thursday morning's session of the party council.
""This is the framework of the team. Today we have established a platform to which we invite everyone to join us,"" Golob said, adding that he believes the team will grow in the coming weeks as new people join them every day. . He announced that they will have an election convention and congress in March, and thus a list of candidates for the election.
“The programmatic starting points remain similar, but stronger,” he was striking. Above all, he highlighted the climate agenda, as it is immensely close to his heart. ""I believe that the climate agenda is the most crucial for the future of Slovenia and especially our children. That is why it remains in the first place,"" he said.
""But we certainly cannot escape taking the human crisis with covid and health in general very seriously and addressing all the challenges of intergenerational dialogue. Both young and old,"" he said, explaining that Congress had confirmed these three main programs. starting point. “And around these three, we plan to maintain our supporters and sympathizers,” he said.
""I can proudly say that, in addition to the climate agenda, we will strive for respect, freedom, democracy and the restoration of the rule of law,"" said Vice President Klakočar Zupančič, adding that they would strive for an inclusive society with clear boundaries of what is allowed. and what not.
The congress, which started with a delay of about half an hour, was held behind closed doors, with only about ten people physically attending, as it is otherwise held digitally. The congress is of a more formal nature, as another one will soon be organized to define the party's program and candidate list in more detail.
In recent weeks, Golob also met with KUL party presidents, who invited him on Monday to join them in a regular weekly meeting next week. LIDE under the leadership of Igor Zorčič and DeSUS are also counting on a possible connection with Golob, as they are already agreeing on a joint list of candidates for the parliamentary elections.
Janša about Golob: In my opinion, this is more about Janković's make-up exam
On the sidelines of the government's visit to Posavje, Prime Minister and President of the largest government party SDS Janez Janša also commented on Golob's entry into politics. Among other things, he assessed that it was ""more of a corrective exam for Zoran Janković"". Otherwise, ""voters will tell everything,"" he added.
""We will be ready to work for the common good with anyone who gains the trust of voters and is a parliamentary party in the next convocation of the National Assembly,"" the Prime Minister's Office said in a statement.
""As far as the concrete candidate is concerned, in my opinion it is more about Zoran Janković's make-up exam. chessboard, ""the prime minister outlined. He added: ""It seems that the one who manages the chessboard gave instructions."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/eseji-zunanji-sovrazniki-zapletena-zgodovina-kako-smo-koncali-na-pragu-vojne.html,"Essay, external enemies, complicated history: how did we end up on the brink of war?","Although for now all those involved still swear in principle to seek diplomatic solutions, tensions on the Russian-Ukrainian border do not seem to be over. Russian President Vladimir Putin says he will find his own ""military technical"" solution if NATO does not stop its ""aggression"", and the West accuses him of looking for conflicts where there are none and predicts ""painful sanctions"". Ukraine is between the two great powers. A country tired of political replays, crippled by domestic corruption, a weak economy and the search for a (new) identity between East and West.","While Putin is demanding extensive security guarantees, including NATO's exclusion from any future enlargement in Ukraine or other countries along Russia's borders, NATO leaders say Moscow cannot dictate the alliance's moves or undermine its open door membership policies.
Interestingly, analysts do not actually have a single answer to the question of why Putin is accumulating troops along the border right now. Ukraine's intentions to join NATO are not new, neither is the Alliance's activity new, nor are Putin's new aspirations to increase the country's borders. Even more recent, according to some analysts, is the growing crisis that threatens Russia, which has led Putin to step up his ""external enemy"" - who will instead blame him for tightening his belt, which is threatening the Russians.
In addition, after the coup in Afghanistan, Putin said that there was no danger that the United States would become embroiled in a possible military showdown. The change of power in the United States is also expected to contribute to this. While Putin and Donald Trump steered relatively calmly, Joe Biden is said to be much less at the behest of the Russian ruler. The role of the United States in the conflict cannot be ignored, even though Europe is undoubtedly more sensitive to the consequences of escalating tensions.
So how did we end up close to a military conflict in a few months?
On March 17 last year, Biden agreed in a television interview that Putin was a ""killer,"" which infuriated Russia so much that it temporarily recalled its ambassador, Anatoly Antonov. In the following months, Putin, who faced opposition protests and criticism at home, steadily strengthened anti-American and anti-Ukrainian positions and fanned his emotions by warning that Russia was threatened by external enemies.
On March 30, Russia then began massively strengthening its military presence near the border with Ukraine, prompting then-Ukrainian military commander Ruslan Komchak to warn that Russian action was threatening Ukraine.
Russia withdrew some forces in April, but left most of its equipment in place, the Washington Post points out. By October, however, it had restored its military presence near Ukraine.
To bolster the message of military power, Russia launched a Caliber missile in the Sea of ​​Japan on April 6. It also conducted Zircon rocket tests throughout the year. Putin also boasted that Russian hypersonic missiles are world leaders.
On April 15, the U.S. then reacted. Biden announced the expulsion of ten Russian diplomats and imposed sanctions on 32 individuals and companies accused of meddling in the U.S. presidential election and spreading misinformation. All in all, it was in addition to sanctions over the near-death poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in August 2020. Russia responded by expelling U.S. diplomatic staff and U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan temporarily left Russia, the Washington Post adds.
A summit in Geneva followed on 16 June, when Biden and Putin spoke only about continuing talks on arms control and cyber security. The Kremlin described the meeting as ""quite positive"".
But on June 23, the British warship HMS Defender sailed near Crimea, which Russia annexed to Ukraine in 2014, which Moscow understood as a sign that NATO does not recognize the water as Russian. Russia said it fired warning shots, and Putin later said he could sink the ship if he wanted to.
On June 30, on the eve of NATO's Sea Breeze naval exercise with Ukraine in the Black Sea, Putin said Western military support for Ukraine was creating ""significant security concerns"" for Russia.
The next interesting date is July 12, when Putin, in his long essay “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians,” actually paved the way for a possible re-aggression against Ukraine. He asserted that Russia and Ukraine are ""one people - one whole"", but also that Ukrainian sovereignty ""is possible only in partnership with Russia"".
However, according to analysts, some additional fuel for the fire was added by events that did not actually have a direct connection with Ukraine. On August 31, Afghanistan slipped into complete chaos in a short time after a quick U.S. withdrawal. The Kremlin understood it all as a sign of American decline, but also as proof that it was unlikely that Washington would send its forces back to distant places.
On September 10, Russia then conducted its extensive West 2021 military exercises to demonstrate its new fighting force after years of modernization. Russia also complained at the time about NATO flights and naval patrols on its western border.
On October 6, NATO announced the expulsion of eight diplomats from Russia's NATO mission for alleged espionage, and Russia quickly suspended its NATO mission and closed NATO's office in Moscow.
In late October, Ukraine used a Turkish Bayraktar drone for the first time in its war against Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. By the end of the month, Russia had resumed its military reinforcement near Ukraine, sparking new fears of a mass invasion.
In mid-November, Putin then accused the West of ignoring ""red line warnings"", citing Ukraine's aspirations to join NATO. He said Russia's ""tough policy"" works.
In late November, however, he complained about NATO's missile defense system in Romania and the Alliance's plan for a similar network in Poland. Putin warned that Moscow would never accept missile systems in Ukraine.
On December 7, in a video meeting, US President Biden Putin warned of severe economic sanctions if Russia invaded Ukraine. Putin, among other things, demanded that NATO abandon its eastward expansion.
On December 23, the traditional press conference of the Russian president followed, at which he strengthened his combat rhetoric. He said the West had brought missiles ""to our doorstep"" and that Moscow needed security guarantees ""immediately and now"".
On December 30, Biden and Putin made another call in a month. Biden reiterated his warning against Western sanctions, unprecedented if Russia invades Ukraine. Putin, however, warned that such an act by the West would lead to a complete breakdown of relations.
On January 7 this year, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels that the threat of conflict in the light of Russia's threat to Ukraine was ""real"". He expressed regret that Russia had not taken action to reduce tensions and continued to accumulate military forces along the border with Ukraine. He emphasized that NATO was ready for a dialogue with Moscow, but also for a possible failure of talks. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron have said that Europe will decide on Europe's security architecture in response to the fact that the EU is excluded from talks between Russia and the United States on the issue. Macron also said dialogue does not mean concessions.
On January 10, high-ranking US and Russian officials began talks in Geneva to reduce tensions. There was no breakthrough, both sides insisted on their own.
On January 14, Ukrainian authorities attributed responsibility for a large-scale cyber attack in the country to Russia. NATO has announced plans to deepen cyber cooperation with Ukraine.
On January 18, Britain began sending light anti-tank weapons to Ukraine for fear of Russian invasion and further escalation of tensions in Ukraine. British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace said they were doing so in order to ""improve defense capabilities"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile, said Russia was waiting for a response to its demands for security guarantees provided by the United States and NATO before resuming talks on the Ukrainian crisis.
On January 20, Russia announced that it would conduct naval exercises in the Atlantic, Arctic, Pacific and Mediterranean by the end of February. The announcement of the military exercises came after Moscow announced that it had successfully tested the launch of a maneuverable Caliber missile aimed at land from a submarine in the Sea of ​​Japan. The United States and Germany, however, called on Russia to take measures to de-escalate, stressing that any further Russian aggression would have ""serious consequences"".
On January 22, a U.S. cargo plane carrying 90 tons of military equipment landed at the airport in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.
On 24 January, NATO Allies then increased the level of readiness of their forces and sent additional ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe. The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, has ordered all family members of diplomats and other employees at the U.S. embassy in Kiev to leave the country. Earlier, Britain accused Russia of intending to put a pro-Russian president at the head of Ukraine. London also claims that Russian intelligence has already made contact with a number of Ukrainian politicians. Moscow dismissed the claims as misinformation.

Putin as a violent man or what he writes in a notorious essay
One of the most interesting and telling moments of the crisis is the content of Putin's essay.
""When Vladimir Putin writes about Ukraine, he sounds like a violent man."" With these words, a 5,000-word essay published by the Russian president in July was described in the Financial Times.
It is full of statements about endless love for Ukrainians - combined with threats of violence if love is not mutual. Ukrainians are portrayed as blood brothers of Russians, as well as neo-Nazis.
Volodymyr Zelensky, President of Ukraine, joked that Putin must have a lot of time to be able to write such a long article.
But the content is not to be joked about, while nearly 130,000 Russian troops are deployed near the Ukrainian border, as well as tanks and artillery.
In the essay, Putin highlights the historical, linguistic, ethnic and religious ties that connect Russia and Ukraine. He points out that these ties existed long before the Soviet Union. Putin, who is often accused of Soviet nostalgia, condemns Soviet leaders for planting the ""most dangerous time bomb"" under Russia-Ukraine ties - by granting one part the right to secede. ""Russia was really robbed,"" the president said.
At the outpouring of love, however, he insists that Ukraine has failed a country deceived by intriguing foreigners. The West, he hints, is playing a ""dangerous geopolitical game"" and intends to use Ukraine as a ""stepping stone against Russia."" It is an argument that hints that the invasion of Ukraine would be of a defensive nature and that it can be avoided if NATO gives in.
But the price of the concession would actually be high and not be tied only to Ukraine.
Poroshenko: The world should unite against Putin
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, meanwhile, believes that ""the world should unite against Putin"".
Poroshenko also recently told CNN that Ukraine should be allowed to join NATO.
The billionaire led Ukraine between 2014 and 2019, taking power soon after Russia invaded and then annexed Crimea. He was then defeated by incumbent President Zelenski in the 2019 presidential election. ""It is really necessary that there be international solidarity and unity against Vladimir Putin,"" Poroshenko said, warning Western leaders that the Russian leader should not be trusted.
He also called for tougher international sanctions against Russia: ""We need to make Russia weaker, and we can do that with sanctions. We should make Ukraine stronger.""
Poroshenko believes that the Russian leader does not yet know whether the Russian invasion will really happen, but he called it a ""crazy decision"" and said that the international community should ""significantly increase the price Putin should pay if Russian forces would cross the Ukrainian border. ""
But sanctions will require a single agreement. Some find it questionable, as there will be no shortage of interests. Although the current situation is complicated by many actors and interests, it is essentially simple - rattling with weapons on the border of an independent state is unacceptable. And countries that are considering supporting Moscow in the light of their own interests should first consider the long-term consequences for other “potential hotspots” if Russian behavior becomes acceptable.
Putin's goals
However, given the fact that Ukraine is a sovereign state with the right to make its own decisions and does not have to dance to the rhythm dictated by Putin, concessions are not possible either because there is no indication that Putin will stop at the Ukrainian border. .
The logic of Putin’s love-hate letter is that Ukraine’s independence is in itself a historical anomaly that needs to be corrected. With the annexation of Crimea, only the first step was taken.
With the ""correction of anomalies"" and the revival of the former ""Russian greatness"", Putin is said to be still angry about the loss of influence over the Ukrainians. The Ukrainian system is corrupt and dysfunctional in many ways. But the country has regular elections that are not staged, and a vibrant civil society that does not want to revive Russian patterns."

Among other things, Janša pointed out that a comprehensive and free Europe is calling for a new beginning. Pahor did not shy away from relations with China and Russia, stressing that peace and dialogue must always prevail. But how are foreign diplomats monitoring the escalation of tensions in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict? And why was there no Chinese ambassador among those gathered? Was this also influenced by the Prime Minister's statement on Taiwan?","The Prime Minister suggested several views on the future of the European Union. ""A comprehensive and free Europe calls for a new beginning, but also that with the end of the division of Europe we will strive for a new quality of our security relations, while fully respecting the freedom of choice of each other,"" said Janez Janša, Prime Minister. The President did not miss the opportunity to remind the following of Janša's recent statements on the exchange of missions with Taiwan. ""Since the establishment of diplomatic relations with China, Slovenia has consistently defended the principle of one China, which is also the policy of the European Union,"" said President Borut Pahor.
Among the several missing diplomats was the Chinese. And if there is a fear of the cooling of Slovenian-Chinese relations, it is far from the cooling of the Russian-Ukrainian front. ""At this moment, I especially emphasize the need for a constructive and substantive dialogue between the West and the Russian Federation, and together with political and military allies we rightly expect to refrain from all forms of threats by force,"" Pahor added. On the Ukrainian side, however, it is clear: we must not be left alone.
""All the European Union and all countries should give a strong signal to the Russian side that they must not violate the existing rule, because the consequences would be really strong. It is not about Ukraine, but about Europe, European values, respect for international law and the rule of law."" ""says Mikhail F. Brodovich, Ukrainian ambassador. Timur Eyvazov, the Russian ambassador, said: ""We have no intention of going to war. We are a very friendly and peaceful country. In fact, our positions have already been explained in detail. We expect answers to our proposals this week."" the minister did not comment today, the European Union will not act like the United States and evacuate the families of diplomats from Ukraine. After Monday's crisis talks with European leaders, US President Joe Biden declared full unity among allies, and the Pentagon also announced the readiness of NATO's 40,000-strong response force to take action against Russia if necessary."

Most of them were T-shirts with the words: 'Where is Peng Shuai?'. The Chinese have not yet been able to speak to foreign media after revealing the abuses, and the WTA president has already canceled his participation in all Chinese tournaments, but this has not changed China's status. The latter spoke for some Chinese media, she also appeared at several public events, but the majority of the world public does not believe that these are genuine and unforced scenes.
Interestingly, the lifting of the ban on wearing T-shirts and banners at Australian Open stadiums came less than 24 hours after the organizers, the Australian Tennis Association, publicly defended their original decision by banning political tickets. or commercial inscriptions.
Australian Tennis Association Executive Director Craig Tiley told The Sydney Morning Herald now: ""If anyone wants to wear a T-shirt in support of Peng Shuai, that's fine."""
https://www.24ur.com/sport/zimski_sporti/pokljuka-ima-dober-polozaj-med-prireditelji-svetovnega-pokala.html,Pokljuka has a good position among the organizers of the World Cup,"Pokljuka has been filled with young biathletes at the IBU Cup and the European Open for Junior Members over the past two weeks. The Secretary General of the International Biathlon Federation of Sweden, Niklas Carlsson, also watched the competitions, giving the Slovenian organizers and Pokljuka a very positive assessment.","""I am glad that I returned here after last year's extraordinary experience at the World Championships. The organization here was also very good. The Organizing Committee is doing an excellent job here, which ranks Pokljuka high among the organizers,"" he praised the Slovenian organizers. Niklas Carlsson.
This does not hide the fact that the situation is difficult for the organizers of biathlon competitions. The demand for the World Cup is very high. At least for now, the standard calendar includes an introduction in Östersund, a New Year's tour in Oberhof, Ruhpolding and Anterselva, and more or less also matches in Hochfilzn and Oslo.
Among other strong organizers in terms of infrastructure, and especially after the visit of spectators, stand out Novo Mesto in the Czech Republic and with the latest performance also the French Annecy. There is a lot of interest in Kontiolahti, exceptionally a North American tour is on the agenda, Russian organizers who are also ready to return are currently excluded due to penalties, they are also increasingly active in Lenzerheide, Switzerland ...
""It is good for us, of course, to have so many organizers. The fight is fierce and there is no room for everyone. Pokljuka will also have a trophy, but not every year,"" adds Carlsson. He also emphasizes how important it is for venues to host smaller matches where the financial proceeds are virtually nil. This is one of the reasons why Pokljuka took over the canceled match from Austria this year and added the open European Championship to it.
The number of spectators is also important
The only visible problem of Pokljuka is the number of spectators. In Pokljuka, Slovenian organizers are limited by natural resources and cannot even provide space for 25 or 30 thousand visitors, as many as are hosted by the largest in the World Cup. Slovenian achievements in recent years are also worrying, as visits always depend on competitive success. They benefit from good organization and, above all, the conditions that are popular with most competitors. ""Spectators are one of the factors, of course. You don't have to worry too much about that, but of course it's something we also look at,"" says the Swede.
He adds that despite the covida-19 pandemic, biathlon is still in good shape after two shortened seasons. ""We have great television ratings. Obviously we have a good program that invites viewers, but also within our members, biathlon is developing more and more, there are more and more competitive competitors and these are the starting points on which we must focus our work.""
They want to organize mixed doubles matches
As he says, there is no fear for the coming years either. In 14 days, the Olympic Games will start as the main event, then the World Championships will be hosted by Oberhof and Novo Mesto, in 2025 by the Swiss Lenzerheide, and in four years by the Olympic Games in Milan. Cortini d'Ampezzo. There will also be an attractive mixed doubles match as part of the games program, if the IBU wishes.
""We are trying to stay innovative and bring about change. The most important thing is to include athletes, television, media partners and viewers in this story. We have to take all this into account,"" he said of the new Olympic discipline. .
The success and popularity of biathlon, however, is not self-evident. The IBU is constantly monitoring its partners, and over the past two seasons, the federation has strongly supported both individual national federations and organizers during the pandemic. ""Everything else was solved somehow, we are only sorry for the spectators who could not watch the matches live,"" says Carlsson.
According to Carlsson, the wide help to its members and partners is the reason for the wide level of biathlon, where competitors from as many as 20 countries can be among the top ten, which is almost non-existent in other snow sports. This is where the good policy of the IBU is shown, which supports sport even in those countries where there is no real tradition and national federations, so it is difficult to find sponsors."

The value of bitcoin has reached its lowest level in six months, and the decline in value coincides with a rather gloomy mood in the financial markets.","After a brief stabilization, the value of bitcoin fell again today, reaching its lowest level in six months. According to the German news agency dpa, its value in the early afternoon was around 32,970 dollars (about 29,113 euros). At around 7.30 pm, its value on the Bitstamp stock exchange rose to around $ 35,890 (around $ 31,704).
As early as Thursday, bitcoin, otherwise the oldest and most well-known cryptocurrency, was worth about $ 10,000 more. Other cryptocurrencies, such as ether, number two in the markets, also lost something again today after a brief stabilization of value.
There are currently about 17,000 digital currencies worth a total of a good $ 1 trillion earlier this week. Before the last falls, they were worth more than $ 2,000 billion, writes dpa.
The fall in the value of cryptocurrencies, according to experts, coincides with a rather gloomy mood in the financial markets. One of the reasons for this is the growing geopolitical tensions, especially the fear of an outbreak of armed conflict in Ukraine. In addition, monetary policy in the United States is expected to tighten earlier than expected in the fight against inflation.
Rising interest rates, however, are very bad news, especially for risky investments such as investments in cryptocurrencies, as they increase the attractiveness of investments that give a sense of safe and profitable investment, such as government bonds, analysts say.
The cryptocurrency market has also been hit by a critical stance by Russia's central bank, which last week proposed a ban on the use of cryptocurrencies. Russia is considered one of the centers of cryptocurrency mining, which takes place with complex calculations in computer systems.
The value of bitcoin fell below the $ 40,000 mark for the first time since last September on January 10th. At the time, its value on the Bitstamp stock market hovered at around $ 39,559, which was about 40 percent below the record value of about $ 69,000 that bitcoin reached on November 10th."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kangler-zavrnil-ocitke-predsednika-preiskovalne-komisije-o-politicnem-vmesavanju-v-delo-policije.html,Medved: It is not a matter for the Secretary of State to order the work of a commission of inquiry,"State Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior Franc Kangler rejected the accusations of the chairman of the commission of inquiry, Rudi Medved (LMŠ), which is investigating suspicions of political interference in the work of the Police regarding the influence of politics on staffing. However, Medved emphasizes that it is not a matter for the Secretary of State to order the work of the commission of inquiry.","According to Kangler, Medved said many untruths in a statement after Friday's session of the commission of inquiry. He emphasized that it was untrue to confirm allegations of strong political involvement in staffing the police. ""It's an obvious lie, with nothing, I didn't confirm it with one statement,"" Kangler said in a statement today.
He estimates that at the hearing before the commission of inquiry he proved that the career system is valid and still exists in the Police. “This career system is present in all pores of the Police at the local and regional level, as well as at the General Police Administration,” he said.
The police, Kangler says, do their job professionally, expertly, legally, quickly and efficiently.
He also commented on the interim report of the commission, which in his opinion is one-sided, biased, without a single piece of evidence, where they claim that the influence of politics on staffing in the police is too great. He also accuses Medved of not wanting to face the 2016 and 2021 reports on the oversight of the National Investigation Office.
Medved: It is not a matter for the Secretary of State to order the work of a commission of inquiry
The Bear has already responded to Kangler's allegations today. As he said in a statement to the media, it is not a matter for the Secretary of State to order the work of the commission of inquiry. He also cannot know which documents the commission will look at.
According to him, these controls were highly politically motivated, and he wonders why the Secretary of State would now impose on them from a position of political power something that we know was done with political motivation and that these documents are, we can assume, biased.
Medved pointed out that the testimonies of the people were the most valuable for the commission during all this time. ""There has never been such a political interference in the staffing of the Police as now. This will be confirmed by many who have been employed in the Slovenian Police for many years. The ruling politics has simply subjugated and usurped the staffing system itself,"" he said.
He added that the commission had never claimed that there were no security checks in personnel matters. “Of course they take place, they just don’t take them into account,” he said. He added that more than half of the witnesses heard so far confirmed the allegations of the commission of inquiry: from political staffing, gross interference in the organizational structure of the Police and also interference in pre-trial proceedings."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/robert-golob_2.html,Golob: I will give my award in full to humanitarian organizations,"Before the elections, the activities of (future) political actors are intensifying. Regarding the role of the former CEO of Gen-I, Robert Golob, there are still many open questions, which could be answered soon. After holding talks with KUL leaders, Golob announced that he would run for president at the mid-congress of the Green Actions party (Z.Dej). He also reaffirmed his commitment to green policies and changes in political culture. He also revealed that he will donate his business award to humanitarian organizations.","Robert Golob presents Gen-I's business results for 2021 at a press conference. He is also expected to answer journalists' questions related to his political activation and role in the upcoming parliamentary elections.
He said he made his decision and withdrew his consent for management. ""I will no longer sit in the next administration. Sometimes it is time for change. I have decided to change myself. My salary is important also because I do not hide it. All speculation is therefore unnecessary. Because we had a fantastic year 2021 , I am also entitled to a record award. It is not yet known what this award will be. It is not up to me, but to the owners, the auditor and the assembly, which will take place in June this year. ""In addition to withdrawing from the company, I also certified another statement with the notary. I decided to give the award in full to humanitarian organizations. From now on, the higher the award, the happier I will be. Nine humanitarian organizations will receive this award,"" he promised. .
Golob announced some time ago that he would not form a new party, but would join one of the parties. It is the Green Action Party (Z.Dej), whose congress is scheduled to take place on Wednesday. ""On Wednesday, the Z.Dej party has a congress, the president has resigned, we will see what happens,"" said Golob, who said he would run for party president.
Everything else will be heard at the congress first by members of the Z.Dej party, he said, as this is the only fair thing. ""It's respect - not to find out in the media. Only then will I be able to expect respect from them,"" he explained. He added that this is a key difference between politicians who like to brag about what they will do and between “us from the real world who prefer to brag about what we have managed to do and share with others”.
Regarding the political and social climate and the accusations of the Minister of the Economy Zdravko Počivalšek that his salary was not paid in accordance with the law, he said that in Slovenia we obviously live in two parallel worlds. ""We have a political world that lives on Twitter, and we have another, real world that we can call the rule of law."" As he said, in some ministries - he especially mentioned the Ministry of the Economy - the rule of law operates in parallel with the tvitosphere. ""The political tweetosphere lives in its own world, a world of anger, hatred, despair, contempt ... This is not my world and I hope that in the near future it will no longer be the world of Slovenia.""
Already in his presentation, he repeatedly hinted that the mistakes in the country will be ""corrected in April"". He cited green and digital and investing in people as the focus of his work in politics. He believes that political culture needs to be changed, because without a change in political culture, there can be no change in the country. ""Anger and fear only lead to doom, this applies to both the individual and the state,"" Golob said.
He also said that his next job will probably be in the parliament, but added that he does not decide on that himself.
In a recent interview with Večer, Golob said that as many as six political parties had proposed to him. Some time ago, we reported that Zoran Janković offered him the Positive Slovenia party.
Golob, who has recently started organizing debates to which he has invited some prominent representatives of political life in our country, public opinion polls show considerable support. A recent Mediana poll reveals that even before he actually entered politics, he was the fourth most popular politician in the country, after Ljudmila Novak, Borut Pahor and Janez Poklukar. When asked who is the best candidate for the composition of the future government, he is in second place with 17.5 percent.
Last week, Golob met with representatives of LMŠ, Levice and SAB. As LMŠ president Marjan Šarec explained at a press conference on Friday, there is a possibility of his party cooperating with Golob, but only if he agrees with the ten commitments set out in the KUL coalition agreement. In Levica, the meeting with Golob was described as informative.
The SAB, however, denied allegations in the media that it would be linked to Golob before the elections, especially if the SAB did not appear to be able to cross the parliamentary threshold. The SAB said it would stick to the commitment made by the KUL coalition, and after the election that they would be willing to talk to anyone who shares their values.
Regarding speculations that Golob will join the Club of Independent Mayors, Vladimir Prebilič said that their meeting had not (yet) taken place.
Gen-I operated with more than $ 70 million in profits
Presenting Gen-I's business results, Golob said that last year we faced three crises - health, energy and politics. ""None of these crises have distracted us from this key mission. But we have not forgotten our customers. We remain committed to keeping prices frozen at least until the summer,"" he said.
He boasted that the company had achieved all the milestones and plans it had set for itself, and that 2021 was the most successful year in Gen-I history. ""The company's profit has increased four times and is more than 71 million euros. We have not stopped, we have increased investments by more than 50 percent. All investments are in digital and green. We have also increased the volume of business. Gen-I is on the path of a global company. We have provided cheap electricity for 25,000 Slovenian families. "" According to him, Gen-I is the most successful energy company in Slovenia.
""The success of the company is based on a positive entrepreneurial culture and knowledge. It would be nice to say the same for our country. Maybe we could be another Switzerland.""
He also emphasized the company's role in caring for the environment. ""We are not only promoters of solar power plants, but we are also building them. We have built 3,300 solar power plants for 'ordinary' people. All these people have become practically energy independent.""
Golob currently remains employed at Gen-I, as of November 18 last year he is the director of the strategic energy procurement portfolio management, he will be employed at Gen-I until he gets another job, which is likely to be in parliament. According to him, the business results for last year show that the company is the best even without the management, which is why it is so much easier to withdraw. ""Because I know Gen-I is the best, even if I'm not in charge. There's no better heritage than that,"" he added."

Banned at the Australian Open,"The Chinese tennis player, who disappeared from public life after accusing a former high-ranking Chinese politician of sexual assault, has yet to speak directly to the WTA Players' Council. Many players in the world of tennis care about her safety. Now, however, the organizers of the OP Australia are banning visitors to the venues in Melbourne who bring with them banners and T-shirts in support of China.","In November last year, former world number one tennis player in the women's doubles competition Peng Shuai disappeared to nowhere, a week after announcing that she had been forced into sex by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party, Gaoli Chang. Thirty-five-year-old Shuai accused Chang, 75, of forcing her to have sex with him. The revelation of the abuse was part of a lengthy post she uploaded to Weibo, the Chinese version of Facebook. The post was soon deleted and all of its content on the site was cleared.
After public pressure on Chinese authorities, the tennis player appeared in mid-December in an interview with Singapore newspaper Lianhe Zaobao. ""It must be absolutely clear to everyone that I have never condemned anyone for sexually assaulting or harassing me. I would like to be very clear about this and there should be no doubt,"" the Chinese woman said. ""No one has restricted me and no one has controlled me. I am completely free all the time and I am asking for these theories to stop. I am here and I feel great,"" she added at the time.
Nevertheless, the World Women's Tennis Federation (WTA) still cares about her safety. Therefore, the WTA for the 2022 season canceled all tennis tournaments under his auspices, which were announced in China. Victoria Azarenka, a member of the WTA Players' Council, confirmed that despite their many attempts, Shuayev has still not contacted them. ""I hope that at some point we will be able to talk to her in person. I think that is our main goal at the moment,"" Azarenka said.
World number one Ashley Barty takes care of China. ""We all hope she's fine. I hope she's here with us soon,"" the Australian said.
OP Australia without political inscriptions
The Australian Tennis Federation insists that safety is their ""primary concern"", although Australian Open organizers have demanded that fans remove T-shirts and banners reading ""Where's Peng Shuai?"" At Melbourne venues. Last weekend, Australian activist Drew Pavlou posted a video on Twitter in which one of the security guards at the Melbourne scene demanded that he and Hong Kong Democratic Rights activist Max Mok remove T-shirts and banners with the caption.
The security guard and activists were later joined by a police officer, who confirmed that they were violating the rules set by the tennis association. “I’m not saying you can’t have that opinion, but the tennis association is setting the rules here,” a police officer told the activists. The Australian Tennis Association confirmed his words: ""In accordance with our terms of entry, we do not allow clothing, banners or signs that are commercial or political."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/mediana_9.html,"Despite record infections most popular politician Poklukar, low support for the government again","The Mediana Institute for Market and Media Research again asked about support for political parties. Support for the government remains low, although the SDS is still leading among the parties in January, and its advantage over the SD has diminished. At the top of the list of politicians is the Minister of Health Janez Poklukar, followed by the President of the Republic Borut Pahor and the NSi MEP Ljudmila Novak.","
According to the Mediana Institute for Market and Media Research, public support for the government remains low. The Janša government starts the year with one-third support (33.8%). More than half of the respondents (56.3%) oppose it, and one in ten (10.0%) is undecided.
Among the parties, the SDS is still leading in January, but its advantage has diminished. If the elections were held today, the largest government party would be surrounded by a good 16 percent of voters (16.3%). Others are the Social Democrats, who would be elected by just over 11 percent (11.3%) of the people. They are followed by the Left (7.6%) and the Marjan Šarc List (6.3%), which overtook Nova Slovenija (4.6%).
Alenka Bratušek's party is fifth (4.3%), ahead of the National Party (3.6%). Then only political change for Pirates (1.6%), Desus (1.2%) and Good Country (1.0%). The coalition Konkretno Zdravka Počivalška recorded less than half a percent of public support (0.2%).
By far the largest party remains undecided. More than a fifth (22.7%) of respondents do not know which party they would surround. Almost one in ten (9.1%) would not choose any of the existing policy options. The rest did not want to answer (2.2%).
At the top of the list of politicians is Health Minister Janez Poklukar
And a scale of politicians. Despite the record number of infected people, the Minister of Health Janez Poklukar returned to the top. The second is the President of the Republic Borut Pahor, in front of NSi MEP Ljudmila Novak.
He is followed by Robert Golob, who is just entering state politics. SD President Tanja Fajon is two places behind him. The President of the National Assembly Igor Zorčič is ninth.
NSi champion Matej Tonin is in the middle of the list, ahead of the Prime Minister and SDS Janez Janša and SAB President Alenko Bratušek.
They are followed by the coordinator of the Left Luka Mesec and the president of the LMŠ Marjan Šarec. The leader of the party Konkretno Zdravko Počivalšek is the seventeenth.
And who, in the opinion of the respondents, would be the best mandatary for the composition of the future government? The current prime minister was chosen by more than 20 percent of voters, and the second choice was Golob with 17.5 percent. With just under eight percent, Fajon would land in third place. They are followed by Šarec with six percent and Mesec, chosen by five percent of respondents.
KUL expects programmatic positions from Golob as soon as possible
Robert Golob announced his entry into state politics weeks ago, but remained secretive about how and with whom. According to the latest unofficial information, he is supposed to take over the Green Actions party of Jure Lebn, which has not shown the best in terms of entering parliament so far.
He is supposed to take over only its framework - the name is supposed to be new, as is the team, and a new leadership will be elected at the congress, which is supposed to take place in the new week. Golob is holding a press conference on Monday on Gen-i's business results, when he is also expected to provide other details.
In recent days, he has already met with each leader of the KUL coalition separately. In it, Golob sees allies, but intends to fight for votes on his own. With this, he will probably shuffle KUL's cards as well. On the last scale, the respondents have a second choice for prime minister, immediately after Janez Janša and in front of all coalition leaders.
That there are still three months until the elections, which is an extremely long time, says Fajonova, who emphasizes that this is a new and still relatively unknown project and that many more things can happen before the elections. ""We are an extremely vulnerable political environment, unpredictable. I don't think we will know until the last minute who will lead,"" he added.
""There has been a lot of disappointment with new faces in the past. I don't want anything like this to happen in this election,"" Bratuskova said.
Therefore, KUL also expects Golob to have programmatic starting points as soon as possible, so that it will be clear what he will stand for."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/dodik-bih-je-propadli-projekt-razhod-je-najboljsa-moznost.html,"Dodik: BiH is a failed project, exit is the best option","In an interview with the Spanish newspaper El Mundo, the Serbian member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina Milorad Dodik said that Bosnia and Herzegovina was a failed project and that the best solution for the country was to disperse Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats in BiH in a civilized way.","""BiH cannot exist for the same reason that Yugoslavia could not exist. There are three nations in BiH. Two of them, Croats and Serbs, are very dissatisfied. Muslims are trying to establish a unitary state with a dominant nation,"" he said. said Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik.
He added that the policy of Serbs in BiH is not aimed at secession, but speaks of ""another option based on the assessment that BiH will not be successful as a state"". “If so, the best way out is in a civilized way,” he added.
He stressed that Serbs ""will not start a war for secession"", and reiterated that separation is the best option ""if we cannot live together"". He added that BiH exists as a state only because of pressure from the international community.
""It's an alien experiment,"" Dodik said. According to him, the High Representative of the International Community in BiH Christian Schmidt has no right to introduce laws in BiH. ""The first thing I suggest is that foreigners end the administration of this country, as (BiH) is the only colony that currently exists in Europe. Let them allow us to find consensus, if possible,"" Dodik added."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/fokus/ni-cloveka-ni-problema.html,"'No man, no problem'","A tragic accident, when a 10-year-old Kurdish girl drowned in the Dragonja river, exposed all the cruelty, ruthlessness and brutality of the Slovenian asylum system. After rescuing the girl from the cold river, the girl's mother was immediately handed over to the Croatian police. Why is Slovenian migration policy so restrictive and harsh? Why is it exhausting? How is it on the southern border when the sun goes down and the cold presses? Where does the discourse come from that people are coming, a danger that will overwhelm us? What is it like to flee to Slovenia?","Today, 42-year-old Mansouri fled from Iran to Slovenia - along the so-called Balkan refugee route - six years ago. He hoped that his ordeal would end - by applying for international protection in Slovenia. And it is not. He is still waiting for the final decision of the Ministry of the Interior. ""Whatever the administrative court decides on your case, the Home Office appeals. And then it waits. It then goes to the Supreme Court, it comes back. It's such a ping pong, and you're in the middle of it.""
This is exactly what - obtaining refugee status - is one of the major problems of Slovenian asylum policy, explains Zana Fabjan Blažič from the Working Group on Asylum, where they have been helping asylum seekers and refugees for years. ""The entire asylum system is made in such a way that it exhausts people, that they despair, then deport themselves home or go somewhere else. There is no man, no problem. People just need to be tortured to the point that they will leave Slovenia alone because they are clearly not welcome here. ""
This harsh and uncompromising migration and asylum policy - Uroš Škerl Kramberger, a journalist with the Dnevnik newspaper, who has been following the fate of refugees for years, is clear - largely marked 2015, when more than 360,000 refugees crossed Slovenia. Even after the numbers have fallen, the apparatus - if I may say so - has remained convinced that the border must be protected, that refugees are in danger of - they use the term - we will be overwhelmed. And this is still happening. , even now that the numbers are much lower. ""
Urša Regvar from the Legal Information Center of Non-Governmental Organizations is clear about how cruel, ruthless and inhuman the Slovenian asylum system is, the tragic death of a barely 10-year-old Kurdish girl in the Dragonja river and the fate of her family. ""The events at the border when a Kurdish girl died are basically a clear indication of how closed Slovenia is. A mother, even after losing her child, could not apply for asylum in Slovenia. The very clear question is how the fact that she did not apply for asylum, given that she was a vulnerable person, whether she had the opportunity at all, the police instructed her about it and whether she nevertheless returned her to Croatia. ""
Police violence, shocking footage of self-harm ...
Another indicator of the closed asylum policy is the return of refugees to the Croatian security authorities. Namely, Slovenia is still doing this on the basis of an intergovernmental agreement on the return of aliens; in the last four years it has returned more than 29,000 people to Croatia, before that only a few hundred a year. And it does so despite the fact that it is known what is happening in Croatia, that refugees are often beaten and intimidated there before being driven south to Bosnia and Herzegovina. If the Slovenian police fail to return the refugees to Croatia immediately, they often lock them up in the Postojna center for foreigners before removing them from the country. For some time now, applicants for international protection, whose movement has been restricted by the Ministry of the Interior, have also been detained there. According to non-governmental organizations, refugees have been imprisoned in the center for days, weeks and months. Without the possibility to appeal, legal aid is very limited. Recently, testimonies of police violence and shocking footage of self-harm have been coming from the Postojna center again, says Uroš Škerl Kramberger. It’s not officially a prison, but it has all the elements of a prison and there are people imprisoned who aren’t perpetrators of crime. , what we've seen so far from the Aliens Center. ""
Refugees are once again knocking on European doors more en masse. According to Frontex, almost 200,000 people crossed the European Union's external borders last year, the most since 2017. More than 65,000 via the Mediterranean, 60,000 via the Western Balkans. 8,000 people tried to travel to Europe via the new Eastern route - from Belarus to Poland and Lithuania. In most cases - due to closed European borders - the despair and helplessness of people fleeing to safety has been exploited by smugglers. Robert Črepinko, head of the Europol Center for Combating Migrant Smuggling, also confirms this in an interview with 24UR Fokus with figures. ""When the European Center against Migrant Smuggling was set up, we estimated that around 90% of migrants use smuggling services. Now I would dare to predict that this percentage is even higher. Personally, I can't imagine being able to get to a European Union destination. without the services of smugglers being used on at least one part of this route. And, of course, these services are also very expensive. ""

Although they have signed a post-election agreement, the presidents of the KUL parties met with him separately. But they do not want to rush into announcements of possible pre- or post-election integration, but will wait for Golob to actually become part of a new or existing party with a clear program.","The main faces of the opposition quartet have now officially broken the ice with the first talks with the new-old political face.

This is the first step towards potential cooperation, which will be necessary at the party-fragmented left pole if they want to form a new government, which was also recognized by those who may not have seen Robert Golob at first as an ally.
A few days ago, Šarec said: ""Better Šarec in his hand than Golob on the roof."" Does he still insist on this statement after yesterday's meeting? ""Yes, what is already better is always better than what is not yet. But as far as we know, this is expected to change soon,"" Šarec commented.

According to the former ambassador, Slovenia has so far defended the policy of one China, which is also the official policy of the EU, and in her opinion this should be the case in the future as well. Next Friday, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly will discuss Janša's statements on Taiwan.","In an interview with Indian television Doordarshan, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa revealed, among other things, that talks were under way with Taiwan on an ""exchange of representations"". At the same time, he was critical of China for its harsh response to Lithuania's decision to open its diplomatic mission in Taipei and allow Taiwanese in Vilnius.
As the former ambassador to Germany and Switzerland and one of the founders of the Ona ve Marta Kos association pointed out, the updated foreign policy strategy, which will be discussed by the parliamentary foreign policy committee next week, does not mention the Taiwan issue. She explained that Taiwan has offices in 20 member states of the European Union, but under the name Taipei. Only Lithuania decided to use the official name of the word Taiwan.
Kosova also pointed out that Slovenia has so far defended the policy of one China, which is also the official policy of the EU. ""It should be the same in the future,"" she said.
Kosovo is advising the Prime Minister to think strategically before commenting on China
The Slovenian Prime Minister did not say what the new mission would be called. The opening of the office on the model of other EU members should also not be opposed. However, his comparison of how democratic Taiwan and undemocratic China are is more problematic. At the same time, his mention of the bad experience with China in Hong Kong.
The former ambassador also pointed out that China is an important partner of the European Union, but also a competitor. The fact is that he does not respect human rights, but the question is whether this should be emphasized so publicly and in such a way as the Prime Minister of Slovenia did.
Kosovo also drew attention to Slovenia's candidacy for a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2024/25. Elections will be held next year, and Slovenia has a good chance of competing with Belarus for one place in the Eastern European regional group. However, China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and has a veto, she added. He thus advises the Prime Minister on strategic considerations before declaring such matters concerning China.
In her opinion, Janša is acting contrary to the goal of Slovenian foreign policy, which is to strengthen Slovenia's reputation and recognition as a successful and recognizable member of the EU. According to him, Slovenia has recently lost ""an extremely high reputation"" precisely because of the Prime Minister and his way of communicating. ""It takes years and years to gain it in international politics, but you can lose it very quickly,"" she added.
'Ready to upset the domestic and foreign public just because they can'
Professor Ana Bojinović Fenko assessed that the Prime Minister's statements were unstrategic and unprofessional. Why this happened, however, “a different type of analysis is needed,” she said.
She added that any foreign policy action that deviates from the planned strategic framework is, in principle, bad because it is inconsistent and must be weighed against the value framework.
According to her, it is obvious that the Prime Minister's statements do not stem from a foreign policy strategy in which there is no support for the right to self-determination of nations, as was the case in the 1999 strategy.
She pointed out that the personal qualities and leadership style of the person currently serving as the Prime Minister of Slovenia are such that this person is ready to upset the domestic and foreign public only because he can. She highlighted the tweets over the undefeated victory of former President Donald Trump and the disrespectful attitude towards women, the journalistic profession, etc.
Next Friday, the OZP will also talk about Janša's statements about Taiwan
Next Friday, at the request of the KUL coalition, the Foreign Policy Committee of the National Assembly will discuss the intention to establish a Slovenian representation in Taiwan and a Taiwanese representation in Slovenia. According to the proposal, the meeting will also be able to take place behind closed doors, which will be decided by the members of the committee.
There are two items on the agenda of the session: the alleged agreement between Slovenia and Croatia regarding fishing in the Piran Bay and the discussion of the Prime Minister's Monday statements for Indian national television. The last point is signed by the parties SD, LMŠ and Levica.
Janša's statements greatly upset China, and have already caused damage to some Slovenian companies cooperating with Chinese partners. Proponents of convening a session on this topic believe that Janša's statements could have long-term consequences for relations with Asian countries and are inconsistent with Slovenia's long-term foreign policy strategy. They also drew attention to the role of the National Assembly in Slovenia's foreign policy.
Jelinčič regarding Taiwan: I think Janša made a big mistake
SNS President Zmago Jelinčič strongly condemned the Prime Minister's statements regarding Taiwan and China and called them a mistake. ""I think Mr Jansa made a big mistake by declaring Taiwan as the main starting point for economic affairs,"" he said.
He noted the importance of China as a key player in the international community, ""especially now that it is connecting with Russia, India and the entire Asian region in order to become a kind of opposite pole of the United States."" It is also an important economic partner for Slovenia. ""Such mistakes will be detrimental to Slovenia and its economy. Above all, such decisions are not taken lightly, even if we have agreed with the United States,"" he added."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kangler-na-zaslisanje-zaradi-suma-politizacije-policije.html,Bear: Kangler has exposed himself for getting involved in pre-trial proceedings,"At today's session, members of the parliamentary inquiry commission investigating suspicions of political interference in the work of the Police questioned State Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior Franc Kangler. He rejects all allegations. Commission chairman Rudi Medved said in a press release that Kangler had revealed himself that he was involved in pre-trial proceedings when he shared the content of the complaint in the Tonin case on Facebook in June 2020, which should not be available to anyone until then. except for the criminologist and the then head of the National Bureau of Investigation. Kangler rejects all allegations of interference in the work of the Police.","The commission investigating the suspicion of police politicization invited State Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior Franc Kangler to a hearing, who immediately confirmed his participation. At today's four-hour interrogation, he denied allegations of interference in the work of the Police. According to him, personnel decisions were made by the Director General of the Police.
According to the chairman of the commission of inquiry, Rudi Medved, Kangler is ""known to the public and also to the police and the interior ministry as the chief of staff of the police and the ministry"". Kangler rejected the latter, saying that the police were obviously so politicized that the commission knew the work of the police better than he did. Kangler is otherwise employed by the Home Office.
He claimed that the staffing of the Police had changed little: ""If you mean the Director General of the Police, then it is by appointing him to the government."" “The career system in the police works,” he believes.
Kangler vehemently accused former former director general of police Anton Travner of replacing then-director of the National Investigation Office (NPU) Darko Muženič, as he had recruited Travner based on experience and career system. Regarding the employment of Petra Grah Lazar at the head of the NPU and her friendship with the tax debtor Rok Snežič, Kangler said that Grah Lazarjeva and Snežič are not friends. ""If you've met someone twice in your life or you're from the same place, you're not a friend yet. It's a lie, you're doing her an injustice, spreading big lies about her,"" Kangler said.
Regarding the establishment of a special working group on migration, which is accused of withdrawing criminals who had previously dealt with cases that were not to the liking of the current political authorities, Kangler said he was in favor of the establishment proved to be a great need, especially given the events along the southern border. Kangler said the establishment of the group proved to be a success as we have fewer illegal border crossings. According to Medved, the commission finds that the group has not received any assignments.
Initially, Kangler also stated that he did not make any recommendations in the field of personnel, as he did not know these people personally. Vlado Maksimovič, formerly employed at the Maribor Police Department, was appointed head of this group, but Kangler confirmed to the commission today that he had proposed him to the Minister of the Interior, Aleš Hojs, as the group's leader.
Kangler: I do my job professionally and professionally
Asked by Nataša Sukič (Left) whether police officers exceeded their authority and ""gassed Ljubljana"" at protests in Ljubljana on October 5 last year, he said he was not responsible and reminded that the EU summit was taking place at the time. ""Some wanted to overthrow this presidency through protests,"" he added. As well as that the measures against the protesters were not excessive, as six policemen were injured by granite blocks, and only two protesters.
Sukič also asked Kangler about the house search of the Minister of Economy Zdravko Počivalšek, who was supposed to be informed about it in advance. Kangler replied that he could recall from memory that then-Police Director General Travner did not know about these house searches the day before: ""Travner did this in the morning. Then you have to ask the operative who took care of it why the information came out . ""
Asked by Medved whether he believes he can perform the function of state secretary objectively and impartially, because he cooperates with the police, where the people who investigated him ex officio are and whether he can have a professional attitude towards them, Kangler said that his he performs his work professionally and professionally, as well as the Minister of the Interior.
Kangler has repeatedly stressed that he has good and professional relations with both police unions. Regarding Minister Hojs' tweets with offensive content about police officers, Kangler replied that police officers should not be affected by such tweets. “It hurts me a lot when the MP here repeatedly points out that Hoys had unionists for lazy people and bullies, that’s not true, you know exactly who it was flying at,” Kangler added.
'The executive underestimates the work of the commission of inquiry'
The commission of inquiry has questioned twenty witnesses in just over six months, and Medved claims that the interrogations and documents have confirmed that things are going on in the Police at the behest of politics.
""Today's hearing showed that the executive power underestimates the work of the commission of inquiry,"" Medved said in the introduction. According to him, at the nearly four-hour hearing before the commission, Kangler at times behaved very arrogantly and wanted to teach her what her job was. He added that with his statements he ""only confirmed what the commission has reached so far"".
""It is a matter of strong political involvement, political staffing and interference in pre-trial proceedings,"" Medved is convinced.
He emphasized that the current government, led by the SDS party, was not taking any responsibility. “He denies that the career system in the Police is no longer even valid, that even security checks are no longer valid,” he said. This is also the crux of the measures we are proposing in the interim report, Medved added.
That Kangler ""caught himself in a trap"" was further stated by Medved. According to him, Kangler did not remember or did not know at the hearing that in June 2020 he commented on Facebook on the content of the complaint, which was written in the Tonin case. ""It turned out that I should not have known about the content of this complaint, which should have been known only to the criminalist and the then head of the National Investigation Office."" In this way, according to the head of the commission of inquiry, he proved that he was interfering in the pre-trial proceedings, ""even more so by publicly commenting on them and even falsely presenting the content of the complaint"".
SDS Secretary Dejan Kaloh defended the State Secretary, saying that Kangler had explained many dilemmas and that he was hard-working, diligent, diligent and professional, and that his actions were legal. Social Democrat MP Matjaž Nemec said that it was inconceivable that Kangler would be an example to police officers with his actions and behavior.
On 10 January, the Commission adopted an interim report and a decision with a proposal from the National Assembly to call on Interior Minister Aleš Hojs to resign and to call on Prime Minister Janez Janša to inform the National Assembly. .
The interim report was unanimously supported by members of the opposition commission, while two members of the coalition were against. A separate opinion was given by a member of the commission of inquiry, SDS MP Dejan Kaloh, who rejected the findings of the commission of inquiry at the substantive level and assessed them as misleading and harmful."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/sarec-o-aktualnem-politicnem-dogajanju.html,Šarec on possible cooperation with Golob,"The president of the LMŠ, Marjan Šarec, explained at the press conference that there is a possibility of the LMŠ party cooperating with Robert Golob, but only if he agrees with the ten commitments set out in the KUL coalition agreement.","Marjan Šarec first explained that he had talked to Robert Golob, and described the meeting as very pleasant. Golob also confirmed to him that he would start partisan. They discussed the possibilities of co-operation, as they have a common goal that the current government will leave and that Slovenia will not get this government again after the new elections. What is written in the KUL agreement (ten commitments) is also important for LMŠ, so they can cooperate with those who agree with it.
It is also important that the new government will be really ready to deal with the corruption that has accumulated during this time, Šarec explained. Formally, they will be able to talk to Golob about cooperation only when he joins a party or forms his own. It is important for the KUL coalition that the party that would like to cooperate with them respects the ten commitments or values ​​they stand for. For them, the most important thing is to repeal all controversial laws that were adopted at that time, and to clear up corruption, he explained."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kitajska-tajvan.html,'We don't know what China's need will be to show that such behavior is unacceptable.',"What will be the consequences of Prime Minister Janša's statements? With them, he rocked the axis of the sensitive world superpower of China, which immediately not only burned, but also took action. Slovenian businessmen are already feeling the consequences, will the consequences also be political? And how should we put out the diplomatic and economic fire?","Prof. Marko Lovec understands Janša's move with FDV as a kind of provocation, which is risky not only from the point of view of Slovenia's economic situation and retaliatory measures, but also from the point of view that it could provoke aggravation of relations between Taiwan and China.
What will be the consequences of Janša's statements, not only economic, but also political? Slovenia is running as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, while China has the right to veto it. ""The question is how serious this candidacy is, whether it can be part of political action, self-awareness, pointing the finger at some countries and seeking support from Western countries that have certain views on Taiwan,"" Hunter said.
This is not the first time Janša has angered China. Is this Janša's party or personal agenda, or could there be a wider EU interest in the background? I don't know if Janša speaks on behalf of Europe, Slovenia has pursued a moderately constructive policy towards China for many years, Janša has sided with certain political forces in the United States with his views. ""Europe has much more moderate views and, on the other hand, no mechanisms to protect members from retaliation,"" he said. .
Janša's position on Taiwan could also be described as principled, in accordance with how the Slovenian state was formed. But in the case of Catalonia and Palestine, the position of the SDS is completely different, Janša even had the Israeli flag hung on the front of the government as a sign of solidarity with Israel. What do such different criteria mean for the credibility, not only of the Prime Minister, but also of the country he represents? Every situation is special, Hunter says. ""For China, the policy of one country is very important for China, part of a broader consensus, on the other hand, the other part of this system is a certain autonomy, and here China seems to be interfering in the other part of this agreement, as in Hong Kong. We can be right in many ways, but the question is how to effectively protect the interests of the autonomy of these individual parts and with such solo provocations we can not achieve this, we need a common approach, ""said Prof. Hunter.
Opposition to Janša accuses soloing. Does this mean that foreign policy is currently determined by Janša himself? We have already had several situations when we wondered on whose behalf the Prime Minister was speaking: ""Officially, of course, he represents the state and outside, mostly what he does, they understand as the state's position. there is a fear that other countries will try and that there will be an impression that this is allowed, and that for preventive reasons they will try to show with sanctions that anyone who dares to do something like that will face consequences. ""
Is it possible to put out this fire? ""We don't know what the scale of this fire will be. We don't know what China's need will be to show that such conduct is unacceptable,"" Hunter replies. As he points out, this also depends on the extent to which China will understand Jansa's statement as his personal position.
Has Slovenia waived the arbitration award?
The Slovenian government - in addition to the parliament - is currently conducting silent diplomacy with Croatia, which - according to unofficial information from the Croatian side - should lead to a common fishing area. Has Slovenia thus renounced the arbitration award in practice? According to Lovec, arbitration is a legal fact and any solution will not be possible: ""The question is to what extent arbitration is feasible in the Piran Bay and why it would be so important for us. This line runs along the sea, fish swim past it, in this sense, I think the agreement on joint management is good, but it needs to be upgraded. It is important that this is considered a natural geographical unit and that natural resources are protected, which is key capital. ""
The Slovenian government also sees no problems with Croatia's declaration of an economic zone, which permanently prevents Slovenia from accessing the high seas, on the contrary, Janša's government has become the main sponsor of Croatia's entry into Schengen. Good relations with Croatia are, of course, important: but isn't the price too high for Slovenia and its vital interests? The hunter replies, ""that the arbitration agreement did not give us ownership of the space to access international waters, but gave us a communication channel. I see no risk in economic zones. Attempts to condition Croatia's entry into Schengen have so far not borne fruit. ""There will be a lot of negative energy and costs. Now mobility will be easier, the problem of migration will be moved to the southern Croatian border. The spirit of the agreements is in favor of the majority of Slovenes.""
In a half-hour interview for Indian national television, Prime Minister Janša shook his nest. In the debate over whether Taiwan is an independent state or part of China, which has been going on for decades, Prime Minister Jansa strongly defended Taiwan, said he supported their secession from China and stressed the importance of cooperation with Taiwan. However, the authorities in China were deeply surprised, calling Janša's words dangerous and announcing some time ago that Taiwan's attempt to gain independence would mean war. Taiwan, home to about 23 million people, is officially recognized by 15 countries, but is not a member of the European Union. However, Taiwan has many representative offices."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/korona/avstrijski-parlament-izglasoval-obvezno-cepljenje.html,Austrian MEPs support compulsory vaccination against covid-19,"The Austrian parliament has given the green light to a bill by which the government intends to introduce compulsory vaccination against covid-19 for all adults in February. He was supported by a large majority, with 137 votes in favor, 33 against and 13 abstentions. This is the strictest European vaccination protocol - the only exceptions will be pregnant women and those who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons. Prior to the vote, a heated debate erupted in the parliamentary benches, and protesters gathered in Vienna. Tonight, parliament also adopted tougher penalties for violators, and inspectors will be able to close the company for the whole week.","Compulsory vaccination has had support within the ruling coalition between the People's Party and the Greens and among the opposition Social Democrats and Neos. The coalition was unanimous, reports the Austrian radio and television ORF. The Liberals strongly opposed the bill.
In order for the law to actually enter into force, it must be approved by the upper house of parliament or the Bundesrat, but the ruling parties have a majority there, adds the ORF. The vote is scheduled for February 3.
A heated debate
At the beginning of today's debate in the Austrian parliament, the leader of the Austrian Liberals (FPÖ), Herbert Kickl, said that he was appalled and shocked by the law introducing compulsory vaccination against covid-19. He also reminded the Austrian government ministers of the promise that there will be no general compulsory vaccination against covid-19. “It’s about stabbing to the heart of their credibility,” Kickl added. He added that the Austrian government wants to defeat the Chinese virus with the Chinese social model, the Austrian daily Kronen Zeitung reported on its website.
The leader of the Greens, Sigrid Maurer, addressed Kickl in response: ""Shame on you."" She added that freelancers are completely cynical, and that it is their policy that is to blame for the small share of those vaccinated.
Opposition Social Democrat chairwoman Pamela Rendi-Wagner emphasized the importance of today's sensitive decision in parliament: ""Many things have gone wrong in recent years and there have been many delays, so vaccinations are still too low,"" she said. compulsory vaccination against covid-19, which no one wanted, became necessary.
Neos President Beate Meinl-Reisinger said they were united by widespread fatigue, as the last few years have been extremely stressful, which is why, she said, it is important that we finally leave those times behind. She added that there should never again be restrictions on freedom, as has happened during past closures of public life.
Austrian Health Minister Wolfgang Mückstein has once again spoken out in parliament against false claims about vaccination itself and doubts about vaccines. ""All the evidence shows that all the preparations available in Austria are safe,"" the health minister said, according to the Austrian news agency APA. He reiterated that vaccination against covid-19 is safe, and a high rate of vaccination is needed to contain the virus. He added that counter-claims also serve divisions within society, making spreading false news dangerous. “I urge every citizen to question the myths about vaccination,” Mückstein added.
Announced voting obstructions in advance
According to the Kronen Zeitung, the Liberals achieved that today's vote for the law on compulsory vaccination against covid-19 took place by name. Green MP Ewa Ernst-Dziedzic has already announced in advance that she will not be voting because she does not want to vote for.
Some SPÖ MEPs have said they will not vote tonight due to illness. All freelance MPs are expected to vote against.
The events were accompanied by protests
The debate and vote in the Austrian parliament were also accompanied by protests by opponents of the covid-19 vaccination in central Vienna. The first protesters gathered near parliament this morning. According to Austrian collection law, outdoor rallies of 300 meters are prohibited during sessions of the Austrian Parliament or the Provincial Assembly.
Protesters carried banners criticizing anti-crown measures and compulsory vaccination, which was accompanied by loud use of flutes and drums. The number of protesters varies; there are hundreds to several thousand protesters. Among the protesters was the leader of the far-right Identitarians movement, Martin Sellner. There were no reports of major riots, as can be seen from the videos on social networks, but the protesters are still insisting on the streets of Vienna in the evening, and the police presence has been greatly strengthened.

Introduced stricter penalties for violators of anti-crown measures
Tonight, the Austrian parliament also adopted amendments to the law on anti-crown measures, which provides for tougher measures for those who do not comply with measures to curb infections with the new coronavirus.
By decision, individual administrative authorities will be able to close for a maximum of seven days those companies that have previously been punished three times for the same non-compliance (eg exceeding the limit of persons or failing to verify the relevant evidence). In individual cases, the company will be able to close immediately for seven days.
The changes also bring an increase in the maximum fines and the novelty that both labor inspectorates and other supervisory bodies are authorized under the Food Safety and Consumer Protection Act to monitor compliance with current anti-crown measures as part of their activities.
Austrian Tourism Minister Elisabeth Köstinger said in a statement that she was in favor of tightening up in this area. ""Any company that violates anti-crown measures must be punished,"" she said, adding that tougher penalties increase control pressure.
Up to 3,600 euros in fines
At present, about 72 percent of the population in Austria is fully vaccinated under the basic scheme. Mandatory vaccination would otherwise be introduced in three phases. In early February, each household will receive a written notification of the measure. This initial phase will last until March 14, and only then will compliance monitoring be triggered. From then on, the unvaccinated will have to count on a fine of 600 euros in the fast-track procedure and up to 3,600 euros in the regular procedure.
If the epidemiological situation so requires, a third phase may take effect, with a federal government decree setting a timeline for vaccination and then, with parliamentary approval, introducing automatic penalties for unvaccinated people across the country.
The Czech government is abolishing compulsory vaccination of the elderly and some occupational groups
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the new Czech government led by Peter Fiale abandoned the idea of ​​mandatory vaccination against covid-19 for the elderly and some occupational groups. The decree on this was adopted just before the end of his term by the previous government of Andrej Babiš, and Fiala said that there would be no compulsory vaccination in the country under his government.
The first minister of the five-party government - the Democratic Citizens 'Party (ODS), which also includes the prime minister, TOP 09, the Christian Democrats (KDU-ČSL), the Pirates and the Stan mayors' party) said he did not want to deepen the rift. in a society caused by the covida-19 epidemic.
""Although vaccination is the most effective tool against severe forms of covida-19, we do not want to force anyone into it,"" Health Minister Vlastimil Valek wrote on Twitter.
Compulsory vaccination for residents aged 60 and over should take effect on 1 March, as well as for some occupational groups - health professionals and staff in nursing homes, medical students, police officers, firefighters and soldiers.
The Czech Republic is also in the middle of a wave of coronavirus infections with omicron, as it is facing a large number of confirmed infections. In the country, 63 percent of people are vaccinated, and about 31 percent received a booster dose.
The new government therefore yesterday adopted a proposal for an updated law on the management of the covida-19 epidemic, which will replace the existing one. This expires at the end of February. With it, the government retains broad powers to limit or close down activities in the event of a deteriorating epidemiological situation."

Namely, companies cancel contracts and also withdraw from agreed investments.","
According to the Council of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia, chaired by Žiga Vavpotič, some companies have received cancellations of purchase contracts, some have announced the termination of physical or online sales of products, and some report that Chinese partners have withdrawn from already agreed business investments. .
Still other companies have followed the experience of Lithuania, where the dispute with China has severely tightened customs procedures with Asia's largest economy, and are trying to shift their operations across other EU countries.
""International cooperation is mostly about the stability of the business environment, and as soon as it shakes, the economy feels the consequences,"" the Slovenian-Chinese Business Council said.
Slovenia has 3.7 billion euros in trade with China, which is growing. Last year it was 3.5 percent higher than in 2019. More than three hundred companies cooperate with China both directly and indirectly.
Following numerous responses from Prime Minister Janša's statements on Taiwan, the council's executive committee stressed on Wednesday the importance of stable political relations for the business environment in both countries and for advancing economic exchange. They stressed that economic relations must remain non-politicized.
Today, they wrote that Slovenia is an export-oriented economy, and China is one of its largest partners outside the EU. At a time of economic recovery after the Crown crisis, there is nothing in the interest of the economy that makes economic co-operation more difficult, they said.
""Although our products and services are high quality and innovative, every change in political relations changes the dynamics of business. Therefore, as a country, we must ensure that political relations are stable, because only then can we expect a stable business environment,"" they added.
They also noted that the Chinese market is particularly specific, as enough time needs to be taken with Chinese partners to build trust. So they are worried that this trust will be shaken.
On Wednesday evening, the Minister of Economy and Deputy Prime Minister Zdravko Počivalšek also responded to the Prime Minister's statements regarding Taiwan. He also emphasized that China is one of Slovenia's largest economic partners outside the EU, adding that ""personal views, even if given with the best of intentions, must take into account the economic reality"". According to him, Slovenian foreign policy must have Slovenian economic interests in mind. Today, due to Janša's statements, representatives of the SD, LMŠ and SAB parliamentary groups submitted a request for an emergency meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee."

The reason: statements by Prime Minister Janez Janša regarding Slovenia's attitude towards Taiwan. Among other things, the three parties believe that Janša's statements could have long-term consequences for relations with Asian countries and that they are inconsistent with Slovenia's long-term foreign policy strategy. President Pahor agrees with them.","In response to Prime Minister Janez Janša's statements on Taiwan and China, President Borut Pahor pointed out that Slovenia has consistently defended the principle of one China since the establishment of diplomatic relations with China. He added that the European Union is also committed to this principle. ""Taipei has economic representations in 20 EU member states. The idea of ​​opening such a representative office in Slovenia is not new. The president sees it as a stimulus to economic relations,"" the president's office said. oz. announcements by Prime Minister Janša.
The president deliberately distinguished between Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, and Taiwan as a country. The EU member states have ""Taipei representations"", not Taiwan, which the People's Republic of China strongly opposes because it considers Taiwan part of its territory and opposes the island's independence.
Speaking to Indian television on Monday, the prime minister said that talks with Taiwan on ""exchanging representations"" were under way, saying ""this will not be at the level of embassies"". ""This will be a representation at the same level as many EU member states already have,"" he said. He sharply criticized China for responding to Lithuania's announcement of the opening of a diplomatic mission in Taiwan and Taiwan's in the Baltic states, and called Taiwan a state. However, the Foreign Ministry said only that the talks were underway and that it was supposed to establish an ""economic and cultural representation"". However, it is not clear how far they are.
At the Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday, Jansa's statements about Taiwan were described as ""dangerous"" and strongly opposed, saying Taiwan was an indivisible part of Chinese territory and the one-China principle was a universally recognized rule of international relations.
Urgent session of the OZP due to Janša's statements: 'Inadmissible soloing to the detriment of Slovenia'
Due to Janša's statements on China and Taiwan, three opposition parliamentary groups - SD, LMŠ and SAB - are calling for an extraordinary meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee (OZP). The reasons for this were discussed at a joint press conference.
As Matjaž Nemec (SD), who is also a member of the committee, said in the introduction, Janša's statements are inconsistent with the treaties that the Republic of Slovenia must respect. It is a strategic shift in relation to the second largest economic power in the world and an inconsistent policy at a time when Slovenian athletes are heading to Beijing for the Olympic Games. However, the German warns that the economic damage could be significant. Therefore, he says that it is important to discuss behind closed doors whether the strategic goals of the Republic of Slovenia have changed.
The German reminded that Slovenia had established channels of solidarity with China when the covida-19 pandemic broke out, and that China was one of the first countries to help Slovenia at a time when it was not possible to provide protection in Europe. with a pandemic.
He also noted that Slovenia is running as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, for which the support of African and Asian countries, where China has its influence, is also important. . He added that on the one hand it is inconsistency when Slovenia seeks support for a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, and on the other hand the search for conflict and opening new issues with another global power and another economic power in the world.
Andrej Rajh (SAB) said that it was ""inadmissible and arbitrary to isolate the particular interests of Janša's party to the detriment of Slovenia"". ""China is an important partner, so such a policy can be harmful, and a closed session is more than appropriate,"" he said. According to him, Slovenia under the current government is becoming ""a child of Pobalin, who isolates and adheres to those about whom no one has asked for his opinion. Such a policy is harmful and represents a continuation of the harmful policy we have seen by the current Prime Minister in during the US election campaign "".
The LMŠ also signed the emergency session. Nik Prebil emphasized that the relations with the world power were being tightened unnecessarily and that the statement had passed the National Assembly. He added that the National Assembly is the one that shapes, changes and adopts the entire foreign policy of Slovenia, and pointed out that the recent Prime Minister's statements on the establishment of missions with Taiwan have passed the National Assembly. He added that today there was a discrepancy between the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as the latter informs the public that it is supposed to be an economic or cultural representation.
In an interview with Indian television Doordarshan, Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša revealed, among other things, that talks were being held with Taiwan on the exchange of missions. At the same time, he was very critical of China for reacting sharply to Lithuania’s decision to open its diplomatic mission in Taipei and allow Taiwanese in Vilnius.
Official Beijing also reacted sharply to his statements. Jansa's statements about Taiwan were described as dangerous. ""Taiwan is an indivisible part of Chinese territory. The Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the whole of China. Zhao Lijiang."

Politico writes that this is a move that will only help aggravate the situation in the conflict between Lithuania and China.","As Matjaž Nemec explained to us, the request to convene an extraordinary meeting of the Foreign Policy Committee is still in the preparation phase, they are still communicating with the opposition, and they will probably make an official statement tomorrow. The meeting will be closed to the public. In this case, it is the personal position of Janez Janša, not the Republic of Slovenia, according to Nemec. His statements could harm Slovenia's interests, as such actions have an impact on economic cooperation, the German added.
Janša responded: ""The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China is requesting an extraordinary session through its branches in #KUL @strankaSD. Because Slovenia should not cooperate economically with Taiwan, even though it has been doing so for a long time and most EU and OECD offices are ""he wrote.
Today, Janša also responded to criticism from MEP Milan Brglez (S&D / SD), who wrote on Tuesday that the prime minister's statements were a ""rude and crazy privatization of foreign policy"". ""The Prime Minister is whistling at the Foreign Affairs Act and the National Assembly, while he will quarrel with us with at least two superpowers,"" Brglez wrote.
In today's response, Janša wrote that the vast majority of EU member states have economic representations in Taiwan and vice versa. ""Only the proud successors of the dictatorship in the SD party can oppose Slovenia's equal and sovereign European policy and agree to second-class status. Because their role models are in power in China.""
In a statement for the media, MP Nik Prebil (LMŠ) expressed indignation over such statements by the Prime Minister, which cast a bad light on Slovenia and aggravate relations with China.
Regarding the possible consequences, he mentioned both economic and political companies in the light of China-related companies and highlighted China's sharp response. ""By doing so, the prime minister is just showing that he is a provocateur, a populist and anything but a statesman,"" he said.
He described as a dangerous precedent that Janša bypassed the National Assembly, where all foreign policy has been coordinated so far. ""Appropriate discussion at the level of the National Assembly and explanations from the government will be needed,"" he added.
Resting on Janša's statements about Taiwan: Personal views must take into account the economic reality
Prime Minister and Economy Deputy Prime Minister Zdravko Počivalšek responded to Prime Minister Janez Janša's recent statements regarding Taiwan. China is one of Slovenia's largest economic partners outside the EU, he wrote, adding that ""personal views, even if given with the best intentions, must take into account the economic reality"".
""Slovenia is strong only insofar as it is economically successful. Despite the pandemic, we have strengthened the economy, especially exports, which shows our correct approach. China is one of Slovenia's largest non-EU economic partners. 1, this cooperation is being further strengthened, ""he concluded.
According to him, our foreign policy must therefore have Slovenia's economic interests in mind. “Personal views, even if given with the best of intentions, must take into account economic realities,” he added.
A sharp response from official Beijing
After the Taiwanese Foreign Ministry expressed gratitude to Janša on Twitter yesterday for ""strong support"", the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a response today that it strongly opposes the Slovenian Prime Minister's announcements about an ""exchange of missions"" with Taiwan.
Jansa's statements about Taiwan were described as ""dangerous"". ""Taiwan is an integral part of Chinese territory. The Government of the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government representing the whole of China. The one-China principle is a universally recognized rule of international relations and a universal consensus of the international community,"" a Chinese Ministry of Zhao Lijiang.
""This is also the political foundation of relations between China and Slovenia and China and Europe,"" he added, according to the Chinese English-language web portal CGTN.
Politico also writes about Janša's statements. ""This is a move that will further escalate tensions in the dispute between Lithuania and China over the Taiwanese mission,"" the article said, ""Slovenia will strengthen trade ties with Taiwan and 'quarrel' with China.""
The article recalled Jansa's statements in an interview with Indian television Doordarshan, in which he revealed that ""we are striving to exchange missions"" and at the same time stated that ""this will not be at the level of embassies"". ""This will be at the level of missions, as many EU member states already have,"" Janša said.
He said that Slovenia would support any sovereign decision of the Taiwanese, regardless of whether they want to live independently or ""freely, without coercion, military intervention, blackmail or strategic fraud, as is currently happening in Hong Kong, decide to we would like to be part of China "".
He sharply criticized China for reacting to Lithuania's announcement of the opening of a Lithuanian mission in Taiwan and a Taiwanese mission in Lithuania.
""Officially, the EU has supported Lithuania, and I don't think further pressure on Lithuania and some other countries in Europe will benefit the Chinese government. Good trade relations are in the common interest. If one side tries to harm those relations, it could but we are all losers, ""he said.
Among other things, he noted the responsibility for the outbreak of the covida-19 pandemic, which ""remains to be discussed"" and said that ""the Chinese authorities should be held accountable"" for failing to inform the world in time about the threat of a new coronavirus.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/svet-bi-se-moral-zdruziti-proti-putinu.html,'The world should unite against Putin',"This is the assessment of former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko for the American CNN. It comes after Russia continues to amass forces on the Ukrainian border and threatens to take action, indicating an invasion if not everyone bows to ""its interests."" Although the history of relations between Russia and Ukraine is complicated, the current situation is essentially simple - rattling with weapons on the border of an independent state is unacceptable. And countries that are considering supporting Moscow in the light of their own interests should first consider the long-term consequences for other “potential hotspots” if Russian behavior becomes acceptable.","Poroshenko also stressed that Ukraine should be allowed to join NATO. The billionaire led Ukraine from 2014 to 2019, taking power soon after Russia invaded and then annexed Crimea. He was then defeated in the 2019 presidential election by incumbent President Volodimir Zelenski. ""It is absolutely essential that there be international solidarity and unity against Vladimir Putin,"" Poroshenko said, warning Western leaders that the Russian leader should not be trusted.
He also called for an increase in international sanctions against Russia: ""We need to make Russia weaker, and we can do that with sanctions. We should make Ukraine stronger.""
What is going on in Vladimir Putin's head in the meantime, no one knows. Poroshenko even believes that the Russian leader himself does not yet know whether the Russian invasion will actually happen. However, he called it a ""crazy decision"" and said the international community should ""significantly increase the price Putin would have to pay if Russian forces cross the Ukrainian border"".
There is no shortage of calls to calm the passion. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also spoke, inviting Russian and Ukrainian presidents to Turkey to ""resolve disagreements"" between the two countries.
But of course it is not so simple. Tensions are also tied to what is happening on the domestic political stage of both countries. Ukraine is struggling with poverty and corruption, Russia is having economic problems.
Economists predict that in 2022 the Russian economy will return to its pre-crown pattern of slow growth, weak investment and too low a standard of living. ""While other countries have used the pandemic to reshape their economic policies, launch ambitious investment projects or accelerate the green transition, Russia's approach has been to return to normal business as soon as possible, seeing the effects of the coronavirus as a confirmation of its growth stability model. This means strong public finances and even more withdrawal from the global economy, resulting in lower growth and further pressure on households, ”the Moscow Times recently reported.
The list of problems of Russian problems - with the announced tightening of the belt - is long. It includes poor demographics, structural economic bottlenecks, a lack of far-reaching reform to diversify from the dominant role of the oil and gas sector in the economy, weak governance, high vulnerability to geopolitical change, outdated infrastructure, high income inequality and inefficient social network. which is further cited by the medium.
Thus, it is quite possible that Moscow's recourse to the old tactic of searching for an external enemy is to blame for warming the atmosphere, as this is usually effective in calming internal dissatisfaction, which is expected to grow.
Regardless of Russian motives, the rest of the world has the task of responding to Russian attempts to destabilize the area. Although limited resources are available, no one wants to get involved in a real war, and Putin has already learned in the case of Crimea that something particularly bad will not happen to him.
""We want to calm the passion,"" said US diplomatic sources, who point out that US diplomacy is even more active in this area these days. If there is no appeasement of passion, Moscow will face sanctions. “We are ready to go further than before,” the source points out. This time, sanctions are expected to hit Russia harder than it has in the past. While the details are not yet known, it can be assumed that there are a wider range of sanctions that would hit the economy harder than in the past, when measures were limited mainly to Putin's inner circle.
But the timeline for resolving the complication is unknown. The source says NATO is ""ready to wait"" - but not indefinitely.
There is also a strong awareness that Russia is also trying to achieve in the international arena that its interpretation of what is happening in which Russia is a victim and NATO is an evil figure prevails. Therefore, Russia is again expected to spread disinformation, which can be an extremely effective weapon, as through the internationally diversified regime media apparatus, false information and half-truths find their way not only to social networks but also to established media.
The source further emphasizes that the United States is determined - along with its allies - to stop Russian appetites, as rattling with weapons on the border of an independent state is unacceptable. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense estimates that almost 130,000 Russian troops are already present in the region, and this is of course not a coincidence, but a message.
The Allies are said to be united in their positions, although there are speculations about Germany's role, as foreign policy collides with economic interests. And while part of German politics, now part of the new government, said before the election that the focus of the country's future foreign policy would be on what is right and not so much on what is profitable, many doubt the country wants a big dispute. with Putin, who recently said he could start supplying large quantities of cheap gas - in the midst of an energy crisis.
These days, the new German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has been trying to calm down Ukraine's concerns that the country will not compromise on the fundamental principles of Ukraine's territorial sovereignty. Baerbock said she was ready for a serious dialogue with Russia on mutual security, but was unwilling to abandon ""basic principles such as territorial integrity, free choice of alliances and the renunciation of threats of violence"". ""Any further aggressive act will have a high price for Russia, economically, strategically, politically,"" she said, stressing that diplomacy is the only way.
However, the issue of territorial sovereignty is the one that should not leave any doubt on how to act, according to an American source. Countries that are considering supporting Moscow in the light of their own interests should first consider the long-term consequences for other ""potential hotspots"" if Russian behavior becomes acceptable. In other words, if Putin enforces his will on the Ukrainian border, who - and with what authority - will prevent similar tendencies elsewhere?
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrived in Ukraine today to meet with European allies in Berlin and his Russian counterpart in Geneva.
Russia has repeatedly denied planning an invasion of neighboring Ukraine, but has made a number of demands to Western governments, including that Ukraine never join NATO and that the Alliance's military activities should be limited.
Talks between the West and Russia last week did not bring a breakthrough, and some of Moscow's demands have already been rejected.
In an essay published Monday, however, UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace accused Russia of using NATO to justify the invasion of Ukraine, and accused Putin of being motivated by ""ethnonationalism"".
We must all worry because President Putin himself is writing an essay of 7,000 words that puts ethnonationalism at the heart of his ambitions. it completely ignores the wishes of the citizens of Ukraine, while at the same time arousing the same kind of ethnonationalism that has emerged across Europe for centuries and can still awaken the same destructive forces of ancient hatred, ""he said. with ""malicious activity of the Kremlin""."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/evropski-parlament-odloca-o-novem-predsedniku.html,"Roberta Metsola, new President of the European Parliament",Roberto Metsolo of the European People's Party (EPP) has been elected the new President of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. She became the third woman to hold the post and the youngest speaker of parliament to date.,"An absolute majority was required for election in the first round of voting. Roberta Metsola received 458 votes out of 616 valid ballots cast. Her election was accompanied by loud applause from the deputies. The president, who will lead the parliament in the second half of her term, is celebrating her 43rd birthday today.
Metsola has secured the support of the three largest political groups in the European Parliament, in addition to its EPP, the Socialists (S&D) and the Liberals (Renew). After the election, she first remembered the late President David Sassoli a week ago and announced that she would continue his work. Already in the presentation before the vote, she said that Sassoli wanted to have everything at the table, and she will strive for that herself. ""I would like to strengthen the culture of dialogue, politics should not be a struggle between winners and losers, but should be in the service of citizens,"" she said.
Among the priorities for the future, she highlighted the green agreement and economic recovery after the pandemic. She emphasized the need to combat false information and strengthen solidarity in Europe. ""Those who want to undermine democracy, the rule of law, freedom of speech and fundamental rights, those who see women as targets and deny LGBTIQ rights, know that our house will never accept this,"" she said in a post-election speech.
Metsola, a mother of four, has been criticized for her stance on the right to abortion. It is banned in Malta, where it comes from, and Metsola last year did not support the European Parliament's resolution that all women should be guaranteed the right to terminate their pregnancies.
Garcia Perez, the leader of the S&D group Iratxe, reminded her that she would have to defend the majority positions of the parliament as president, while Stepahne Sejourne from Renew expressed her expectation that she would support the Simone Veil pact, which guarantees women's rights. The French politician Veilova, who was the first woman to lead the parliament between 1979 and 1982, was known for her efforts for women's rights, including the right to abortion.
Congratulating Metsoli, EPP leader Manfred Weber reminded that the new president comes from a small country, and her election proves that small countries in the EU also mean something.
In addition to Metsola, Alice Bah Kuhnke of the Greens and Sira Rego of the Left also ran for president, while Kosma Zlotowski of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) withdrew her candidacy.
Socialist Sassoli's term would expire this month. His election in July 2019 was the result of an agreement between the three largest political groups to hold the presidency in the second half of his term. The three largest groups also agreed to co-operate for the second half of their term. Priorities include preserving European values ​​and the rule of law, climate, health, digitalisation and economic recovery. ""While the extremists are talking, we are concretely working for the citizens,"" the Renew group wrote on Twitter on Monday.
Metsoli congratulations also from Slovenia
President Pahor wrote on Twitter that he congratulated Metsoli on her election and wished her successful work. Prime Minister Janša wrote that he warmly congratulated the new Speaker of Parliament.
The Speaker of the National Assembly Zorčič tweeted that he sincerely congratulated her. ""I believe she will be successful in her work and I hope for enhanced inter-parliamentary cooperation,"" he added.
Slovenian MEPs also responded to the election of the new President of the European Parliament, Metsola. At her election, MEP Franc Bogovič (SLS / EPP) emphasized that she was a young but at the same time very experienced politician and longtime MP. ""She is a determined and enthusiastic advocate of the European Union and democracy and a dedicated and competent Member of Parliament who always listens to the people. Given her openness and very cohesive stance, I believe she will be an excellent president of all,"" he wrote.
Ljudmila Novak also joined the congratulations, adding that Metsola had already proved to be a good vice-president of the European House of Democracy in the first half of her term. ""Her vision of a democratic and united EU will be extremely important,"" Novakova said.
After the election of the new president, MEPs Irena Joveva and Klemen Grošelj (Renew / LMŠ) said that it was the result of a political agreement between the three largest pro-European political groups on cooperation until the end of the current parliamentary term. Although they are pleased to be back at the helm of Parliament after many years, they expect the new President to overcome the personal and political will to credibly and decisively represent the European Parliament, especially on issues on which she has different personal or ideological views. As they added, they expect ""President Metsola to continue on the path of the late President David Sassoli""."

According to unfinished data, 61.8 percent of voters voted for the changes, while 37.1 percent were against.","According to the Serbian news agency Tanjug, Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić said that Serbia had sent a positive image to the world. “We did a good thing for the state,” he said.
The President of the Serbian National Assembly, Ivica Dačić, also welcomed the results of the referendum. He said he was satisfied with the turnout, which according to provisional figures was around 30 per cent. According to him, a successful referendum will bring better justice, faster adoption of reforms and Serbia's progress on the path to European integration, the Serbian public radio and television RTS reports online.
Amendments to the constitution, approved by citizens, were also welcomed by the Serbian Judges' Association. In their view, this has made it possible to establish a better institutional framework for the judiciary and the prosecutor's office.
EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver Varhelyi, meanwhile, emphasized that the confirmation of the changes represents an important step and Serbia's commitment to the European path. He called for further cooperation with the Serbian authorities on reforms in order to make progress on the path to the EU.
In Sunday's referendum, Serbian voters answered the question of whether they were in favor of approving the act amending the constitution. These are constitutional amendments adopted by parliament last November concerning the appointment of judges and prosecutors.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/vucic-srbija-se-avstralskim-sportnikom-ne-bo-mascevala.html,Vučić: Serbia will not take revenge on Australian athletes,"The Serbian public accepted the expulsion of their tennis ace Novak Djokovic from Australia with indignation. Virtually everyone agrees that politics has beaten the sport, they are convinced that the best tennis player in the world has been wronged. However, President Aleksandar Vučić claims that Serbia will make the decision with dignity and will not take revenge on Australian athletes.","""We will not take revenge, the Australian nation is not to blame. The nation has shown that it is with us, politics has not been. Australian athletes will soon come to us for the athletics championships and we will welcome them with open arms. We will behave completely differently than they go to Djokovic, ""said Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who also had a telephone conversation with the tennis player a year ago.
He said that Djokovic was eagerly awaited at home. ""He can come back upright, he's a hero to us. Those who think they've banished some principles have proved they don't have them at all. They harassed a tennis player for ten days to finally tell him what they've been up to since the beginning It would have been no problem if he had been told at the outset that he would not be allowed to enter the country as an unvaccinated person, but then they remembered the medical exceptions that allowed some to get a visa. , as it should have been, but he still has to go home, ""Vučić is indignant.
While Vučić is not planning retaliatory measures, the opposition is demanding them. The NADA coalition is demanding that the Australian ambassador be declared an undesirable person, as it is supposed to be the persecution of Australian politicians who are against Serbs and Serbia.
""Not only have they done irreparable damage to the best player, they have humiliated Serbia and all its citizens. We must therefore respond sharply to the arrogant behavior of the Australian authorities. Our ambassador must leave Australia and be declared an undesirable person here,"" the President.
Support for Đoković has already been expressed by the Minister of Sports Vanja Udovičić, the domestic tennis association, many other athletes and also politicians. ""The decision to expel Djokovic is scandalous and has shown how the rule of law works or does not work in some other countries,"" said Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic."
https://www.24ur.com/sport/ostalo/novak-dokovic-odlocitev.html,"Đoković case: Judges rejected the appeal, Novak on his way home","The hearing in the Novak Djokovic case has ended. The three judges decided to confirm the move of the competent minister Alex Hawk, who revoked the Serb's visa. The final decision was announced on Sunday morning. The Serb had to leave Australia and is already on a plane to Dubai, and he will also have to pay compensation to the state. His lawyers have hinted that they will not appeal the latest decision, which Djokovic has already confirmed in a press release.","
Referees James Allsop, Anthony Besanko and David O’Callaghan have decided whether Djokovic, the world’s number one tennis player, will be able to defend his title at the Australian Open. The decisions of the competent minister Alex Hawk have not been annulled and Novak Đoković will not be allowed to play in this year's Australian Open. His lawyers have not yet been able to assure the judges that they will not appeal their decision, but they have hinted that they are unlikely to.
Djokovic will have to go to the airport and fly out of the country. The Age newspaper reported that he would leave the country with a regular flight at 12.30 Slovenian time. So it happened, he flew from Melbourne to Dubai, then he will continue his journey home. When he will be able to return to Australia is a big question, as he faces a three-year ban from entering the country upon deportation. In addition, he will have to pay compensation to Australia.
Djokovic was at Melbourne airport, waiting to leave for Dubai:
Before reading the decision, Judge Allsop explained that the hearing was not intended to assess whether the minister's decision was correct, but the judges had to decide whether the revocation of the visa was unjustified and consequently illegal. The judges apparently believe he was not.
The Australian Tennis Federation has also already announced who will replace the Serb in the draw for the Australian Open. This will be the 150th player in the ATP world rankings, Salvatore Caruso, who will play in the first round against Djokovic's compatriot Miomir Kecmanovic.
Đoković and Hawke were quick to respond. Novak Đoković was quick to respond: ""I am very disappointed with the court's decision rejecting my appeal against the minister's decision. This means that I will not be allowed to run for the Australian Open. I respect the court's decision authorities regarding my departure from the country.I am unhappy that all the attention has been focused on me these days.I hope we can all now focus on tennis and the tournament I love.I want players, staff, volunteers and fans all the best in the tournament. In the end, I would like to thank my family, friends, team, supporters, fans and compatriots for their support. You have all been a great source of strength for me. I will now take time to rest and recover. "" His public relations representatives confirmed that the Serb will not be available for further statements until the end of the Australian Open.
Alex Hawke said: ""I am pleased with today's court ruling. Australia's strict border protection policy protected us during the pandemic, which contributed to one of the world's lowest mortality rates, the fastest economic recovery and the highest vaccination rate. A strict border protection policy is also fundamental. to safeguard Australia’s social cohesion, which continues to grow despite the pandemic.
The Australians have sacrificed a lot to get to this point, and the Morrison government is firmly committed to protecting this position, which is what the Australians expect. To date, approximately 43 million Australians have been vaccinated. More than 91.6% of Australians over the age of 16 are fully vaccinated. As a result, Australia has been able to gradually and securely open its international borders. This is the result of a successful vaccination program. ""
Prime Minister Morrison also spoke
The Australian Prime Minister commented on the court's decision: ""This decision to revoke the visa was made for health, safety and order and in the public interest. I am pleased with the decision that keeps our borders strong and protects Australians.""
""I thank the court for his immediate attention and all those involved for their patience. Now is the time to continue the Australian Open and enjoy tennis in the summer.""
Djokovic's defense
Chief Justice Allsop began the hearing by explaining why he decided to have as many as three judges present. This was helped by the fact that Đoković, if the visa revocation had been confirmed, would not have had enough time to appeal again before the start of the Australian Open, so the court's decision must be final. Prior to the speech, Allsop asked Djokovic's lawyer for the most efficient way of communication and expressed the wish that the hearing be concluded before the lunch break. This did not happen later, as the lawyers' speeches continued even after the break.
Djokovic's lawyer Nicholas Wood began his defense by claiming that Minister Hawke did not take into account the medical evidence provided by Djokovic in the decision. According to Wood, Hawke cited the government's assumption that Serbs are generally against vaccination as the main reason for the abolition of visas. Wood then claimed that they did not have enough evidence for such a claim. He also hinted that the only reason Djokovic's arrival in Australia mobilized opponents of vaccination was the government's decision to detain and try to deport the Serb. According to him, the actions of the government motivated groups that are against healing. He said that this motivation would not have been present if Djokovic had simply been allowed to perform at the Australian Open.
The government denies any hint of defense
Government attorney Stephen Lloyd denied all allegations by Djokovic's attorney. He added that the Minister does not need direct evidence to make a decision, but can use other cases and data to do so. He then said that the minister understands why Djokovic did not get vaccinated after the infection in mid-December last year, but that fact could not have influenced his decision not to get vaccinated before the infection.
The government's lawyer hinted that Đoković had not provided any objective reason other than the infection for the decision not to vaccinate. In his opinion, the fact that Đoković has not yet been vaccinated is in itself proof that the Serb is in principle against vaccination. According to Lloyd, Djokovic's opposition to vaccines even before the epidemic only confirms that his opinion on vaccination will not change in the near future.
After concluding the speeches of both lawyers, Chief Justice Allsop said that the judges will need the rest of the afternoon and possibly the evening after Australian time (Sunday morning after our time) to make a decision. He also hinted that the decision may not be made today after their time, but only tomorrow. In that case, the public would hear their decision in the late Sunday after our time or even on Monday morning.
Novak Đoković contacted Australian tennis player Thanasi Kokkinakis, who won his first career tournament in Adelaide after numerous injuries in recent years, during an Instagram interview. Djokovic told him in a private message on Instagram: ""Thanasi, congratulations on winning your first tournament in your hometown. I believe winning after all the injury problems is even sweeter. You deserve it! Great for tennis, good luck in Melbourne.""

V hospitalni oskrbi imajo skoraj tri četrtine mladostnikov diagnozo 'razvijajoča se osebnostna motnja', ker se v razvoju njihove identitete pojavljajo različne motnje in zaostanki,"" poudarja strokovnjakinja. Te trdovratne osebnostne motnje pa so posledica družbenih sprememb.
""Celotna družbena konstelacija za otroke in mladostnike ni prav spodbudna""
Otroci in mladostniki so poleg starejših največja žrtev te epidemije, poudarja sogovornica: ""Onemogočeno jim je opravljati razvojne naloge, ki pa jih lahko opravljajo le, ko so otroci oziroma najstniki. Zdaj pa v novo leto vstopajo z veliko mero anksioznosti, tudi zato, ker ne vedo, kako bo potekalo šolanje, kako bo s prostočasnimi aktivnostmi, krožki, druženjem. Številni so v karanteni, kar pomeni, da se pravzaprav spet šolajo na daljavo, in prav ta nestanovitnost slabša duševno zdravje otrok, mladostnikov in seveda tudi odraslih.""
Ko govorimo o učinkih epidemije, se seveda pojavi vprašanje, kako dolgoročni bodo oziroma kako se bodo odražali, ko bodo ti otroci in mladostniki odrasli. Strokovnjakinja poudarja, da nekega splošnega zaključka o tem preprosto ni mogoče podati,  kajti vsak otrok oziroma mladostnik je drugačen. Gre za čas razvoja, ko se osebnost šele gradi, zori in se spreminja. ""Veliko je odvisno od tega, kakšne osebnostne lastnosti ima ta otrok, kakšen temperament ima, kako prilagodljiv je. Zelo pomembno pa je tudi, kakšni so starši, kako se oni prilagajajo na to kritično situacijo – torej ali iz nje delajo veliko katastrofo ter svoje stiske in probleme, ki so nedvomno realni, delijo z otrokom ali mladostnikom in ga s tem še dodatno spravljajo v stisko ali pa morda ravnajo ravno nasprotno in mu povedo, da smo kot družba pred izzivom, ki ga bomo s skupnimi močmi verjetno lahko premagali.""
Poleg otroka in staršev so seveda pomemben dejavnik tudi šola in sošolci, kajti za mladostnike je mnenje njihovih vrstnikov zelo pomembno: ""Ali torej velja med njimi prepričanje, da se dogaja katastrofa ali vlada optimizem, da bo situacijo mogoče prebroditi."" 
Zanemariti pa ne gre niti vpliva celotne družbe, a kot poudarja strokovnjakinja, ta za otroke in mladostnike trenutno ni prav spodbudna, saj smo izjemno polarizirani ""Pravzaprav celotna družbena konstelacija za otroke in mladostnike ni prav spodbudna. Otroci in mladostniki, pri katerih se bodo vsi ti faktorji sešteli v 'minus', bodo po epidemiji slabše opremljeni – morda z nekaj neopravljenimi razvojnimi nalogami – kakor če epidemije ne bi bilo. Seveda bo večina kljub epidemiji ostala zdrava, ampak če jih v času epidemije samo nekaj odstotkov razvije nove duševne motnje, ki jih brez epidemije ne bi imeli, nas mora to skrbeti.""
Alarmantne številke
O vplivih epidemije na duševno zdravje se govori že od njenega začetka. A podatki, ki so s tem povezani, so več kot skrb vzbujajoči – tudi zaradi dejstva, da so kapacitete strokovne pomoči pri nas omejene: ""Situacija je zelo kritična, število otrok in mladostnikov, ki potrebujejo pomoč na področju duševnega zdravja, se je izrazito povečalo. Če govorimo o anksioznih stanjih, depresivnih stanjih in motnjah hranjenja, gre za tudi okoli 40-odstotno povečanje. Zelo se je povečala tudi prisotnost samomorilnih misli pri mladostnikih, tako da se pedopsihiatri soočamo z velikim pritiskom.""
 V Sloveniji imamo tri centre, ki izvajajo urgentno dejavnost na področju duševnega zdravja otrok in mladostnikov in so priključeni bolnišničnim oddelkom otroške in mladostniške psihiatrije – dva v Ljubljani in enega v Mariboru. ""Soočamo se s številkami, ki so videti kot tiskarska napaka. In če boste pisali številke, jih napišite z besedo. Od dvesto pa do tristo šestdeset odstotkov več urgentnih napotitev imamo, kot smo jih imeli pred epidemijo,"" poudarja Gregorič Kumperščakova. 
 ""Vse to pa pokrivamo praktično z istim kadrom in prostori kot pred epidemijo, kar je seveda nevzdržno,"" dodaja. Poudari, da so jim v veliko pomoč specializanti. ""Toda zaradi trenutne situacije se v tem trenutku v veliki meri soočajo samo z urgentno pedopsihiatrijo, saj zmanjkuje časa, da bi jih učili 'normalne pedopsihiatrije'. Tako da so vse to slabe rešitve, na katere ne moremo biti ponosni in ki morajo biti samo začasne."" 
Prostih bolnišničnih postelj za otroke in mladostnike, ki potrebujejo psihiatrično pomoč, pravzaprav ni. ""Vsi štirje bolnišnični oddelki v Sloveniji – trije v Ljubljani in eden v Mariboru – imajo neprestano polno zasedene oziroma 120- ali 130-odstotno zasedene postelje. Soočamo se s takšnim pretokom pacientov, da ob deseti uri enega odpustimo, čez 30 minut pa je na postelji že drugi. Žal imamo čakalne dobe tudi za paciente, ki bi morali biti sprejeti urgentno, a jih zaradi prostorske in kadrovske stiske nimamo kam namestiti.""
Nemogoče si je zatiskati oči pred dejstvom, da vse skupaj – kljub trudu osebja – povzroča tudi slabšo oskrbo pacientov. Dovolj je pogled na podatke o ležalnih dobah. ""V Enoti za otroško in mladostniško psihiatrijo, kjer delam, smo imeli v času pred covidom povprečno ležalno dobo okoli 22 dni. Nekateri mladostniki, denimo z motnjami hranjenja, so bili hospitalizirani tudi po šest mesecev, nekateri z akutnimi stiskami pa kakšen teden. Skratka, povprečno 22 dni. Ko smo gledali podatke za januar 2021, se je povprečna ležalna doba skrajšala na pet dni, kar je katastrofalno. V petih dneh ne moreš v otroški in mladostniški pedopsihiatriji niti postaviti diagnoze, saj je diagnostika zelo obsežna. Pogovarjati se je treba s starši in šolo, opraviti kliničnopsihološka testiranja, ki vzamejo čas. Tudi učinek terapije, ki jo uvajamo, je običajno viden šele čez nekaj tednov.""  Oktobra 2021 je bila ležalna doba dvanajst dni, a tudi to je še vedno veliko manj kot v predkoronskem obdobju. 
Pomanjkanje kadra na vseh nivojih, tudi v 25 novih centrih. Pazite se ""vojnih dobičkarjev""
Kot poudarja, so sicer z ministrstvom za zdravje naredili načrt, kako bi se lahko hospitalne kapacitete nekoliko povečale. ""Univerzitetna psihiatrična klinika v Ljubljani je dobila deset novih postelj v prostorih, ki so jih preuredili. Je pa dejstvo, da so to samo prostori, ni pa kadra. Ni ne pedopsihiatrov, ne kliničnih psihologov, ne medicinskih sester, kar pomeni, da te postelje v resnici niso funkcionalne. V Mariboru smo hospitalne kapacitete povečali za 30 odstotkov. Izpraznili smo timsko sobo, kjer smo običajno imeli pogovore starši, CSD-ji in šolo, ter tja postavili tri postelje, ker je prostor dovolj velik. Seveda pa nismo dobili novega pedopsihiatra, tako da je stanje resnično kritično.""
 
Težave so tudi na primarnem nivoju. ""Pedopsihiatri v zdravstvenih domovih in centrih za duševno zdravje otrok in mladostnikov so polno zasedeni, tudi tam se daljšajo čakalne dobe, tako da smo vsi soočeni z res velikim porastom števila otrok in mladostnikov, ki potrebujejo pomoč. Ni pa to slovenska posebnost, s temi izzivi se soočajo tudi vse druge evropske države.""
""Na nivoju regij se je sicer v skladu z Resolucijo o nacionalnem programu duševnega zdravja, sprejeto pred časom, vzpostavilo 25 novih centrov za duševno zdravje otrok in mladostnikov, kar je seveda dobra novica, a se tudi tam soočajo s kadrovskim primanjkljajem. Premalo je predvsem pedopsihiatrov in kliničnih psihologov. Ko pa bodo ti centri polno zaživeli – in s kadrom, kot je navedeno v predlogu – torej ko bo imel vsak center pedopsihiatra ter določeno število kliničnih psihologov in ostalih članov tima, pa se bodo razmere verjetno vendarle nekoliko normalizirale,"" dodaja Gregorič Kumperščakova. 
Toda številni pomoč potrebujejo zdaj. Poročila o čakalnih dobah ter pomanjkanju kapacitet in kadra jih strašijo, številni, ki bi zase ali za svojce potrebovali pomoč, jo iščejo tudi v oglasih, še posebej na družbenih omrežjih. A vsaka ""vojna"" ima vojne dobičkarje in vojna s covidom-19 ni nič drugačna. Poplava ljudi, ki ponujajo takšne ali drugačne oblike pomoči, je razvidna, takoj ko obiščete kakšno družbeno omrežje. Kako se znajti v tem kaosu, zlasti če iščete pomoč za otroka? ""Kot rečeno, imamo v Sloveniji 25 centrov za duševno zdravje otrok in mladostnikov, ki so opremljeni s kadri, kot so socialni delavec, specialni pedagog, delovni terapevt, psiholog, nekateri imajo tudi pedopsihiatra. Tako da je najboljše, da se starši najprej obrnejo na te centre in morda tam tudi povprašajo, ali ti centri priporočajo še koga drugega. To naj bo torej torej prvi stik za informacije. Tudi na spletni strani NIJZ (Za duševno zdravje – Mira) najdejo vire pomoči in na spletni strani Združenja za otroško in mladostniško psihiatrijo. Pri iskanju pomoči zunaj tega okvira pa je nujno preveriti, kakšno formalno znanje in kakšne licence imajo ljudje, ki ponujajo pomoč. Kolikor sama poznam situacijo, pogosto nimajo licenc za delo z otroki in mladostniki. Prav tako se je dobro pozanimati pri kom, ki je z otrokom že bil pri tem ponudniku pomoči.""
Dva ekstrema: prepozno po pomoč in ""psihiatrizacija družbe""
Kako hitro pa pri nas poiščemo pomoč ob težavah z duševnim zdravjem? Zelo pozno, morda zelo hitro? ""Pri nas pokrivamo urgentna, težka stanja, ki potrebujejo hospitalizacijo. Pravzaprav vidimo oba ekstrema. Po eni strani pridejo mnogi prepozno, denimo z že tako nizko telesno težo, ko gre za motnje hranjenja, da bi bilo že skoraj nujno parenteralno hranjenje. Ali pa v resnično slabem psihičnem stanju, ko je depresija že nekaj časa prisotna in že celo nekaj časa ne hodijo v šolo. Vsekakor bi bilo boljše, če bi ti otroci pomoč dobili prej. Na drugi strani pa je drugi ekstrem: na urgenco, v bolnišnico oziroma k pedopsihiatru prihajajo po pomoč otroci in mladostniki v stiskah, ki so normalne in bi jih morali reševati na drugih nivojih, zunaj medicine – v družini, šoli ali svetovalnici, vsekakor pa ne potrebujejo pedopsihiatrične pomoči. Na srečo se je stigma duševne stiske ali motnje močno zmanjšala, posledično pa je vedno več otrok, mladostnikov in tudi odraslih, ki poiščejo pomoč. Pojavlja pa se tudi že psihiatrizacija družbe, ko se vsako slabo počutje ali slaba ocena zdi velik problem, celo bolezen, in se išče pomoč pri pedopsihiatru, kar pa seveda tudi ni potrebno.""
Koliko k situaciji pripomorejo družbena omrežja, kot je TikTok? Velika skupina njihovih uporabnikov emocionalnim oziroma duševnim stanjem pravzaprav posveča pretirano pozornost. ""Pedopsihiatri smo se danes pravzaprav prisiljeni ukvarjati tudi s temi vidiki. Tudi sama od otrok in mladostnikov dobivam posnetke izzivov na TikToku. Obstaja subkultura otrok in mladostnikov, ki se po spletu spodbujajo k samopoškodovanju ali celo samomorilnemu vedenju, čeprav je to kaznivo dejanje. Toda ti mladostniki ne vedo, v kaj se spuščajo, ne zavedajo se, da ima lahko neka igra, nek izziv tudi smrtni izid, s čimer smo žal že tudi bili soočeni. A dandanes je takšne stvari nemogoče ustaviti. Medicina tega zagotovo ne more, še manj pedopsihiatrija. Mogoč bi bil le družben konsenz o tem, kako spletno ponudbo otrokom regulirati, toda prepričana sem, da bi bili tudi pri tem vprašanju znova močno polarizirani, kaj je treba narediti in kaj je že poseganje v svobodo in pravice vsakega posameznika."" 
Odsotnost avtoritete in porast osebnostnih motenj
Duševno zdravje posameznika je torej nedvomno povezano s stanjem družbe, ki ji ne manjka težav. Kje začeti reševanje izzivov? ""Odrasli se premalo zavedamo, da smo zgled svojim otrokom in mladostnikom. Ko odrasli rešujemo krizne situacije, se otroci od nas učijo vzorca reševanja. Če krizno situacijo rešujemo tako, da smo žaljivi in agresivni ter za nastalo situacijo krivimo druge, potem je to tudi sporočilo otrokom, kako naj rešujejo težave, ko bodo v krizi. Osebno mi je bilo težko gledati starše, ki so pred osnovnimi šolami protestirali proti nošenju mask in testiranju. Seveda imajo ti starši povsem legitimno pravico povedati, da se s tem ne strinjajo. Toda protestirati pred šolo z otrokom ob sebi ter se z učitelji pogovarjati z žaljivim in agresivnim tonom je slabo sporočilo otrokom. To bi morali izpeljati bolj zrelo, bolj odraslo. Kajti kako naj zdaj otroci, ki so bili zraven, spoštujejo učitelje ali šolo? In kako bodo ti starši ukrepali, ko se bodo ti otroci agresivno,  žaljivo in nespoštljivo obnašali do njih samih? Krivili šolo? Iskali pomoč pri pedopsihiatru?""
 
A strokovnjakinja poudarja, da za vse skupaj ni kriv le covid, ampak gre za odraz družbenih sprememb, ki so se začele že nekaj desetletij pred njegovim pojavom. ""Uničili smo vse avtoritete. Učitelji v današnji družbi niso nobena avtoriteta več, kot družba in starši smo jim to avtoriteto vzeli. Avtoriteta nismo zdravniki ali znanstveniki, saj sta to zdaj že skoraj slabšalna izraza, avtoriteto sta izgubili tudi politika in Cerkev. Toda če otroci nimajo nobene avtoritete, je to zanje slabo. Stanje, ko ne vedo, po kom se lahko zgledujejo, komu naj si prizadevajo biti podobni in s kom se lahko pozitivno identificirajo, je slabo za njihov razvoj. Posledica pa je, da se zatekajo k najrazličnejšim vprašljivim in nekonstruktivnim načinom identifikacije. Odrasli se namreč v svetu brez avtoritete še morda znajdemo, otroci pa ne. Če morajo hoditi v šolo, pa jim nenehno govorimo, da so učitelji bedaki, ki ničesar ne vedo, da zdravniki nimajo pojma, ker so vsi podkupljeni, politiki pa so tako in tako same barabe, se znajdejo pred vprašanjem, kaj v tej družbi, v kateri morajo odrasti, sploh še deluje. Zakaj naj odrastejo, če pa ni nobenega odraslega, ki bi mu radi bili podobni? Tudi zato se čedalje pogosteje soočamo z osebnostnimi motnjami. To je okvir duševnih motenj, ki so zelo trdovratne in ki jih še pred desetimi leti ni bilo toliko, kot jih je sedaj. V hospitalni oskrbi imajo skoraj tri četrtine mladostnikov diagnozo 'razvijajoča se osebnostna motnja', to pa je delno tudi odraz družbenih sprememb, ki smo jim priča.""
*Poglobljen pogovor o osebnostnih motnjah z izred. prof. . dr. Hojko Gregorič Kumperščak bomo objavili prihodnjo nedeljo.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/besic-loredan.html,"Bešič Loredan: 'The argument of power prevails here, not the power of argument'","He stood up for his patients and was fired. Because of him, people took to the streets and protested against corruption in healthcare. As he says, half a billion euros are lost in healthcare every year, and a hundred of them are corruption. He knows the answer to why both the left and the right political option work in this way, when the government does not want to break the supply chains, due to which Slovenians overpay for medical supplies. He is one of the few doctors who dared to expose himself publicly. Due to excessive pressure, he was employed in Switzerland for some time. At the time of covida-19, he warns: in modern healthcare, other invisible patients should not be disadvantaged by the epidemic. But in our corruption-ridden healthcare system, covid-19 has the most money ever. Will taxpayers be robbed again?","Why did all three doctors - Bešič Loredan, Erik Brecelj and Marko Noč - who dared to stand up to the government and point out corruption in healthcare, find themselves in disfavor?
""I think that in the society we are in and in the system we are in, none of the rulers is happy for someone to reveal the facts. I am of the opinion that the argument of power prevails in our country today, not the power of argument. we always served with arguments. We showed a mirror to the system. And it's not nice when they hear these things. Because there are few of us and because we are weak, the system silences us, ""Besic Loredan replied.
But why don't more doctors decide to expose themselves? The doctor believes that there are many like them, but a group of young doctors, ie doctors aged 27 to 45, do not dare to do so, ""because if you expose yourself in this system, you quickly get on your toes"". ""And you're quickly limited in your career, in the system, they put you on the sidelines.""
However, everything in this system suits everyone as it is today, he pointed out.
EUR 500 million in losses, EUR 100 million for corruption - these are the figures that Bešič Loredan pointed out years ago at the initiative of doctors. ""We made this calculation around 2012 and 2013 with economists and lawyers. In a system where there are four billion euros that we practically produce, 500 million is not about treatment, but about everything that belongs to treatment. Systemic corruption is has infiltrated the system in such a way that we no longer have one godfather, as in mafia management, but we have a whole bunch of small godparents who have spread out nicely across the system, and suppliers have a billion euros all these years being pulled out of the system - regardless of the crisis, everything. ""
The system has become so ingrained in 15 and 20 years that it is difficult to change it, added Bešič Loredan. When he took over the prime minister's chair two years ago, Janez Janša announced that he would cut corruption in healthcare, and this year we published photos of him hanging out with one of the biggest healthcare lobbyists in Slovenia, Božo Dimnik. Loredan Bešič replied that it is very difficult for a citizen to see the Prime Minister to associate with these people. ""I was disappointed and such a prime minister has a hard time overcoming the government's corrupt tactics.""
But why don't more doctors decide to expose themselves? The doctor believes that there are many like them, but a group of young doctors aged 27 to 45 do not dare to do so, ""because if you expose yourself in this system, you quickly get on your toes"". ""And you're quickly limited in your career, in the system, they put you on the sidelines."" However, everything in this system suits everyone as it is today, he pointed out.
""I would like us to finally come to the fact that we are reaching a social consensus that we know we have raised so much and so much money for treatment and it is all about treatment. What is being abused all the time is public health. Public health is a human right,"" to get to the doctor when they need him. When we accept that, we will also be able to make a reform. But neither this policy nor any other will stop it. ""
He believes that anyone who intends to be the Prime Minister should be a role model and have zero tolerance for corruption. But ""both the left and the right - when the lights go out - sit down at the table and agree on who will get how much from this cake, and the cake is worth four billion euros.""
He has been warning about corruption since 2013. During the time when Alenka Bratušek was the Prime Minister, he managed to gather people, 4,000 of whom took to the streets and loudly warned about corruption in healthcare.
It was interesting then. I spent endless hours with the presidents of the CCP and the NPU - they told me not to worry about anything happening to me. At that time I even received information that Alenka Bratušek said that 'let's shut up' of this Loredan and Brecl '. "" He went on to say that even then neither of them had and does not intend to enter politics even today.
""Politics in this set does not intend to set up a health care system and withdraw from the health care system, which would be right. Unfortunately, this is the case and today my biggest disappointment or tragedy is that if we had elections today, I believe 60 percent it would be good to vote because they have no one to vote for. ""
During the government of Miro Cerar, he collected 10,500 signatures for the resignation of the then Minister of Health Milojka Kolar Celarc. ""I was lucky to connect a large number of people, but unfortunately, as I see it, nothing is changing. We are not yet at the point where there could be a breakthrough,"" he explained, adding that Slovenia as a society is divided. ""Politics is the way it is, but if someone wants to say something out loud, they get it right on their toes.""
He also touched on the apparent crisis in the country and said that, in his opinion, it was the coronavirus that showed how ""the health system in the country is poorly organized"". He pointed out all the canceled services that in the modern healthcare system, even if it is due to covida-19, should not suffer.
“The moment we come to realize that public health is a value and a good, that patients need to see a doctor when they need it and that the state has to take care of it, no matter whether publicly or privately, then we will be on point out from where we are. """

""Better Šarec in hand than Golob on the roof,"" said Marjan Šarec, the LMŠ champion and new political face in the last elections, skeptical of Robert Golob's possible new political face. On Wednesday, the President of the National Assembly Igor Zorčič will officially launch his party Lide.","Four months before the election, there is considerable tension among center-left parties. Mainly due to the unclear fate of Robert Golob, who is increasingly flirting with state politics with a new public tribune in Maribor on Thursday. ""Better Šarec in his hand than Golob on the roof,"" said the head of the largest opposition party.
""For me, what is already known and tested is certainly better. Than what we don't know yet if it is. But that may change in the coming weeks,"" says LMŠ president Marjan Šarec.
There is no sympathy for other KUL members either. ""There are too many unknowns. We don't really know anything yet. Of course, in a democratic space, any new player or political party is welcome. Janez Janša, ""said SD president Tanja Fajon.
Tomorrow, Igor Zorčič will establish his party Lide at a short and formal congress. He is supposed to lead it only as interim president with the possibility of supplementing the wider leadership in case of integration. But here is already the first basket for a politician who first helped form Janša's government, later opposed constructive distrust, and after leaving the coalition remained president of the National Assembly.
""It's hard to talk to such opportunists,"" says Šarec.
Milan Kučan, the first president of the republic and still an influential man on the political left, thinks otherwise. A new face would be welcome, he says. ""In principle, I think the shock of the existing political 'establishment' is good in any case.""
However, Kučan, together with many other well-known academic and socio-political names, supported the idea of ​​a radical change in the Slovenian electoral system. It is a civil society initiative that seeks to reduce party power and increase voter influence, but is not yet intended for the April elections."
https://www.24ur.com/sport/ostalo/v-stozicah-predstavili-rokometni-ep-za-zenske.html,The women's handball European Championship was presented in Stožice,"In addition to sports, the Women's European Handball Championship, which will also be hosted by Slovenia in November, will focus on the sustainability and empowerment of women in society, which is why the championship has 17 ambassadors.","At today's presentation of the championship in Stožice, the president of the Handball Association of Slovenia (RZS) Franjo Bobinac emphasized the importance of sport for society. ""This will be the most important sporting event for women ever hosted by Slovenia. We are proud and happy to be part of this organization. We are confident that we will prepare an event that will go beyond sport. Sport is a link and a great ambassador of reputation our country, ""Bobinac is convinced.
Along with Slovenia, the championship will also be hosted by Northern Macedonia and Montenegro. Just as it is an honor for Slovenia, the organization of the championship is also an honor for Macedonia and Montenegro. ""This will be the second organization of the Women's European Championship for us. Handball is the number one sport in Macedonia, so we are looking forward to a successful tournament,"" said Aleksander Stefanov, a member of the executive committee of the Northern Macedonia Handball Federation.
They expect long-term effects
The president of the Montenegrin Handball Federation, Petar Kapisoda, explained that the championship is a great honor and obligation for their small country, but that they have proven their organizational skills in the past. The president of the European Handball Federation, Michael Wiederer, said that he expected an excellent organization of the championship and the long-term effects that the organization would bring.
The course of the championship could also be affected by an unpredictable health situation, which the president of the SBS is aware of. ""Only suckers don't have a plan B. We have one, we also have a plan C. Personally, I doubt that there would be no competition as such, but the question is what the health situation will be then and how many spectators will be able to watch the event live. by far the most unknowns, ”he believes.
Bobinac is convinced that sport is an incredible unifier of the nation. “In the times we live in, when we are torn apart by viruses and too often politics, sport is the one that makes our lives better,” he said, explaining that the organizers decided the championship would have two pillars: sustainability and empowerment of women.
17 ambassadors
And women were at the forefront of today's event, as the organizers presented 16 successful Slovenian women from various fields, ambassadors of the championship. As it was heard, the ambassador is just for one handball team.
The ambassadors are Alja Brglez from the office of President Borut Pahor, photographer Barbara Čeferin, director of RK Krim Mercator Deja Doler Ivanović, Mojca Doupona from the Ministry of Education, Ljubljana deputy mayors Tjaša Ficko, Vanja Hrovat from Zavarovalnica Generali, director of RTA Katarina Karlovšek, Geo Vppa Lombar Mateja Lončar from Siemens Slovenia, Maja Pak from the Slovenian Tourist Board, lawyer Nataša Pirc Musar, director of the Auto-Moto Association of Slovenia Lucija Sajevec, Melanie Seier Larsen from Boston Consulting Group, Milena Štular from the Botrstvo project, Tanja Subotić Levanič from Pivovarna Laško Union, Ajša Maja Zalaznik, a guide from the American Chamber of Commerce in Slovenia and a professor at the Faculty of Economics in Ljubljana.
""Ambassadors can show the wider society that it is possible to succeed in various fields. Many ambassadors come from sports. We have had several careers, we have successfully returned to society with another profession. This can inspire young women, handball players and beyond. , ""says Doupona about the role of ambassador. She added that they want to show in some way that sport can only be a springboard so that they can then work even better in society later.
Senidah took care of the championship anthem
At the presentation of the championship, they also pointed out three former very successful handball players who work in the field of women's empowerment. These are Marta Bon, coordinator of ambassadors and member of the executive committee of the European Handball Federation and president of the Gender Equality Commission at the OKS, Tanja Polajnar, director of the Ljubljana Sports Institute, and Alenka Cuderman, coordinator of women's handball at the European Handball Federation.
The special ambassador of the championship will also be the singer Senidah, who will take care of the anthem of the championship. This one is titled Play with heart. The anthem, as she said today, will be in English, and it will be heard for the first time before the summer. ""I am honored to be an ambassador and to work together to support the largest such women's event in Slovenia.

This will be after the end of the epidemic, if no immediate radical changes are needed and less and less public with longer waiting times, they are convinced in FIDES, where they add that it is no longer possible to close one's eyes before that.
The demands and needs of Slovenian public health care are growing faster than the available number of doctors. In the absence of doctors, it is necessary to do everything to not only keep in the system, but also to attract the necessary staff in the long run. We need at least 1,000 additional doctors to approach the European average, according to FIDES.
At the same time, they provided information that Austria has 5.3 doctors per thousand inhabitants, Germany 4.4, and Slovenia only 3.3 doctors per 1000 population, which is 15 percent behind the EU average of 3.9. They point out that public health institutions have become uncompetitive with private providers and offers from neighboring neighborhoods, where even the most ardent advocates of public health go.
""It is not the doctors who are responsible for this situation, but the policy that did not bite the necessary reform measures and pour pure wine on citizens regarding the future of the public health system. Unfortunately, we doctors outbreaks of hostilities, ""they warned.
As they added, they are aware that an efficient and accessible public health system requires comprehensive health reform and radical structural changes in the segments of financing, organization and management.
""This is a major short- and medium-term challenge in which doctors as partners are willing to work constructively,"" they wrote at the extraordinary annual FIDES conference, which calls for the immediate implementation of the 10th Anti-Crown Law and the completion of a new health care pay system law.
According to FIDES, this is the first of the necessary steps if we want to keep top professionals and young doctors in the system. ""The current pay system does not allow this and is gradually dismantling public health,"" they said at FIDES, which is committed to maintaining an accessible and efficient public health system.
With the new law for mitigation of the consequences of covida-19, the National Assembly raised the upper limit for the classification of doctors and dentists in salary grades. With the enactment of the law by the end of 2022, they will be able to be ranked up to the 63rd salary grade, which is six more than now. Therefore, the opposition pointed out that the provision means an increase in salaries only for the best paid doctors, while young doctors and other health professionals remain overlooked. In some trade union centers, they are announcing the submission of a request for a constitutional review of the part of the law that increases the salaries of doctors."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/pss-ovadil-antona-olaja.html,"The police union reported Olaja, followed by complaints from other officials","The Police Union of Slovenia (PSS) has filed a criminal complaint with the Specialized State Prosecutor's Office against Police Director Anton Olaj on suspicion of committing a criminal offense - Violation of the right to participate in management and violation of trade union rights. According to our unofficial information, procedures are also being prepared. complaints against other responsible persons in the Police.","As we have already reported, the PSS recently announced a complaint against the Director General of the Police, Anton Olaj, on suspicion of obstructing trade union activities. He will be followed by a claim for damages, they said in a press release.
They also announced that in the coming days they will file criminal charges and compensation claims against other civil servants for obstructing trade union activities. At the same time, they wrote that in cooperation with an authorized law firm, they are investigating some other suspicions of committing criminal offenses allegedly committed by officials or public servants within the GPU inspections ordered by Olaj.
According to our unofficial information, procedures are being prepared. complaints also against other responsible persons in the Police who allegedly exert either political pressure on employees or otherwise abuse their authority and official position. In addition, according to our information, individual inspections of the Ministry of the Interior and the GPU are also under scrutiny, as there is a suspicion that these inspections were politically motivated and that the targets were specific individuals. This is supposed to try to discredit individual police officers.
Janko Goršek, a recently retired former director general of the Police, also spoke in an interview with 24ur.com about political pressure to work in the Police. As he said, the elected officials of the ruling politics occupied the most important positions, while the others were withdrawn from important positions. He said some co-workers quickly succumbed to political instructions, and a rift arose among co-workers.
""We should not allow politics to subjugate the police force. I am disappointed and saddened by all my former colleagues who have been dismissed or transferred, even though they have always been considered experts in their fields, have been successful and professional,"" he said. he said. He noted that the people who formed the pillar of professional and legal work are now victims of discrediting and untrue accusations. ""Most landed in Tacen offices, pushed away from everything, even though they devoted their entire careers to the police and were loyal exclusively to this house. They never served the interests of politics. There was no room for politics in the police. So it's bizarre, these people accuses political action. ""
He described the stories happening in the police as ""brutal"", noting that the choice of staff is no longer decided professionally, and the political authorities do not stop at the replacement of disruptive staff, but demand further action against them. ""Criminal charges are being filed, warnings are being issued before the termination of employment, severe pressure is being created on them, and they are being harassed or mobbed.""
Goršek emphasized that the reckoning with disruptive personnel was a suspicion of criminal offenses, adding that such actions would have to be investigated in the future and that action would be taken if it turned out that they had exceeded their authority. He said many in the police will be planning criminal charges against those responsible.
He also pointed out the large number of inspections by the Ministry of the Interior, as they were allegedly abused for political purposes. ""I will not be surprised if it turns out that individuals have exceeded their authority and perhaps even abused their official position. Namely, the question arises whether the supervisors really checked only the exercise of police powers and tasks, or whether it was ever even intentional finding fault with a view to discrediting certain people and their work. ""
Goršek also finds it unbelievable that trade unionists are threatened with complaints and are trying to discipline them. the former director general says this is inappropriate and unacceptable."

Kazakhstan, meanwhile, got a new prime minister, Alihan Smailov, after a good week of violent riots. The latter blamed his predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbayev, for all the problems in the country.","""The main mission of the CSTO peacekeeping force has been successfully fulfilled,"" Kasim Zhomart Tokayev reiterated in today's video conference address to members of the government and parliament, announcing a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces.
More than 2,000 CSTO troops, comprising Armenia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in addition to Russia and Kazakhstan, arrived in Kazakhstan at the height of the crisis last week at the invitation of Tokayev himself. Several days of fierce fighting between opponents of the authorities and security forces and the looting that accompanied it had already completely devastated parts of Almaty's largest city.
With the help of domestic security forces and foreign troops, Tokayev managed to quell the unrest, which he described as an attempted coup. He claims they were in fact ignited by ""professionals"" and armed extremists from Central Asia, Afghanistan and the Middle East, who are said to be mingling with protesters angry over high fuel prices in an oil and gas-rich Central Asian country.
Kazakh television reported, citing the health ministry on Sunday, that more than 160 people had died and more than 2,000 injured in the riots. The number was deleted by the state media in the evening, without giving a reason. According to the latest data from the Ministry of the Interior, almost 10,000 people have been arrested so far.
According to foreign news agencies, Tokayev has now further strengthened his position by unanimously confirming his ally Alihan Smailov's position as prime minister today. Smailov, 49, first became interim prime minister a week ago after the ouster of his previous government, but has now taken over as head of government at Tokaj's suggestion.
According to experts, the president also used the crisis to ""tie his hands"" to his predecessor and mentor, longtime Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev. Even after his withdrawal from the top of the country in 2019, he was still considered the strongest politician in the country.
In the face of unrest, Tokayev succeeded him at the head of an influential security council a few days ago, and he also got rid of several of Nazarbayev's allies, who held important positions. Among other things, Karim Masimov, director of the intelligence agency, was fired and then arrested on Saturday."

On the occasion of the holiday, which was declared unconstitutional by the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2016, he received the Order of the Flag of the Republika Srpska with a silver wreath. Labernik has repeatedly advocated Dodik's views in the past.","The political situation on the Banja Luka-Sarajevo-Brussels line has been deteriorating for several months. The international community and BiH authorities attribute the blame for the tensions to the nationalist and separatist tendencies of the Bosnian Serb representative in the BiH presidency, Milorad Dodik, while he claims that he only demands implementation of the Dayton provisions and that BiH has no future in its current form. Dodik's rhetoric was further exacerbated by US sanctions against him and the media directly under his control.
Republika Srpska celebrated Republic Day last weekend. It is a holiday that provokes very negative emotions in the rest of BiH, as it marks the day when Serbian deputies in 1992 proclaimed the Serbian Republic of BiH in the SR BiH parliament, directing Bosnia and Herzegovina on the path of more than three years of bloody conflict with many war victims. crimes and ethnic cleansing. That is why the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina has declared the holiday unconstitutional.
This did not prevent the former Slovenian Ambassador to BiH (2001-2005) Tadej Labernik from attending a ceremony at the Banski dvor in Banja Luka on Saturday, where he received an award ""for his work and extraordinary merits and personal contribution to the development of political, cultural and spiritual ties between Slovenia and the Republika Srpska "".
""I am grateful for the attention and recognition for my humble contribution to peace, freedom, democracy and cooperation, which are the values ​​we are fighting for together. I belong to a generation that has survived tectonic change, and we must be aware that it will never be like ""It used to be. The wheel of history stops only when it goes astray,"" Labernik said, recalling that the time when he was ambassador to BiH was a time of optimism.
He added that the Dayton Agreement is a platform for an agreement to be reached by the actors in BiH, and that the state must pursue its strategic interests. He congratulated the residents on Republic Day.
We asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about their position on Labernik's recognition, and we were also interested in the attitude of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the celebration of the Day of the Republic of Srpska. The ministry reiterated that the BiH Constitutional Court had declared the holiday unconstitutional. ""Judgments of constitutional courts, as well as judgments of all other courts, must be taken into account."" The ministry added that they had no information that the Slovenian government had been asked to agree to the awarding of the decoration to Tadej Labernik.
He has defended and praised Dodik in the past
Labernik, who served as Slovenia's ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina between 2001 and 2005 - before that he was director of the STA for seven years - has repeatedly defended the positions of leaders in the Republika Srpska. He was also a reviewer of Dodik's books The Struggle for a Republic and The Will of the Nation, in which Dodik based his view on the future of BiH and the Serbian entities in it.
Regarding the book Borba za republiku, Labernik wrote that ""Dodik not only recognizes the problems, but goes a step further than others and anticipates the unfolding of events"". In the review, he also wrote that the book is an authentic document that will help historians and analysts to understand things and recognize that Dodik is part of the solution, not the problem.
""Part of the international community has tried to destabilize Republika Srpska with the help of so-called people's initiatives and enable the victory of forces that would degrade the Dayton Accords and strengthen the centralization of BiH. Some political forces in BiH still do not understand that politics is what can be , and not the power of coercion, ""Labernik said at the presentation of Dodik 's book in 2019.
He also participated with Dodik in a round table broadcast by TV Slovenia in 2007. At that time, Milorad Dodik and historian Božo Repe became embroiled in a verbal dispute over Serbia's responsibility for the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. When the Ljubljana studio lost contact with Banja Luka and Dodik, Labernik pointed out the guilt of other parties involved and the international community for the war in BiH. He opposed the centralization of BiH, the abolition of the Republika Srpska and the violation of the Dayton provisions, and spoke about the Serb victims in the vicinity of Srebrenica and the crimes against Serbian civilians, Belgrade's Politika reported at the time.
It is worth mentioning that Dodik recently met with both the Hungarian and Slovenian prime ministers. Viktor Orban promised assistance to the Republika Srpska and emphasized that Hungary would veto any attempt to sanction the Republika Srpska in the EU.
Protests for a united BiH in several cities around the world
Protests for a united BiH took place in several cities around the world and in Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday. Participants expressed concern over the current political crisis in the country. The organizers of the protests also sent a letter to many world and Bosnian politicians, in which they presented their demands and position on current events.
Protests have been announced for today in Brussels, Geneva, London, Ottawa, Oslo, Rome, Vienna and Stockholm, among others, and in BiH in Sarajevo and Tuzla. In some places, the protests have already started at noon, including in Brussels, where, according to the recordings on social networks, a few dozen people gathered.
These are mostly BiH citizens living abroad, and other like-minded people have also been invited to the protests. The main organizer is Platforma BiH, based in the Netherlands, Bosnian portals report.
The organizers warn that BiH citizens abroad are worried about the political crisis in the country, as they believe that deep divisions will be created again and that potential conflicts will arise. With protests and a letter sent to US President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, among others, they want to remind the international community and politicians that it is necessary to stop all secessionist and unconstitutional activities in the Republic of Srpska and maintain peace in the country. ."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/v-banjaluki-organizirali-parado-ob-neustavnem-prazniku.html,A parade was organized in Banja Luka on the occasion of an unconstitutional holiday,"The authorities of the Republika Srpska organized a parade in Banja Luka on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the establishment of this entity, despite the fact that the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared this holiday unconstitutional. The Serbian member of the Presidency of BiH, Milorad Dodik, stated that the Republic is a Serbian state. Nearly 3,000 people took part in the parade in central Banja Luka, including several hundred police officers and horsemen who paraded as helicopters overflew.","They also walked in front of the rostrum, where the Russian ambassador to BiH, Igor Kalabukov, was present alongside Bosnian Serb officials and military officers from Serbia. ""Ceremonial parade on the day of the Republic of Srpska,"" they accompanied the posts on Twitter.

The Republika Srpska is celebrating Republic Day on January 9, in memory of that day in 1992, when some members of the then parliament of the SR BiH proclaimed the Serb Republic of BiH. Already in 2016, the Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina passed a judgment annulling part of the law on holidays in the Republika Srpska, which designated January 9 as the holiday of the republic.
The court ruled that the celebration of the day, which marked the beginning of a campaign of mass ethnic persecution of non-Serbs from the territory of today's Republika Srpska, offended the feelings of Croats and Bosniaks.

Parade in response to the imposition of US sanctions
Dodik said that January 9, 1992 was the result of efforts to prevent a recurrence of crimes against Serbs committed in World War II, so the decision was made to form the state from parts of BiH. ""Republika Srpska is our country, but whoever wants to oppose it,"" Dodik said, adding that Sunday's parade in Banja Luka was also a response to the recent imposition of sanctions.
The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on the Bosnian Serb leader and his associated television network for threatening the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region as a whole. Dodik then said that this would not stop him in his intentions and political goals and that he would listen to the wishes of his people and not the demands of the US. He is counting on the support of Serbia and other world allies, which he did not name."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/kucanov-govor.html,"Kučan: Today's images of fascism are not the same as those in history, but the starting points are the same","""War is an evil against humanity, which is why working for peace is so very valuable,"" said former President Milan Kučan at a central ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Dražgoš. In his speech, he also commented very critically on the functioning of the government. ""It is necessary to say where the disintegration of the constitutional order, attempts to rule by decrees, circumvention of the law, attacks on the judiciary, the prosecutor's office and freedom of the press can lead,"" he said, adding that this should be resisted. ""Today's images of fascism are not the same as those of half-past history. But the starting points are the same,"" he said, noting the upcoming elections as the only democratic means of changing power.","At the central ceremony marking the 80th anniversary of the Battle of Dražgoš, President Borut Pahor laid a wreath at the monument to fallen fighters and other victims. Last year, the event, which usually brings together thousands of people, was canceled, but this year it is limited by epidemiological measures.
The keynote speaker was former President Milan Kučan, who said that the fight and resistance of Cankar's battalion fighters was followed by crime and recalled the revenge of the German army, which attacked the locals, whose only sin was to love their homeland and helped defend. The Battle of Dražgoš, which took place between 9 and 11 January 1942, is considered one of the largest battles during the Second World War in Slovenia, which shook the myth of the invincibility of the German army. Nine partisans fell in the battle, and after it the Germans killed 41 locals and burned the village.
Kučan emphasized that war is an evil against humanity and that is why working for peace is so very valuable. He added that there was also peace in the war, provoked by the YPA's aggression against the Slovene nation, when it exercised its natural right to self-determination. ""Slovenians did not want a war. We wanted to enforce our decision in a peaceful way,"" he said, assuring that our resistance was sensible, as it paved the way for Slovenia's international recognition. ""The struggle and sacrifice of Slovenes during the Second World War also made sense. They were a disproportionately large contribution to the defense of human civilization against the barbarism brought about by fascism,"" he said.
""Fascism has grown into a state ideology and a tool for militaristic politics""
""We live in a situation where the world is facing a serious, difficult-to-manage threat posed by the epidemic,"" Kučan is convinced. He notes that there are worrying encroachments on the foundations of the values ​​on which modern democratic society and the international legal order are based. ""They are inherited by populisms and nationalisms, anti-solidarity sovereign doctrines and egoisms, within which there are more and more signs of a revival of fascism.""
""We must not forget that fascism grew into a state ideology and a means of militaristic policy with war of conquest and crimes against humanity by using and abusing the mechanisms of democratic parliamentary democracy. We Slovenes were also the target of this ideology."" That is why, he said, we should remain sensitive in recognizing the signs of its restoration. ""Therefore, we must draw attention to them in the new situation and call them by their real names. Understandably, today's images of fascism are not the same as those of half-past history. But the starting points are the same,"" he said.
""Attempts to rule by decrees, circumventing and blackmailing laws, attacks on independence""
""It is necessary to say where the disintegration of the constitutional order, attempts to rule by decrees, circumventing and blackmailing laws, interventions in the principle of separation of powers, attacks on the judiciary and judges, the independence of prosecutors and police, oversight institutions, freedom of the press, freedom of the human rights and dignity, which lead to the use and promotion of hate speech and vulgarity, disrespect for church and state separation, attitudes towards refugees, abuse of historiography and equating patriotism with the demand for support for the current government and the largest government party. ""
Kučan is convinced that this should be pointed out and that it should be resisted in the name of respect for the freedom-loving efforts of past generations and responsibility for the future. He says that we Slovenes are scattered like never before and that we are also divided by the ruthless display of power of the current authorities, which systematically introduces new divisions into people's lives.
""In taking action to control the epidemic, they are looking for the culprits for the failed fight""
Kucan was also critical of the government's response to the epidemic. He pointed out that the government is not looking for an alliance with the citizens, but is looking for the culprits among them for the failed fight against the epidemic. ""Peaceful protesters are considered enemies. They refuse dialogue with them, responding to their proposals, demands and objections with police repression,"" he stressed.
He also finds it controversial that at the time of the 30th anniversary celebrations, we are listening to the bookkeeping list of government achievements. He believes that these achievements are in fact the achievements of the entire Slovenian society, the efforts and sacrifices of the vast majority of citizens. However, in his opinion, achievements are not what divide Slovenian society. ""They divide things that the ruling politics does not talk about, but does them by gross, illegitimate and illegal encroachments on the constitutional legal and social value fabric of society. It does them against the will of the people in the name of hidden political and ideological goals: its extent in the desire for the so-called shift of the entire social structure to the right, even to the extreme right. ""
It is precisely because of the recognition of these tendencies that there is resistance among the people, Kučan added in his speech. He says that the government cannot hide these tendencies by distributing pre-election gifts and attempts to bribe individual social groups with indulgences, nor by promising infrastructure and other investments to mayors. ""They cannot be overshadowed by the fact that such a division of EU funds intended for recovery and development after the epidemic does not allow for serious strategic and structural investments that would bring Slovenia closer to the goal of a green, digital and high-tech country. this exclusive policy of the government is moving away. ""

""Instead of self-praise, we need a fair and realistic assessment""
He is also convinced that instead of boasting, we need a fair and realistic assessment of both the situation and the price we will pay for it. The time after the epidemic will be demanding, and recovery will be long and difficult. Governance will require the trust and support of citizens, including renunciation. ""The false image is misleading and does not allow for recovery. It also does not shift responsibility with the false image to the future government,"" he added.
Therefore, her false painting must be resisted. We must not be fooled. We need to be aware of the cost of the apparent short-sighted benefits. The answer to whether we are ready for this will be given in the upcoming elections. These are the only democratic means of changing power. That is why it is necessary to take part in the elections and think about who to entrust your vote to. This should be the message of this year's memorial meeting in Dražgoše.
The organizers provided up to 750 seats for the event
The ceremony in Dražgoše represents the culmination of the 65th set of events along the paths of partisan Jelovica. The organizing committee, led by retired Major General Ladislav Lipič, decided to hold the ceremony despite the current epidemiological situation. The Škofja Loka Administrative Unit has received a permit for the event, and they must meet special conditions, including the restriction of people in the event space, where the organizers will provide up to 750 seats. As Lipič expects, this will be enough given the situation.
Only two traditional hikes are planned and these two will be significantly shorter than usual when they lasted all night. The number of hikers will also be limited. 43rd march The route of the Cankar Battalion to Dražgoše will not start at Pasja ravna, but at Log in Poljanska dolina, and the start will be in the morning. The traditional 22nd hike Železniki-Ratitovec-Jelovica-Dražgoše will also be shortened, mainly due to the large amounts of snow on Jelovica."

The Ministry of the Interior accuses him of causing costs to the Police, who guarded the rally in October 2020, by around 2,255 euros. Jenull replies that he is not the organizer and that they will not stop by intimidating the protesters.","According to Dnevnik, the ministry, represented by the State Attorney's Office, claims that Jaša Jenull organized an unregistered rally in the center of Ljubljana on October 2, 2020, which means that the police have higher costs of protecting events than if the rally had been reported. Among other things, the police claim that they had to bring 80 police officers to the streets instead of 20 because they did not know how many people would gather at the rally.
The lawsuit also states the price list of individual services of the Police - an hour of a police officer at a protest costs from 18.70 to 25.33 euros, a service horse costs 11.30 euros per hour, and a police dog 11.02 euros per hour.
It also describes the protest on Prešeren Square, in front of the Ministry of Health in Štefanova ulica, on Trg republike in front of the National Assembly building and on the streets of Ljubljana. Jenull is also mentioned as one of the speakers in the description of the events. According to the Interior Ministry, the State Attorney's Office also cited a post on his Facebook profile as proof that Jenull was organizing the protest.
""This is a violation of the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens to peaceful protest,"" Jenull commented on the lawsuit for Dnevnik. ""I am not an organizer, the protests are spontaneous. Politics has appointed one organizer to put financial pressure on the protest movement. Such a practice is dictatorial,"" he warns.
The Legal Network for the Protection of Democracy also pointed out that this was a form of intimidation of protesters.
Friday's protesters gathered again last night at the Republic Square, where at the 90th protest they drew attention to the political subordination of RTV and other Slovenian media. The protesters demand from the new government the immediate annulment of all appointments and procedures carried out by the government of Janez Janša on RTV Slovenia in the last 20 months, they announced.

In a video she posted on Instagram, the Tuscan singer announced her candidacy for the successor to President Sergio Mattarella, whose seven-year term expires on February 3.","Nannini's candidacy comes when there is a debate in Italy that the time has come for Italy to get a woman at the head of the state for the first time in history. ""On this occasion, I am officially running for president of the Italian Republic,"" the 67-year-old Nannini said in a video released.

While Belgrade insists the Australian government is using the Serbian tennis ace to score political points, Australian authorities reject the allegations. Novak Djokovic is not our prisoner and can leave the country whenever he wants, they say in Canberra, after his visa was revoked and he was placed in a hotel for immigrants in Melbourne. For the first time, Đoković also appeared on social networks and thanked his supporters. They insist on protests both in his homeland and in a country that has denied him hospitality.","The tensions and emotional reactions in the Djokovic affair do not seem to end. While the world's best tennis player awaits Monday's court epilogue, his followers from the Serbian diaspora continue to gather in front of the hotel for immigrants in Melbourne. Some see a lot of symbolism: that such injustice happens on Orthodox Christmas, that Novak is actually a prisoner, a martyr. At the request of his family, protest rallies continue in Belgrade.
The main protagonist of the saga broke the silence today and thanked on Instagram for the exceptional support around the world. But anger is growing on the other side as well. The tennis ace, known for his anti-vaccination views, has rocked the wasp’s nest by citing a medical exemption when entering Australia. Tired of the extremely harsh anti-antiviral measures, many Australians resented his move, saying that the famous and the rich were obviously demanding different rules for themselves. Although he was not the only one to claim an exemption from vaccination when he arrived at the tennis tournament.
Sociologist Primož Šterbenc said in the 24UR ZVEČER show that the case has grown from the indignation of the Australian public into an interstate dispute between Serbia and Australia and that this is a clash of two cultures. For the first time, a global star like Novak Djokovic has been at the heart of the vaccination issue, which has deeply divided Western societies. How will this affect clarification, what is right and what is not about vaccination?
Marketing expert Aljoša Bagola said that the pandemic, as far as our views were concerned, ""turned out to be a fast-drying cement and so the world remained in a kind of constant disunity"". ""And this pros and cons, which social networks are still fanning, has actually become a kind of prosthesis that we use instead of some common solutions. Interestingly, it all happened on the anniversary of the attack on the Capitol when Donald Trump addressed his supporters. let them resort to violence. ""
And such matters are possible only when people identify with the story that they are victims of some conspiracy, Bagola added. ""And then they see in the star the embodiment of a savior of all their troubles. Many see Djokovic as a savior, as the Messiah on a mission.""
He went on to say, however, that fame always goes hand in hand with his ugly sister, and that is abuse. ""Interestingly, Roger Federer recently said he doesn't really know if he would be mentally fit enough if he started his career in an age of social media and these constant negative comments.""
Opponents of vaccination experience vaccination as an encroachment on their freedom, their rights. The Australians, however, reverse this logic and accuse Djokovic of encroaching on their rights because he does not respect the rules like everyone else. Could this change the perception of the concept of freedom, solidarity and justice when it comes to vaccination? Šterbenc said that on the one hand there is the right not to interfere with the body, and on the other hand the right to health and life. In this case, it is objectively clear which right should have more attention. In addition, it should be clarified that in today's neoliberal era, only rights are emphasized, and far too few duties. And in the case of what is happening today, we could say that society has been shedonized in many ways. Critical values, including enjoyment values, make great strides over beautiful values, which are also moral values. ""
He added, however, that the technologicalization of society has done its thing, especially among young people who are colonized by technology. ""Technology dehumanizes. Solidarity, love is pushing to the sidelines. An epistemological problem also arises here, as most of society seeks information on social networks, where information is very unbelievable and unverified.""
In their opinion, how will the concrete story with Djokovic end? Šterbenc said that according to him, everyone will want to get something. ""Both Serbian and Australian politics. I would not dare to predict how it will end, because in a way this story has become a symbol of conflict between those who are for vaccination and those who are against vaccination.""

Students as well as young families and other individuals spend several months searching. And, as they say, they are also aware of this at the Housing Fund, where they have established a public rental service with the new year. It is a kind of mediation between private homeowners and tenants - the latter will pay the rent at a non-profit price, and the difference will be contributed by the Housing Fund.","570 euros for 33 square meters, 450 for 27 square meters. This is the reality of the rental market in the capital. And this year we will provide 100 to 200 flats with a public rental service to those who cannot afford to rent at current market prices, assures the director of the Housing Fund Črtomir Remec. ""First, an invitation will be published to the owners to register and offer us their apartments, and after we have a certain number of apartments available, we will also publish a tender for tenants,"" explains Remec.
Given the astronomically high prices currently being set by the market, they are counting on older people, who will be offered serviced apartments in exchange for larger apartments or houses, and the advantage of this type of rental for owners is a guarantee of payment, Remec points out. In the event of problems with tenants, we will take over. ""
'The amount of rent that homeowners will receive is too low'
Rents will be non-profit for tenants, and 30 percent higher for owners who will have to rent out their apartments to the fund for at least three years. And while Remec is convinced that this is good practice, the Institute for Housing and Spatial Studies thinks otherwise. ""Any housing policy that focuses on subsidizing the current situation, rather than building and rebuilding the housing stock, basically means that more and more money is spent to solve the current catastrophe, and then we have a convenient excuse, but we ran out of money to actually solving the housing problem, ""says Uroš Mikanovič, a researcher at the Institute for Housing and Spatial Studies.
Since the SORS does not keep accurate records, all figures can only be predictions, and Mikanovič also emphasizes that the amount of rent that will be received by homeowners is too low and consequently unattractive to them. ""I do not think this measure makes sense from any point of view, from any point of view,"" Mikanovič emphasized. ""Of course, the Housing Fund of the Republic of Slovenia cannot solve all the problems, but in fact we are trying with all our activities to help improve this situation,"" Remec answers.
The Ljubljana rental market will breathe a little at the end of January, when 500 new public rental apartments will be rented out in the Novo Brdo neighborhood, and these are the practices we should strive for, Mikanovič concludes."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/janko-gorsek-dogaja-se-politicno-discipliniranje-zaposlenih-v-policiji.html,Janko Goršek: Police employees are politically disciplined,"Former director general of the Slovenian Police Janko Goršek, who has been in the police force for 38 years, retired on 1 January. Although he was always convinced that it would be difficult to say goodbye to the Police when he retired, he left this house with a lighter heart because of the prevailing situation. ""Like the whole of Slovenian society, the police are completely divided due to the political situation. The ruling politics has led to the labeling of police personnel on 'ours and yours', left and right, if you will. There is political discipline of employees.""","""The elected representatives of the ruling politics have occupied the most important positions, and the disturbing cadres have landed in the 'Tacen detachment' or the 'sector of the written off', as we call it,"" Janko Goršek told 24ur.com. He regrets that some former colleagues succumbed to political instructions so quickly, without trying to resist, while forgetting all the friends who fell into disfavor with the authorities and the leadership of the Police, says our interlocutor.
""It's about brutal reckoning with police officers, inadmissible interference of politics in its work and I myself have not experienced anything like this in almost four decades. they landed in the criminal group of the written off or did not dare to associate with them, so as not to be subjected to any personnel sanctions. However, she did not apologize for their behavior. ""
""Overnight, they forgot about their colleagues, with whom they shared all the good and bad for many years, worked side by side, and were sometimes in danger on the ground. In this overheated political situation, they do not dare to express support for all those who they found themselves at the mercy of the Police leadership. They never disagreed with doing so, no one objected, even though they had advocated professionalism, legality and integrity throughout their careers. Overnight, it all blew up. ""
'When some former co-workers turn on the wind and forget the values ​​they advocated'
Political pressure on the Police also caused discord among colleagues. Many people who remained in office and were not the target of the current government quickly forgot about their colleagues and friends, took care of themselves and started sailing, as dictated by the new wind, says Goršek. ""I really wonder if these people are sleeping peacefully today. We should not allow politics to subjugate the police force. I am disappointed and saddened by all my former colleagues who have been dismissed or transferred, even though they have always been considered experts in their fields, be successful and professional. ""
""These are people I know personally, I've worked with them and monitored their careers, so I can say that they have been a pillar of professional and legal work. But now they have been hit with ugly discredits and completely untrue accusations. , pushed away from everything, even though they dedicated their entire careers to the Police and were loyal exclusively to this house. They never served the interests of politics. There was no room for politics in the Police. So it's bizarre, these people are accused of political activity interlocutor.
He himself ended his career in Tacen offices and was also repeatedly attacked by the current government. ""They published untruths that I was prosecuted for the affair of alleged Iranian money laundering, a high-ranking political official of the current government even wrote on Twitter that I allowed money laundering in the NLB, although I have never been in any proceedings for this matter. It happened to the director of the National Bureau of Investigation, who was accused without any arguments of concealing money laundering and was even illegally fired. the imagination associated with my role in this case is bizarre and goes beyond common sense, and the story above all lacks arguments and facts. Therefore, I can comment without a guilty conscience on what political pressure on the police and employees means. ""
'When I was CEO, politics never interfered with the profession, let alone staffing'
Janko Goršek was appointed Director General of the Slovenian Police in 2009. He has worked with three different interior ministers, but the professional work of police officers and criminal investigators has never been subject to politics, he says. ""No one asked us for information about criminal investigations, no one wanted the names of the suspects we were dealing with, no one exerted political pressure on investigations, let alone politicians to demand staffing and enthrone their elected officials.""
""There have been no such brutal stories in the Police so far, so most employees are shocked by what has been happening lately. If all these years the professional references were the ones that decided the selection of staff, now this practice has changed. The political authorities are going even further this time, they are not stopping at replacing disruptive staff, they are also demanding measures against them.
""I am worried and angry when I see certain police officers abusing their positions and powers and breaking the law when dealing with staff who are disruptive to the government. In my opinion, this is also a suspicion of crime. Therefore, in the future I also have information that quite a few employees have already initiated appropriate pre-trial proceedings, and many are already considering filing criminal charges against those responsible in the Police. but also sought in court. ""
""It is also worth noting the large number of inspections by the Interior Ministry, as there is a lot of talk that various controls are being misused for political purposes. Therefore, we can expect proceedings in this regard in the coming months. I will not be surprised if it turns out that individuals have exceeded their authority and perhaps even abused their official position, namely, the question arises as to whether supervisors really checked only the exercise of police powers and tasks, or whether it was even a deliberate search for errors to discredit certain people and their work. ""
'There have never been political investigations'
The former director general of the police says that there have never been political investigations, as it is clear what and who directs criminal investigations and the work of police officers - the prosecutor's office. Not politics. ""It is therefore all the more unusual for the current director general to state that some investigations have been politically motivated in the past. However, he does not offer evidence of this, nor does he say which investigations and why. I am not only talking about the period when I was the head of the Slovenian Police, but also about the time when I was still the head of the Criminal Police Sector in Celje or later when I was the director of the Celje Police Administration. It is ironic that we hear criticism from the authorities that we have a political police force that needs to be depoliticised. ""
""The opposite is happening. It is this government that is playing a dangerous game by interfering in the work of the Police and political staffing. Another irony - although I am constantly associated with left-wing political parties, is that I was appointed head of the criminal police in Celje during the Janša government in 2005. I also later became the director of the Celje Police Administration under the right-wing government. The pogrom against me began later when I became the director general of the police during the left-wing government. ""
'NPU lived up to expectations'
A real pogrom is also happening over the National Investigation Office, which took place at the time when Janko Goršek was the Director General of the Police. ""The NPU was set up to investigate the most serious forms of crime, especially economic and corruption. It was not intended to count crimes, the amount of material damage and the seizure of illicit proceeds were important. These were the main reasons for setting up this unit. data published over a period of ten years, when the NPU dealt with around 1,300 suspected criminal offenses, filed criminal charges for 860 offenses and found 1.4 billion in damages, while providing another 350 million euros in confiscation of property, and 70 per cent of the investigations were launched on their own initiative, results that fully met the expectations of the profession. ""
""And no political party had immunity, criminals investigated both left and right politicians and their associates. Today in parliament we hear accusations of how investigators specialized only in prosecuting right-wing politicians, how they are part of a deep state and the like. however, it is surprising that under the current leadership, this unit is engaged in protests. ""
Dreams of a deep state
""The statements of politicians are frivolous when they talk about how to depoliticize the NPU, because it is too focused on dealing with right-wing parties, and applaud when criminal charges hit the left-wing political option. and the National Bureau of Investigation is in order, the investigations are legal and justified, but when members of the right-wing political option are charged or under investigation, then depoliticisation of the Police is needed, investigations are biased, illegal and politically oriented, and the Police are part of a deep state. everything in management positions needs to be replaced. ""
""The police simply cannot function in this way and must not receive such political treatment, nor all these pressures. Unfortunately, this is also the case when dealing with protests. As is well known, the leaders of the Ljubljana Police Department have already received warnings about dismissal due to the protests, which, in my opinion, is completely unfounded. ""
'It's unbelievable that trade unionists are threatened with charges'
Goršek says that it is unbelievable that the leadership of the Police wants to discipline even trade unionists and therefore threatens them with criminal charges and labor law measures. ""It is unacceptable to interfere with trade union rights and restrict the functioning of both police unions. I really can't imagine that someone is taking these rights. when I was CEO, in recent years it has become clear that it is the unions that have improved the position and status of employees. ""
""The leadership of the Police and the Interior Ministry should be aware of the importance of social dialogue with both unions. Not to attack them. Such attempts to discipline police unions are unacceptable and inappropriate. I am surprised that the Police leadership does not protect them even when politicians The task of the director general is to protect the reputation and integrity of employees, but one also gets the feeling that all the changes in police legislation that we are witnessing are not intended to improve the organization of work, but rather that all decision-making power directs the Director General and thus strengthens the influence of politics or the Minister of the Interior. ""
From murder investigations, extreme violence and terrorism to the director general
After graduating from the Cadet School for Militiamen in 1984, Janko Goršek got a job as a militiaman at the then Bežigrad Militia Station. After completing his studies at the College of Internal Affairs, two years later he got a job as a criminal investigator at the Police Administration in Celje. He was in the group for blood and sexual offenses, which also includes investigations into murders. Later, he was the head of the group for extreme violence and terrorism, as well as the head of the Department for Organized Crime at the Celje administration. In 2001 he went to the General Police Administration in Ljubljana, where he was the head of the Property Crime Department.
After four years, he returned to Celje as the head of the criminal police, replacing Robert Mravljak. In 2008, he already sat on the director's chair of this administration, but he did not stay long, as he was appointed director general of the Slovenian Police the following year. In October 2012, he left this position and went to become a police attaché in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he remained for five years. Prior to his retirement, he served in the General Police Administration, first in the Office of the Director General, then as an advisor to the Director.
“Although I also had the title of Adviser to the Director General of the Police last year, let me say that I did not have access to any electronic mailbox in the Police for the whole year, which means I was cut off from all the information I should have in this position. "" Goršek is also a veteran of the war for Slovenia.
'Police have lost their reputation, citizens don't trust them more than they used to'
Janko Goršek, 56, interpreted the end of his career in the Police in a completely different way. ""I am retiring with a bitter aftertaste, mainly because of the situation in which the police find themselves. The consequences of political interference are already visible in opinion polls. the reputation we have been striving for for thirty years.The relations between our colleagues are rather strained, mutual trust is broken, we are divided into those who are loyal to this house and profession and those who are primarily loyal and likeable to the ruling politicians. they spread untruths and misinformation about the employees with whom the government is accountable, thus gaining political points for their personal gain. ""
""Let me emphasize that these are my personal opinions and conclusions based on 38 years of experience in this house and on the basis of many conversations with colleagues who have approached me in the last year. By no means are my statements intended to do so, to insult anyone or damage the reputation of the Police. As already mentioned, I have never served any political option, I have not done any favors to any political party. It will remain so. I am not interested in politics and I do not intend to engage in such activities. ""
""Of course, I have to get used to the status of a pensioner first, this is only the first week. I will dedicate my free time to family and friends. There will be more time to spend with my daughter and son, and the sweetest will definitely be playing cards with my grandchildren."""

China.","The 13-million-strong city has been tightly closed since Dec. 23 as it faces the worst coronavirus outbreak in the country after Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic. But local authorities have faced public resistance for incompetence and disproportionately harsh measures that critics say harm the lives of those they are supposed to protect.
In the last two weeks, Chinese social networks have been flooded with posts by residents saying they have not received food, basic supplies or even health care - a picture of local government dysfunction while local officials are being pressured to limit covid-19 just weeks before the big lunar New Year holidays and the Beijing Winter Olympics.
One user reported that a highly pregnant woman was hospitalized on New Year's Eve because she did not have a valid covid-19 test. A video released on January 3 shows a woman sitting in front of a hospital with a pool of blood around her legs. Two hours later, she was only admitted to the hospital, but she had a miscarriage, said the user, who is said to be the niece of the pregnant woman. The post, which was posted on China’s microblogging platform Weibo, was massively shared before it was deleted. An employee of the hospital, Sjan Gaoxin, where the woman sought care, said the incident was being investigated and that the hospital initially rejected the woman in accordance with government regulations regarding covida-19, but declined to say more.
On Xiaohongsh, a Chinese platform similar to Instagram, a user asked for help on Sunday after a local hospital refused to admit her father, who had just suffered a heart attack because they lived in a medium-risk area of ​​the city. She later updated the post, saying her father was allowed emergency surgery when his condition worsened after a few hours. ""The delay was too long and the rescue failed. I no longer have a father,"" she wrote. The woman posted the event in more detail on Weib on Wednesday night. Her emotional record immediately went viral, garnering 630,000 likes and being shared more than 110,000 times by Thursday.
Another video posted online shows a woman in a quarantine hotel on New Year’s Day asking a covid control worker for sanitary pads. In a post viewed tens of millions of times before her removal, the woman said she tried to call several government departments to ask them for sanitary pads - to no avail. The woman later announced that she had received supplies from quarantine workers and said she regretted recording the original video.
Shocking posts sparked outbursts of compassion and anger online, with many questioning the significance of sacrificing in the name of controlling the epidemic. ""Nobody cares what you die of - unless it's a covid-19,"" one Weib user posted.
Following a public protest, Sjan officials told a news conference Wednesday that hospitals should not use the excuse to prevent and control the epidemic to avoid treating patients, including critical patients such as pregnant women. On Thursday, they also announced that the general manager of the hospital, Sjan Gaoxin, had been suspended, and the staff involved in the incident had been fired. The hospital was also instructed to apologize to the public. The city's ruling Communist Party's disciplinary supervisor also issued an internal warning to the head of the health commission, Sjan, and two other public health officials.
But these actions failed to quell the outrage. On Weib, the best-rated comment below the state media coverage of certain penalties is, ""It just shows that covid-19 may not kill you, but bureaucrats may."""

Where will the deputies go?","The search for pre-election alliances and political havens continues on the political scene. DeSUS, or what is left of it, will obviously fall apart once and for all. According to our information, therefore, Nova Slovenija could strengthen in particular. Robert Golob will be looking for common ground with the green party Vesna before the meeting with the parties of the Kul coalition, which is scheduled for next week.","Robert Golob continues to look for a way to enter the political arena. On the one hand, he is working with public tribunes: next week there will be a discussion in Maribor about what kind of country we want, followed by thematic discussions, for example on the environment. At the same time, he gets along with many political actors. On Thursday, for example, he will meet with representatives of the Vesna party. Both sides emphasize that this is a cognitive meeting, conversation and exchange of views on the political space. Next week, Golob is expected to hold talks with representatives of the Kul coalition parties.
The pre-election dynamics are expected to be the most intense on this line this month. The four parties of the Kul coalition have signed a post-election agreement. Is there enough room for Golob? How will Igor Zorčič approach Kula with his new party, after he was offered asylum there after leaving the Janša coalition, but did not accept it at that time?
Where will the desus deputies go?
Due to this event, the unaffiliated deputy Jurij Lep has practically stopped the already agreed transfer to LMŠ for now, as new possibilities are opening up. However, they are finally separating in the DeSUS parliamentary group. Branko Simonovič says that after the referendum in Izola this weekend, he will probably end the story with Desus. He does not yet know exactly where he will go, but he is also in talks with Nova Slovenija. Minister of Agriculture Jože Podgoršek is expected to be even closer to moving to New Slovenia, and more will be revealed next week. It will soon be known whether the leader of this parliamentary group, Jožef Horvat, will continue his political path.
""Some are making final decisions right now, but of course we will also listen - I can say - to the voice of the people in cases where they are so good at their work, so tested that we really want to have them on the list,"" said Janez Cigler Kralj of NSi.
Another extraordinary Desus MP, Ivan Hršak, says that something extraordinary should happen in order to run for parliament again, while Robert Polnar is expected to join the SNS. The DeSUS party, which has completely separated from the deputies, is looking for other ways to enter parliament. First of all, they are looking for this possibility with Igor Zorčič's party."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/cigler-kralj-predlaga-zvisanje-minimalne-place-na-107443-evra.html,"Cigler Kralj proposes raising the minimum wage to 1,074.43 euros","After the second consultation with the social partners, the Minister of Labor Janez Cigler Kralj announced that the adjustment of the minimum wage for 2022 will be equal to the level of growth in consumer prices last year. It is therefore expected to increase by 4.9 percent to 1,074.43 euros gross. Meanwhile, employers find the proposed increase in the minimum wage too high.","In accordance with the Minimum Wage Act, the minimum wage is adjusted at least annually to the growth of consumer prices. In line with existing macroeconomic forecasts, uncertainty over the covida-19 epidemic and after consulting with the social partners, the minister decided to align the minimum wage with official data on inflation last year, the Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Affairs said. and equal opportunities.
According to the above, the new amount of the gross minimum wage is expected to amount to EUR 1,074.43. The amount is expected to be published in the Official Gazette by 20 January and will be valid for the payment of work performed from 1 January onwards.
Employers find the proposed increase in the minimum wage too high
Raising the minimum wage by almost five percent means a great additional burden on the economy, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia (GZS) warns. They find the increase particularly high for many companies in energy-intensive activities and small businesses. They propose partial subsidies and changes in social contributions.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry reminded that the minimum wage had risen by 8.9 percent last year, while December's annual inflation was negative, with prices falling by 1.1 percent compared to December 2019. As a result, the minimum wage rose by a tenth in real terms last year.
They pointed out that we are already at the top in the EU in terms of the ratio between the minimum and average wage, and that the minimum wage instrument is playing its role, as the at-risk-of-poverty rate for employees in 2019 is 3.4%, which is 15 - times less than for the unemployed.
The Chamber of Craft and Entrepreneurship of Slovenia (OZS) has fewer concerns. On the sidelines of a meeting with journalists in Ljubljana, its president Branko Meh said that they were in favor of decent wages for people working in crafts and entrepreneurship.
""We at OZS are always for decent wages for decent work. We are not so much concerned with the minimum wage, but we understand large companies for which raising the minimum wage by five or ten percent means a lot. Some warn that if there is such a rise. come before, they are also forced to lay off, ""he said before the minister's announcement that the minimum wage would increase by 4.9 percent this year.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry estimates that many companies will find it difficult to bear such a rise in the minimum wage. In 2021, the prices of raw materials, petroleum products and later electricity and natural gas increased sharply, which had a major impact on raising entry prices for companies and will significantly complicate operations in the current year.
The amount of the minimum wage adjustment is determined by the Minimum Wage Act, at least in the amount of inflation. According to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the state expects that the state will give up additional revenues from raising the minimum wage in 2021 and will allocate part of the increase in the form of a subsidy in the lump sum of 30 euros per employee per month to the most affected companies.
According to the executive director of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mitja Gorenšček, this would give companies some time to harmonize sales prices and adjust operations to higher costs. Otherwise, the minimum wage could be further increased with the adoption of the proposed amendment to the Personal Income Tax Act, they reminded, adding that this could significantly increase purchasing power and stabilize domestic demand even in the event of a deteriorating epidemiological picture.
In addition, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry proposes that from 1 March to the end of 2022 a lower basis for calculating social security contributions of employees than specified in the Pension Act, in the amount of the new minimum wage, apply.
Left: It is necessary to recalculate the cost of living and raise the minimum wage
""Minister Janez Cigler Kralj did not decide to raise the minimum wage, as he claims today, but merely complied with the legal obligation to harmonize the minimum wage with inflation,"" the Left responded. ""According to the law, he could have followed the proposal of the unions and the opposition's calls to adjust the minimum wage to rising living costs, but he did not. The biggest success of the Left's proposal, which ensured long-term growth of the minimum wage stating that the minimum wage in the net amount must be at least 20 percent more than the minimum cost of living.The last calculation of the minimum cost of living was made in 2017 and at 613 euros does not correspond to the current situation. If the current obsolete minimum cost of living were adjusted from 2017 to 2021 at least with inflation, it would be € 678.7 today, which would mean that the minimum wage would have to be at least € 814.4 net or 1173.3 euros gross, ""they said in a press release.
They emphasized that poverty among full-time employees was unacceptable. The latest data from the statistical office show that 254,000 people live below the at-risk-of-poverty threshold, of which almost 46,000 are employed. More than 7,000 full-time employees therefore receive financial social assistance in addition to their salary, the party warns. ""This means that the state indirectly subsidizes companies that do not provide wages that workers can live on. Such a policy of subsidizing private capital continues to promote a policy of low wages and the worst forms of capitalist exploitation."""

Prior to her, the Economist ranked Denmark according to the five criteria used. The SD, meanwhile, has prepared its own analysis. They say that Slovenia is far from successful in the battle with the pandemic.","Analysts at the reputable liberal British weekly used five criteria to rank, comparing values ​​from the last quarter of 2019 and last year's third quarter, or the period for which the latest available data is available.
The first criterion is real GDP growth, the second real growth of disposable income of households, the third growth of share prices according to the most relevant stock exchange index, the fourth growth of fixed capital formation and the fifth growth of net public debt as a share of GDP.
According to the calculation based on these five factors, Denmark took the first place, Slovenia was second, and Sweden, Norway and Chile were in the top five. In addition to them, the top ten included Ireland, Poland, the Netherlands, the United States, Australia and Canada.
Austria, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and Spain are at the bottom of the top five.
In Slovenia, the Economist reported 1.2% real GDP growth, 10.1% real growth in household disposable income, 33% growth in the value of the stock index, 6.8% growth in fixed capital formation and an increase in Slovenia. net public debt as a share of GDP by 7.4 percentage points.
The SD is convinced that Slovenia is not among the winners
Meanwhile, the SD believes that Slovenia is not among the economic winners of the epidemic. ""Especially because the situation of individuals is not better than it was before the epidemic, and because we have accumulated a large debt that we will pay for decades. Because we have not made any development or structural breakthrough, but in Slovenia it is spending ten or more billion in three years - for giving pre-election candies. And that money will have to be returned, ""says Milan M. Cvikl, chairman of the SD's Finance, Development and Cohesion Policy Council.
""The first selected indicator shows that we have 1.2% GDP growth, which is mainly due to the continuation of borrowing in 2021, the acceleration of domestic consumption, which was financed from public sources by high payments of health care supplements and elsewhere. (65 percent and more on salaries) and transfers, which are increasingly in the form of pre-election sweets, and this growth is not much better than in other countries, but structurally unsustainable, so we have one of the worst structural general government deficits. households per capita, which did increase by an average of 10.1 percent, but this is mainly due to higher growth in government-financed households, ie allowances or wage growth in the public sector or generated in financial or monopoly services Let us not forget that the real value of these revenues is affected by inflation, as confirmed by the latest Surs data on wages, which say that in October 2022 the average wages are higher in nominal terms and lower in real terms. In other words, it is a one-off, short-term increase in personal consumption financed by government borrowing, which has a faster impact on the growth of consumption, rather than a rise in wages based on what is created in the economy. This is the wrong policy. The third indicator reflects the inflating of the shallow stock market, which is not something to be proud of, because it is the result of the commitment of NLB, d. d. that it has to pay high dividends, changes in the margin policies of the state at Petrol, d. d., which is why we are paying for more expensive petrol and, of course, rising pharmacy stock prices, which is a reflection of the pandemic. The fourth indicator, 6.8 percentage points higher investment growth, is the result of started projects that have been prepared for many years in all previous governments, and of course the construction boom. The fifth indicator is the growth of public debt in GDP, which, according to the presented data, is expected to be only 7.4 percentage points higher in the third quarter of 2021 and at the end of 2019. However, this figure is not accurate, the real figure is twice the growth of the debt-to-GDP ratio of 14 percent, ""he explains.
""If it were true that the government has more fiscal space than it really has, it would now officially declare an epidemic, implement measures to mitigate energy inflation, reduce VAT and introduce energy vouchers. But all this is not, we only have selective measures in pre-election purposes and for selected groups, ""the SD said."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/zda-uvedle-sankcije-proti-dodiku-in-televizijski-mrezi.html,The United States has imposed sanctions on Dodik and his television network,The United States has imposed sanctions on Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik and his associated television network for threatening the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region as a whole. He has been accused of threatening the fragile 25-year Dayton Peace Accords with his secessionist moves. Dodik responded to the sanctions and said he could not be disciplined.,"""Milorad Dodik's destabilizing corrupt activities and attempts to break the Dayton Peace Accords, fueled by his own interests, threaten the stability of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the entire region,"" said Brian Nelson, undersecretary of terrorism and intelligence at the US Treasury Department.
""(Dodik's) disruptive ethnonationalist rhetoric reflects his efforts to achieve these political goals and to divert attention from his corrupt activities,"" the ministry added.
Sanctions include blocking all funds available to Dodik under U.S. jurisdiction and criminalizing transactions with him under U.S. law. Sanctions have also been imposed on Alternative Television, a Banja Luka television network owned by a company linked to Dodik's son.
Today, Dodik denied violating BiH's constitutional order. “If you think you can discipline me in this way, you are wrong,” he responded to the sanctions. ""Now I have an even better motive to fight for the rights we have been denied for 26 years,"" he added to the SRNA news agency.
The political situation in BiH has worsened after former international representative Valentin Inzko decided to amend the BiH Penal Code shortly before his resignation, with a new prison sentence of six months to five years for denying genocide. This angered Dodik, who announced a series of measures by the Serbian entity.
Dodik described the united BiH as a failure and announced the withdrawal of the Republika Srpska from a number of central BiH institutions. The Republika Srpska parliament then passed a proposal in December, despite warnings from the West, obliging the local government to transfer powers in the military, taxes and the judiciary from the state to the entity level in the next six months. The European Commissioner for Enlargement, Hungarian Oliver Varhelyi, blamed Inzko's move for the aggravation of the situation.
The Bosnian Prosecutor's Office has launched an investigation against Dodik and 12 other people due to a well-founded suspicion of a criminal offense of attacking the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their goal was to change the constitutional order of BiH, overthrow its highest institutions and reduce the defense power of BiH, reads the justification of the investigation. Dodik is also accused of attempting to form an army illegally.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban recently expressed support for the Serbian representative in BiH. Orban described Dodik as a democratically elected politician and warned the West that the exorcism of Dodik, who wants to separate Republika Srpska from BiH, would be very dangerous, adding that Hungary would block any attempt at sanctions against him in the EU. He promised Banja Luka 100 million euros in aid.
In November, the Prime Minister of Slovenia, Janez Janša, also met with Dodik at an unannounced meeting in Ljubljana. At the working dinner, the two leaders discussed the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnian media described Dodik's visit to the Slovenian capital as a diplomatic-right-wing offensive."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/svet/pomankanje-ustreznega-kadra-v-sloveniji-tezave-tudi-na-smuciscih.html,"According to forecasts, there will be a shortage of staff in an incredible 108 professions this year","Unemployment in Slovenia is less than 5%, the Employment Service says that more than 65,000 people are looking for work, and there are a little more than 3,000 jobs available. But these are just numbers, and the reality in many industries is that employers say they don’t get good workers, or better yet, that there are no workers at all. We are talking about construction workers, tourism workers, caterers, butchers, teachers, medical staff, drivers and many others. As many as 180 professions do not have enough suitable staff. And so, even in the middle of the winter season on the ski slopes, they struggle with where to get people to work.","More than half of Slovenian employers now face a lack of suitable staff, including, not surprisingly, ski resorts. ""If I think that 70,000 people are unemployed on the stock exchange, but we can't get one waiter here, one cable car operator who doesn't need to have an education, I don't know what is going on together,"" says Janez Janša from RTC Krvavec. Not only cable car operators, but according to the Employment Service, there will be a shortage of staff in an incredible 108 professions this year. For example, there are fewer and fewer pharmacists, masons, builders and waiters.
Nina Valant from Lačni Kekec in Kranjska Gora explains: ""In principle, we also help each other by having people from Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia. we get people very quickly. The guests don't mind in principle, because the waiters learn Slovene really fast, or at least try hard "".
However, such an effort can by no means be enough to hire the already mentioned cable car operators, who have to go through the training process for their work. According to the president of their association, there are too few Slovenian cable car operators from year to year. ""Mainly because the cable car operator must know and master the Slovenian language. Operating the device, communicating with colleagues is the first thing that is absolutely necessary for the cable car device to operate safely. The cable car operator must know the device, must have experience, so it is necessary to educate these workers in the long run, ""adds Manuela Božič Badalič from the Association of Slovenian Cable Car Operators. But there are no quick fixes for acquiring the necessary cableway skills.
With appropriate working conditions and rewards, Božič adds, it is necessary to ensure that workers do not flee to other industries, and above all, the use of social transfers should be prevented. Janša says that the employment policy is absolutely wrong at the state level. The 33,000 announced new jobs on the labor market with a shortage of staff therefore do not predict better times, so decisions to solve these problems will have to be made quickly."
https://www.24ur.com/popin/zanimivosti/astrologinja-o-letu-2022.html,Astrological forecast: 2022 will be a year of change - whoever knows how to adapt will be successful,"According to psychological astrology, the year 2022 will bring many opportunities, and the main motive will be ambition. There will be a new ideology. It will take a lot of adaptation and learning. It will be necessary to adapt to new jobs, learn new skills, open up to new knowledge, foreign languages. Whoever knows how to adapt quickly will have a successful year, whoever is late will no longer be able to ""catch up"" with the world. The pandemic will end in February 2023. ""Let's not expect life to be the way it was before the pandemic. By adapting, we will have a 'new normal state' with periodic shocks in one form or another only after 2025,"" he predicts.","According to psychological astrologist Teodora Erhatič, there was a lot more work with clients in need of psychotherapy during the epidemic - mainly due to distress, fear and difficult family relationships. ""Since I have been working in astrological counseling for 22 years and in psychotherapy for 15 years, I have many regular clients. However, I noticed that people did not seek advice during lockdown periods or major bans, and in my opinion not because it was there is a lot of fear and uncertainty and more concern about how they will survive financially. ""
According to her, after a long period of introspection, we can expect the beginning of a new life cycle in 2022. We have a much more ""normal"" year ahead of us than the last two.
Tell us for a start, what awaits us in 2022? Will next year be any better?
The year 2022 will be marked by unpleasant events and changes. Specifically, the changes have already begun with the last square between Saturn and Uranus (December 22, 2021) and the shift of karmic Moon nodes from Gemini and Sagittarius to Taurus and Scorpio (December 23, 2021) and will continue in the future. summer. Next year, bull and scorpion themes such as privacy, intimacy, security, wealth and art will be highlighted.
Humanity is facing a huge transformation, and in the first few weeks after the new year, circumstances will emerge that will make it clear that 2022 will be no easier. Families will be at risk, as many have spent the last two years at home and their livelihoods have been threatened. In 2022, many will have to make extremely important decisions that will greatly change their lives. Unpleasant circumstances, however, will force most of us to make a final decision, but let us not be afraid of change, as they are the only constant in our lives. Even the worst times bring many good things.
Of course, 2022 will bring many opportunities, and ambition will be the main motive. A new ideology will happen. It is not necessary that the new ideology will be positive, it can only be a new attempt to control people. It will take a lot of adaptation and learning. It will be necessary to adapt to new jobs, learn new skills, open up to new knowledge, foreign languages. Anyone who can adapt quickly will have a successful year. The strategy will have to be drafted at the beginning of the year. Whoever is late will no longer be able to ""catch up"" with the world. I am also announcing a major technological revolution and progress. A lot of knowledge will see the light of day, there will be new discoveries, innovations, automation, technology, people's awareness will rise and spirituality will deepen. The changes will spread to all segments of our lives and across the planet.
What interests me the most is - what awaits us in connection with the epidemic? Will we finally see its end?
My view is that the pandemic will end at the end of February 2023. This is because it started when Saturn entered Aquarius (end of 2019) and will end when Saturn leaves this sign. A few astrologers, myself included, have predicted that the world will experience quite a few upheavals towards the end of 2019 and all the way to the end of 2022! And in the last two years, the world has really undergone a lot of changes. With the entry of Jupiter in the sign of Pisces on December 29, 2021 and until April 2022, we will see that the universe offers us a break. It will be important, however, to leave enough space to deal with what makes us happy, motivates and awakens us.
What about travel and holidays - will we finally be able to breathe more freely?
The main theme of this year will be change. Nevertheless, the energy of the sky will be generous and optimistic, so quite a few people will be able to afford longer trips until May 2022. The bans will slowly ease, as in the fall of 2021 until the end of January 2022, there will be no more. Travel will be even more interesting as it will become a priority during this time. Since Saturn is still in Aquarius, it will seem to some that everything is happening very slowly, but precisely because Aquarius symbolizes independence, hope, freedom, I would say that Saturn in this sign actually breaks more restrictions, prohibitions and brings the realization that people can socialize, come together, and become increasingly innovative. From May until October 2022, there is a drastic reduction in covid-19 and other infections, most will return to everyday joys, we will begin to make up for lost time. After years of tightening travel restrictions, we will consider the important impact of travel on health and well-being, as we are already finding that travel helps (but does not necessarily take long) mental and emotional health more than other forms of rest and relaxation.
There will be parliamentary elections in April. The outlines of new customers and faces are already showing. Can we expect big changes in this area?
According to stellar insights, I can predict a somewhat calm time until April 2022 and significant problems from May to the end of October 2022. For now, we will have to deal with economic problems, which will ease somewhat in the first half of the year and will be under control. negative trends will be slightly less noticeable. The political horizon of our turbulent world will look relatively quiet, there will be a trend of recurring relations in the direction of war and peace. But with May 2022, things will suddenly change. Negative confrontations will lead to unrest, non-recognition, crises and war. This coincides with the transition of Jupiter from neutral fish to a combative, rude ram. The political scene will become difficult again and some parties will not honor their agreements. This could become an extremely challenging period, as Uranus, a planet of sudden change and unexpected events, will be at the same stage of the bull as it was in 1938, which was a fateful year for the whole world. From an astrological point of view, this was the event that triggered World War II.
What about the economy and borrowing. Anti-crown measures have taken their toll - who will be the worst?
It is impossible to talk about the global economic prospects for 2022 without tackling the proverbial elephant in the china room: inflation. For decades, significant price increases have been avoided in most major markets. Then, the sudden recession due to covid-19, with long-term supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, created a storm in price increases. Let’s not expect life to be the way it was before the pandemic. By adjusting, we will have a ""new normal state"" with periodic skunks in one form or another only after 2025. In the first three months from January to the end of March 2022, the country seems to be dealing with domestic issues in the fields of economy, health, agriculture, energy sources such as oil, gas, petroleum chemicals, politics and the like. The year 2022 will be marked by a high outflow of money in the face of health problems, unforeseen obligations or coercion, which may involve the military or political action. The economy will slow as the country transforms its economic machine by deflating its real estate sector and reinvesting in sectors that drive “stable growth”. Greater problems are due to the lack of skilled labor, the euro crisis, rising food prices, logistical complications and rising living costs. There is a slow recovery in the services sector, which will have a negative impact on the economy. In the second half of the year, we may even enter a period of stagflation or recessionary inflation, which has not been observed since the 1970 energy crisis.
In the long run, the negative consequences of over-reliance on technology and its use are evident. Excessive use and dependence on it, affects false information, reduced attention (illusion), increased medical conditions, both physical (obesity) and mental (increased mental disorders) and the impact on brain functions. Despite the government’s attempts to silence the voices of civil society advocating for gender equality and women’s rights, social media will remain an important platform for women to raise awareness of the ongoing issues they face and potentially drive change.
If we touch on the world scale - do you see any major upheavals, changes, disasters abroad?
Next year, climate change will continue to wreak havoc around the world, as Jupiter and Neptune, which will meet (conjunction) in the sign of Pisces, bring many floods, worse than we have seen so far. The last time their conjunction took place was on March 17, 1856. Volcanic activity will also increase and earthquakes await us. I also see that in the period from May to the end of September 2022, more fires will break out in our country and around the world, causing great losses, both ecological and human lives.
We are witnessing and will continue to escalate military tensions. Unfortunately, this is just the beginning of what is to come. Conflicts will intensify in the second half of 2022, weakening NATO countries. Countries suffering from economic instability will experience changes in government, if not complete political chaos. China and Russia will strengthen, which could continue in 2023 or 2024. Many countries will experience protests and riots, and people will resist the authorities.
Many changes will also be influenced by the karmic planets, which have moved from the signs of Gemini and Sagittarius to the signs of Taurus and Scorpio. Most know them as the North and South Nodes of the Moon, they are also called Rahu and Ketu. This means that all of this year’s eclipses will take place in these two signs, bringing powerful trials and upheavals for all of us, and for some, insights related to security, values, and our most intimate relationships, both love and family. The eclipses will further intensify major shifts and changes. While eclipses in Taurus indicate a certain shift in finances - perhaps in the world of cryptocurrencies, eclipses in the sign of Scorpio will work on deeper and more repressed emotions. As transiting Uranus is still in Taurus, chaos, unexpected events (both positive and negative, depending on the natal chart) and excitement will continue in 2022. Life can get faster than desired as Uranus destroys the need for stability. The choices, while surprising to others, may seem credible and appropriate to us as we navigate new priorities and ways of expressing ourselves. However, the changes we will try to avoid will become increasingly difficult under the influence of Uranus, so let’s just boldly step into them.
But what are the predictions for individual astrological signs? What can they look forward to and what should certain signs be careful about?
It’s time to say goodbye to 2021 and say goodbye to 2022! There are several key astrological events waiting for us that can affect our lives in interesting ways. However, it is important to know how, where, why and in what way 2022 will affect us, from our natal astrological chart. Let's look at each sign separately.
Aries will progress in all respects, which includes achieving greater fitness. You will be more focused on how to make the best use of energy to achieve the desired results. The ability to communicate with people will come to light and this year you will learn to be calm and wait for the right moment to take action. Your finances will be stable throughout the year, you will learn to save and spend rationally. Given that your priority will be to develop yourself and take care of yourself, mentally and spiritually, this can help you feel more focused and even more able to set boundaries that will serve as a foundation for fulfilled relationships, whether business or romantically colored.
Bulls be ready for change soon after the new year. You will have planetary support if you are planning a wedding, family expansion or living together. Single you will focus on yourself, on your goals, you will study relationships with friends, try to strengthen relationships with relatives. Love can come to you spontaneously. In the second half of 2022, most of you will focus on career advancement and creating a stable financial position. No matter how complicated it seems, don’t despair! In financial terms, it would be good to make big purchases in the first half of the year, but be rational in the second half and save money by investing in improving or starting a private business.
The twins have been searching for the meaning of life for the last two years and getting to know the deepest parts of themselves. If you have used this period for personal development, you can now rest and consider yourself a mature, stable person. You will realize that the family together with your partner is your greatest support and at the same time you will realize how important it is to maintain stable family relationships and nurture them day by day. Many of you will find that long-term safe service does not make you happy and in some way does not satisfy you. Jupiter will give you the strength to make your dreams come true and change jobs. The stars say you are fighting for your goals, but stay grounded, listen to suggestions from co-workers, experienced business people to avoid further complications.
Cancers look forward to a year in which you focus on family, friends, travel and enjoyment. It gives you a chance to take a break from the problems, obligations and delays you tried to solve in 2021. The stars are in your favor this time, so take advantage of them for rest and variety. You will have great creative potential and your imagination will be lush in 2022, which is an ideal state if you love writing, painting, spirituality and other arts. Make a savings plan in the first half of the year, and especially in the summer, spending should be rational so that there is no financial collapse at the end of August. Your health will be stable and you need to be disciplined to solve the health problems you have been facing for years.
The left will mark the year 2022 with a solar and lunar eclipse, which will affect your career and family. You can expect changes and temptations this year. You need to clearly define your path and talk honestly with yourself. If your desires and needs do not crystallize in 2022, you will be driven by turbulent changes. Therefore, it is better to be prepared for bad events, as well as good opportunities, to make the most of them. In the coming year, you will learn how to become more determined, how to make quick and correct decisions that will affect your partner and the whole family this time. Your health will be stable as you have acquired healthy habits, you have learned to listen to your body and its needs.
Virgos can advance in their jobs and careers if you have been in the same position for a long time. Be aware of your knowledge and the fact that your customers and the people you work with love you. Specifically, they love your energy and that you transfer your knowledge and skills through conversation. The field of communication will be active throughout 2022 and in cooperation with the people around you you can achieve personal and business goals. The past year has been turbulent and has brought a lot of quarrels in relationships, if you have remained committed to your partner, try to awaken passion in 2022 and enjoy the romantic moments you miss. Learn to share the good and the bad with your loved one and it will be time to connect on a much deeper level.
Libra awaits issues of selling inherited property, buying property and remodeling a home. You will focus on events in the outside world, all to take care of the family. Don’t go to the other extreme and don’t forget to show your partner tenderness and romance. Your focus on finances will mark the whole year, you will have the opportunity to save more money and thus ensure further investment. You will be determined in the business world, you have learned rationality. You will be active in the field of social relations and many of you will decide on humanitarian work next year. Health will be stable all year round, it can only be shaken by negative emotions that you hide under the rug.
Scorpios have the opportunity to start something you have wanted for a long time, but you were not confident enough. You will make decisions that will change your life path. Many Scorpios have had to be rational because of various events over the years. Now you can take a break and focus on the creative potential you have within you. Many of you will pay attention to your hobbies as you can also cash in on them. You will not have any major financial problems next year. You have learned to allocate money properly and therefore you will feel safe. Consider going to the gym or running to release excess energy. Activities in nature or by the water will further strengthen your creative energy and immunity.
Shooters have long been focused on work and gaining material security. The coming year brings you peace and free time, which you can spend smiling, enjoying your hobbies and socializing more. Over the past year, it has become clear to you who your true friends are, and if you have not broken off toxic relationships, you will be forced into it in the first half of 2022. Free Sagittarians will want a stable relationship, settle down and then dedicate themselves to a partner. In the search for a soul mate, however, don’t let yourself be overwhelmed by the sweet story of the opposite sex, follow the actions of the people you meet. Many Sagittarians will be happy with the greater financial gain you have been waiting for, you may receive a raise or bonus, you can take a trip as a gift from the company.
Capricorns will withdraw more inward and enjoy solitude and silence. The period until May will inspire you to start achieving your goals and desires. Throughout the year, your main challenge will be to communicate with other people, you will learn to be patient and thoughtful before making decisions. So far, you’ve had a habit of putting your ideas into action right away, which was catastrophic in most situations. Many Capricorns will test themselves in writing and working through social media. You will develop your ability to communicate and if you awaken inspiration or desire to write stories and songs, do not neglect it. Try to find a time of two to three weeks in early January and mid-summer, exclusively for the holidays.
Aquarius brings a lot of stress to Aquarius, so it is important that you dedicate more understanding to yourself and respect your values. To experience prosperity in the year to come, focus on building self-confidence and not diminishing your self-worth as new challenges arise. You will learn to cry on a friend’s shoulder in difficult times. Make a clear plan that will lead you to the realization of desires and do not deviate from it, no matter how much different offers may seem simpler and more acceptable. I am thinking mainly of work here! In the summer you will have the opportunity to travel and try out new skills and hobbies. Headaches and insomnia are possible due to the large amount of stress. Meditation will help!
Pisces will start moving the planets forward in January and February, so do something new and different. You haven’t taken the initiative in years, you haven’t had long-term and serious plans. The year 2022 will force you to move, re-examine your path you have taken. Your inner side will come to the fore, you will begin to make decisions and explore the world around you, and focus on learning. Use the first half of the year to explore yourself, your desires and interests. In the second part of the year, take concrete steps towards achieving your goals. Take care of your appearance, but do not overdo it, listen to your body. Don’t rush, control impulsive purchases and maintain good financial standing throughout the year.
In your opinion, what consequences will 2021 have for us?
After a long period of introspection, most can expect a new life cycle to begin. In the span of a year and a half, we have witnessed planetary shifts that have formed rare settlements that we have not experienced in years. However, I see that a much more “normal” year is ahead of us than the last two. We have entered the 200-year cycle of the air element era (last time we were 800 years ago) and so we have been given the opportunity to start (at least some of us) making shifts towards collaboration, networking, to raise awareness of how we live, how we co-create personal life and the life of the world. It will become clear to many that we have a collective responsibility, that our actions have consequences, and because we are all inhabitants of this planet, we need to work together to create a better tomorrow.
There is a feeling of hopelessness among people. It will be necessary to strengthen moral values, trust and take more care of health, as the past years have shown that everything seems self-evident to us and that many things must be at our fingertips. It encourages us all the time to look for ways to respond to what it brings. Thus, the time of the epidemic is also a time and opportunity to discover ourselves and the values ​​of society and to reflect on the meaning of life. Let us not be too proud and sure to hold all the threads of life in our hands. Perhaps, however, the Crown Epidemic will ground us and show us that wild capitalism, which produces to infinity and persistently tells us that we cannot live without this or that, is wrong.

This will apply to those over the age of 12 and is expected by January 26, a few days before the return of schoolchildren to classrooms, the London government said. Montenegro, however, has tightened conditions for entering the country. According to the new law, only persons who have evidence of vaccination against covid-19 or illness can enter it, and at the same time they must submit a negative test result for a new coronavirus. France, meanwhile, is loosening quarantine rules in an effort to mitigate the impact on society and the economy.","The British government's action - a recommendation, not an obligation - is intended to ensure that as many students as possible are able to attend school for as long as possible. So far, the government has recommended that this age group wear masks in public school areas. The principals' association welcomed the new recommendation.
At the same time, the Ministry of Health announced the installation of an additional 7,000 air filters in classrooms. Teachers' unions criticize this number as too low.
In Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, the recommendation to wear masks in schools has been in place for a long time. Health policy in the United Kingdom is a matter for regional governments. England, which does not have its own government, is the responsibility of the central government in London.
In the UK, omicron is spreading at a high rate, leading to a sharp increase in the number of people infected with the new coronavirus. In England alone, more than 160,000 cases were confirmed on Saturday, the most so far for this part of the UK.
Montenegro tightened conditions for entering the country
As of today, Montenegro has tightened the conditions for entering the country. According to the new law, only persons who have evidence of vaccination against covid-19 or illness can enter Montenegro, and at the same time they must submit a negative test result for the new coronavirus.
In vaccinated people, no more than six months should have passed since the last dose of the vaccine. However, if a negative test is submitted, the PCR test can be up to 72 hours old and the rapid antigen test 48 hours old.
Citizens and foreigners with temporary residence can enter Montenegro without the proof, but they must undergo a ten-day quarantine, which can be terminated within three days with a negative PCR test, according to the Montenegrin Ministry of Health.
France is loosening quarantine rules
Meanwhile, France will loosen quarantine rules on Monday in an effort to mitigate the impact on society and the economy. Fully vaccinated against covid-19 who test positive for the new coronavirus will only need to be isolated for seven days, regardless of the version they are infected with.
At the same time, quarantine will be completed after five days in the case of a negative antigen or PCR test. For fully vaccinated after close contact with infected quarantine will not be at all, said in an interview with Le Journal du Dimanche Health Minister Olivier Veran.
For those infected who have not been vaccinated or have not yet received all the required doses, the ten-day quarantine rule remains in force, which can be completed with a negative test after seven days. Close contacts of those who have not been vaccinated must also be quarantined for seven days, and a negative test for infection is required to complete it.
As explained by the French Ministry of Health, the change responds to the needs of the extremely rapid spread of the coronavirus version of omicron. It is intended to strike a balance between benefits and risks, aimed in particular at ensuring control of the virus while preserving socio-economic life.
As they point out, the first data show that the incubation period for omicron is shorter than for other versions, which speaks in favor of reducing the quarantine time.
In France, more than 219,000 new cases of new coronavirus infection were confirmed on Saturday alone. The seven - day incidence of cases per 100,000 population is 1456.
In the country, a booster dose is required to meet the condition of full vaccination seven months after the initial two doses. This deadline will be reduced to four months from February 15, Veran announced.
As early as Monday, some tightening of measures to limit the spread of the new coronavirus will take effect in the country. Under the new law, the mask will be mandatory for all people over the age of six in several public places, including public transport. Until now, this rule has applied to people over 11 years of age.
In addition, it will be forbidden to serve food and drink on trains for three weeks. As of Friday, the mask is again mandatory in the open air."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/vecno-vracanje-istega-novi-obrazi-in-zmaga-pred-volitvami.html,Eternal return of the same - new faces and victory before the election,"For more than a year, the liberal political, economic and cultural elite has been frantically searching for a way to prevent Janez Janša and the SDS from winning and forming a new coalition after the 2022 elections. existing parliamentary and non-parliamentary parties (Čeferin, Zorčič, Leben, Vesel, etc.). In the end, Janša himself offered a solution for liberal circles.","Fourteen days ago, a ""founding"" meeting of the new political force took place in Kino Šiška. Robert Golob, the recently unconfirmed leader of Gen-I, has “openly” entered politics. Such statements are rather strange, as Golob has already been in politics - in various parties and in rather high positions. Various people took part in the presentation or public tribune, and the key message was that we live in a non-free country, which will be liberated with honesty and hope - of course - by the Liberals. The screenwriting performance of Golob together with Janez Janša's former close collaborator Tonet Krkovič the day after Golob's new term at the helm of Gen-I was not confirmed, already hinted that something more could probably develop from this story. And it developed exactly what many wanted so much - a “new face” emerged that obviously has both a strong political-economic background and popularity. Robert Golob became the savior of the liberals, the political savior before Janša.
Golob, who has already replaced three liberal parties (LDS, PS, SAB), is a politically recognizable and strong candidate according to various polls. His non-existent party is said to be second in the number of votes, just behind the SDS. Due to the extremely small possibility that the SDS would be able to form a new government after the April 2022 elections, it increasingly seems that Golob has been determined in advance as prime minister-designate. The political and economic content of Golob's project is - at least for now - the expulsion of fear, cooperation with the ""left"" and the ""right"", honesty, hope and technocracy. This is not a political program. What’s more, instead of a serious political organization, it currently offers activism and an undefined movement that is more reminiscent of self-help groups than a serious political story.
There are many parallels with the story of Zoran Janković in 2005 - a successful manager who was not at the will of the government under the leadership of Janez Janša, enters political waters and achieves great success. But at the time, Jankovic was a harbinger of the entry of management as the highest political virtue in politics, which resulted in many scandals and a consolidated capitalist status quo - of course emphasizing the importance of partisanship, which is synonymous with leftism. In the same way, we do not find any illiberal or non-capitalist content in Golob, but only a look back and anti-Janša sentiment. Who will support Golob does not matter - it has become clear that decades of (neo) liberal and neoconservative technocratization of politics and the expulsion of class conflict from the center of democracy are enough for people to support the manager with the mass support of the media. then he will also be good and successful in politics. Above all, it is important that he is Janša's opponent.
Golob's entry into politics brings many headaches for the Liberals, who have been trying for more than a year to replace Janez Janša and return us to pre-Jansk ""normalcy"". It is quite likely that Golob will win the most votes among the left liberal parties. This also undermines the formation of a coalition between the KUL parties in advance, as the balance of power between the political parties will be re-established. It is no longer necessary for all KUL parties to come to parliament at all, much less for all of them to take part in the post-election government. The rules of the game will probably be set by someone who is outside of KUL. New alliances are not ruled out either.
If Janša is not in power after the elections, we can expect empty boasts about returning to normalcy. The problem will be that this new normality at the level of words will mean the continuation of (neo) liberal policy before the Janša government. This return to normalcy and hope essentially means a reproduction of the (neo) liberal status quo, which was implemented by both liberal and conservative parties in Slovenia. This will maintain the conditions necessary for the return of Janša or similar politicians to power in the future.
The entire Slovenian politics has been reduced to a struggle of personalities - Antijanša vs. Janša - while according to historical experience they both strengthen the capitalist peripheral position of Slovenia. With a potential victory and / or at least a government composition led by Golob or anyone else in the KUL coalition, the opportunity for the left (not left liberal, progressive or any other Americanized liberal) alternative, anti-capitalist and therefore democratic will be missed again. politics. By agreeing to an extremely liberal policy and ""uniting"" in the fight against Janša, the left has somewhat forgotten about the class struggle, but according to its rhetoric and middle-class persuasion, it seems to have accepted the inevitability of class society and capitalism.
Pigeons, Ceraris, Sharks and other ""new faces"" do not represent world historical figures, but are merely the tragedy of attempts to liberalize the former LDS basin and part of the former communist bureaucratic nomenklatura. In Slovenia, we live in the farce of liberal politics, which cannot offer anything new except a ""new face"". So it's about replaying what you've already seen. There is really no alternative vision. New content - except for (self-) declared honesty and efficiency - is not offered by technology management circles and KUL clients. Unfortunately, in such a policy sworn to capitalism, in moments of high inflation and rising prices, there is unfortunately no possibility for either democratic politics or a decent life for the people."

He is preparing a new film project about the first Croatian president, Franjo Tuđman, which is supposed to be played by the infamous actor Spacey.","Kevin Spacey came to our neighbors at the invitation of the famous Croatian director Jakov Sedlar, who is currently working on a new project, and is preparing to shoot a film about the first Croatian president Franjo Tudjman. He is also said to have played Spacey, who, according to the Jutarnji list portal, even smiled at him in the lead role.
A few days ago, Sedlar confirmed for the mentioned media that negotiations are already underway with the famous player. He left for Paris on December 29, where negotiations began, and Spacey arrived in Zagreb yesterday, December 30, where he should stay for a while. But it has not yet been officially confirmed that Sedlar and Spacey have reached any agreement on filming.
All the details still remain shrouded in mystery and not even director Sedlar wants to talk too much about the project itself. He says that he does not want to rush like some of his colleagues, who announced in advance the shooting of their films with big stars, but there was no bread from this flour.
“We’re going slow, we’re negotiating and that’s all,” Sedlar was brief and concise.
It is known that the famous director has been saying for years that he wants to make a film about Franjo Tuđman as a person and his work, given that no feature film describing the first Croatian president has been made in Croatia.
Spacey is one of the most successful and best-known actors, remembered by audiences for his numerous roles in film as well as in series. In recent years, he has become famous for his role in the legendary television series House of Cards, where he played Frank Underwood, a politician who has nothing to stop him from advancing in American politics. However, his presence in the series was abruptly interrupted by scandals and allegations of sexual abuse. That's when his career went downhill ...
Spacey, a two-time Oscar winner, has been to Croatia twice before, and his visit to Hvar in 2008 was marked by wild parties.
The Hollywood star, who stayed at the Esplanade Hotel in Zagreb, will also use his visit to see the city, which is especially festive and magical this Advent and New Year's time. According to Croatian media, a short trip to Opatija is also planned, and it seems that the star will spend the New Year holidays with our neighbors and the Sedlar family."

She added that although they may also cooperate with the Coalition of the Constitutional Arc (KUL) on certain topics, they will let them know when they do not agree with their actions. ""We have already prepared leaflets that we will use when we do not agree with KUL's decisions. It will say: 'This is not KUL,'"" she said.","""A lot of people asked me if I would announce my candidacy today with LMŠ. I will not announce it. I was not even invited to do so, and if I were, I probably wouldn't be sitting here today,"" Kovač said. According to her, civil society can also engage with politics when fighting for the same goals. At the same time, they may be on opposite banks again on the next topic, she commented.
She explained that there are two views on civil society. The former sees civil society as pressure and the latter as a companion. She pointed out that civil society often fails to ask political parties for help, although when fighting for a common goal, they could. On the other hand, according to her, political parties also do not know how to approach civil society and ask them for help in activating civil society. As an example, she cited supplementary health insurance - an area in which they could participate.
The president of the LMŠ party, Marjan Šarec, also said that civil society and politics should go hand in hand. ""If the meeting is longer than 45 minutes, the meeting is not operational,"" is a sentence uttered by Kovacs, which remains in Šarc's memory. His opinion of her has changed because, as he says, he has seen that he actually wants to come to common solutions. In addition, the meeting let him know that a representative of civil society knows how to cooperate, but at the same time she can be critical.
""The term KUL is miserable and gets on our nerves""
She said that the task of civil society is to stand on the opposite side of the ruling or. fight the system. She added that they had already opposed previous governments when they acted against the interests of civil society, but that the government of Janez Janša went one step further. “This is now the first government when people are scared when they are actually scared,” she said. ""This is a government where there is corruption, a government that puts its people in positions and even normalizes police violence. When you talk to friends from Hungary and Belarus who are migrating en masse, you realize that our priority is to get back to where we are. they were already before the Janša government, although even then things were not ideal, ""she added.
She stressed that she would stay on the side of civil society. Although on some points they may also cooperate with the LMŠ and other opposition parties, they still intend to oppose government representatives when necessary. She revealed that the institute has even prepared leaflets in case the Coalition of the Constitutional Arc (KUL), consisting of LMŠ, Levica, SAB and SD, takes over the government and does something that would not be good for civil society. “We have prepared leaflets that say‘ This is not KUL ’,” she issued, adding that they find the name KUL miserable and get on their nerves. “The name is for older gentlemen over 50,” she joked.
They also answered questions from people who followed the broadcast of the conversation on Facebook. Among other things, they also addressed the Salonit Anhovo incinerator and TEŠ6, and also talked about army financing, precariousness and other current topics.
Who is Nika Kovač?
Last year, Nika Kovač, director of the March 8 Institute, was part of the Barack Obama Foundation's elite class of 40 future European leaders, where she learned from people in the US administration and connected with the most penetrating activists. to the President of the United States. When Obama turned 60 in August this year, he ranked her among the world's 60 creators of social change.
""This confirmation means that you are doing something that is visible. It means that I have made friends from all over Europe. Friends that I can ask about their projects. And above all, that I am learning to re-establish critical thinking - even to the actions of the American administration, ""Kovaceva explains.
The young activist became most recognizable mainly because of the campaign with the petition Samo ja znači ja, which was finally legalized by politics after public pressure. It was also important because of the wide mobilization of people in the referendum on water, where voters plebiscitarily rejected Andrej Vizjak's law.
In August, when asked if she intended to go into politics, she replied: ""No, absolutely not. Nika Kovač is going abroad, so I will not be on any list."""

Three-month-old Luca was introduced to her in the backyard, where the famous leader raised her children Kirby Bumpus and her husband, Virgil Miller, who married in December 2020 at Oprah's house in Santa Barbara.
""I know you came to meet me and I was waiting to meet you,"" Oprah told little Luca, kissing his arm. The meeting was missed by Gayle, who at that time had not yet complied with the strict rules under which the guests also met. ""Everyone who spends the holidays in my house must be vaccinated, tested and quarantined,"" the famous host wrote, adding: ""Stedman calls it 'politics' because I follow the rules so strictly.""

Irregularities relate, among other things, to the preparation of investment documentation, the purchase of equipment and the implementation of public procurement procedures.","According to the court, the ministry has already decided in advance what it will carry out within the national cloud computing project, and prepared the investment documentation only for formal requirements. According to the court, the documentation did not show the definition of the planned establishment of the national cloud computing. The purchase of equipment was adjusted to the approved funds, but not to the planned workload. The Ministry also mentioned in the documentation documents that did not exist and documents that were not relevant for the implementation of the project, they pointed out in the audit report.
In the final report on the project, the ministry claimed that the establishment of the cloud introduced an open standards policy, ensured service connectivity, established a unified service platform based on a common architecture to improve access to public services, ensures availability of services from anywhere and anytime, and information security is taken care of. However, they point out in court that no explanations were given for the allegations.
According to the court's findings, the Ministry selected an offer for the purchase of information security equipment that was technically unsuitable. ""Therefore, there was a double purchase of SIEM systems, which also meant double payment for the maintenance of licenses and external services for the same functionality until August 2018,"" the Court of Audit wrote.
In the investment documentation, the ministry explained that the project will significantly reduce the amount of financial resources for informatics in the state administration. But the Court of Audit found that the estimate of the ministry's savings varies in different documents, ranging from about 8.6 million to 20 million euros. At the same time, the ministry did not define what the estimate of savings should be, taking into account the costs of setting up the national cloud computing.
Also, the ministry did not prepare a report on the achieved effects of the project and an analysis of possible deviations, which must be prepared at least in the first five years after the commissioning of the project.
According to the Court of Audit, the Ministry is facing a lack of technical knowledge. In some areas, it does not even have suitably qualified staff to select contractors and supervise their implementation of contractually determined tasks, they estimated.
Among other things, the court points out the absence of an IT development strategy for the state administration. With its help, the ministry might have avoided the situation when it pursued the goals of centralization by reorganizing state informatics, and planned and purchased cloud technology in the investment documentation, they explained.
According to the court, the ministry also did not conduct an analysis of which of the possible installations of computer equipment would best support the envisaged goals of informatics in the state administration. ""The ministry prepared a national cloud project, which aimed to reduce costs for state informatics. The content of the project was mainly technologically defined. After the introduction of the national cloud, the way of working for end users did not change significantly. training, ""the court wrote.
The Court of Audit requested the Ministry to submit a response report and made several recommendations to improve performance."

Many of them were at midnight in churches, where, compared to last year, slightly milder epidemiological measures are in force. Politicians also express good wishes to citizens on holidays.","Archbishop Alojzij Cvikl donated the midnight mass in the Maribor Cathedral, emphasizing that Christmas is not just a glow of lights and decorations, but it is important to experience and feel God among people on this holiday.
According to Cvikl, God is with us and among us. Celebrating Christmas in all its reality therefore means feeling and experiencing God. Only such a Christmas can fill the heart with comfort, hope and peace, he said.
At midnight in the Koper Cathedral, the Bishop of Koper, Jurij Bizjak, reminded that all people are brothers to each other, so he called for mutual respect.
Pope Francis, meanwhile, called for humility during last night's evening Mass before Christmas. ""Let's stop crying for the greatness we don't have. Let's stop moaning and have long faces. Let's give up greed that never satisfies us,"" he said during a sermon at St. Peter's Basilica.
People have been chasing success for years and want to climb the pedestal, but God, on the other hand, showed above all humility, the pope added.
He recalled that Jesus was also surrounded in the manger by the small and the poor, the people from the periphery, not the important people. ""These were shepherds. They were the simplest and were closest to the Lord,"" Francis pointed out.
He advocated that dignity be restored to man and his hard work. Man is supposed to be the master of labor, not his slave. ""There are enough deaths due to work,"" added Frančišek, who called for a reduction in accidents at work.
Today, in his Christmas address at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican, he called for dialogue and recalled the many conflicts in the world, from Syria to Ukraine. At the end of his address, he gave a Christmas blessing to the city and the world (urbi et orbi).
""During the pandemic, our ability to maintain social contacts is being severely tested. We are increasingly closing ourselves in, including internationally,"" the pope said, noting that ""only dialogue leads to a real solution to conflicts.""
Francis recalled the ""great and forgotten tragedies"" in Syria and Yemen, which ""claim many victims and create countless refugees"".
He also called for dialogue ""so that the metastases of the conflict in Ukraine do not spread"", where military tensions are escalating along the border with Russia.

In his pre-holiday greetings, the Minister of the Interior, Aleš Hojs, emphasized that the December days are always an opportunity to look back on the past year and give a credible assessment of our actions and decisions. According to the ministry, last year was marked by an epidemic that dictated most of our actions in private and professional life. ""Unfortunately, next year will not be easy either, but as always we will enter the new year smiling, with eternal serenity of life and creative optimism,"" he announced, wishing all people a blessed and experienced Christmas holidays.

He wished everyone a Merry Christmas, all the best in 2022 and congratulated on Independence and Unity Day.
Some other ministers also congratulated the citizens on the holidays.

The President of the SAB, Alenka Bratušek, also wished pleasant holidays and plenty of health.
The president of the SD party, Tanja Fajon, emphasized in the video greeting that there had not been such a strong desire for change among the people in Slovenia for a long time.

He hung on to a political career, became a father, and is now set to get another job in Silicon Valley.","After Sebastian Kurz lost his position as Austrian Chancellor due to a political scandal, he is now expected to have a new job.

Austrian and German media report that the 35-year-old Kurz will work in the private sector, the contract has already been signed, it is supposed to be a ""management service in Silicon Valley"", which is home to many high-tech, IT and Internet companies.
Kurz resigned as federal chancellor in October after allegations of corruption. He and some of his closest political colleagues allegedly used taxpayer money to commission biased opinion polls. Kurz denies all allegations. Initially, he remained the leader of the conservative ÖVP and the leader of the parliamentary group, but in early December he suddenly announced his resignation from all functions.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/podgorsek-strateski-nacrt-skupne-kmetijske-politike-vliva-optimizem.html,Podgoršek: The strategic plan of the common agricultural policy is full of optimism,"The government has approved a 750-page-long strategic plan for the common agricultural policy 2023-2027 and Slovenia is sending it to the European Commission. At the presentation of the plan, the Minister of Agriculture, Jože Podgoršek, expressed his satisfaction with the process of preparing the plan, and he was also satisfied with the content of all the coordinations. The plan inspires optimism, he said.","Agriculture is a sector that is not capable of rapid change in the short term, and therefore it would not be right in the strategic plan to expect extremely rapid change in just five years. However, the right directions are being indicated, said Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Jože Podgoršek at the presentation of the plan.
He is also extremely satisfied with the prepared strategic plan because Slovenia has recognized the strategic nature of agriculture and has added more financial resources than the minimum required.
In the Strategic Plan for 2023-2027, the first pillar, which covers direct payments and deals exclusively with European funds, weighs 688 million euros, and the second pillar, the rural development program, weighs 550 million euros. In addition to the obligatory minimum share of 230 million euros, Slovenia will add an additional 310 million euros agreed with the representatives of organizations in the field of agriculture to this amount. A total of 540 million euros of national funds.
According to the Minister, the additional agreed funds will be used for investments for the necessary restructuring of agriculture and the food processing sector. In addition, the second pillar is for investment in adaptation to climate change and investment in animal welfare.
First pillar funds are primarily focused on basic income support for sustainability, where the biggest change is the abolition of t. i. historical payments, namely a single payment per hectare. The Minister rejected in this regard the allegations that everyone is losing out as a result of this change. As he said, they maintain the same amount of funds on farms, but there is a transfer of funds. In this context, he also announced that they would take an intensive approach to editing databases and expected a decline in the number of agricultural holdings applying for grants; there are currently about 57,000 of them.
Otherwise, the future agricultural policy is more environmentally ambitious than before. Part of the funds is thus directed through the Environment and Climate Scheme to encourage the adoption of more sustainable agricultural practices. Due to the high ambitions of environmental, climate and nature protection goals in the second pillar, where 41 percent of European funds are allocated, Slovenia decided to use the rebate and therefore allocates 15 instead of 25 percent of the envelope to the environment and climate scheme in the first pillar.
According to the analyzes, the strategic plan identifies cattle breeding, suckler cow breeding, milk production in the mountain area and sheep breeding as sectors in difficulty included in coupled income support. The strategic plan maintains payments for areas with natural and other constraints, the plan also envisages comprehensive support and a combination of different supports for young farmers, and will promote development networks and knowledge transfer projects.
According to the Minister, Slovenia is sending the plan to the European Commission today, with which it will start coordination next year. However, the Minister does not expect significant changes, as they have already had some informal coordinations, but of course Slovenia will have to prove and justify some of the planned measures. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Slovenia is one of the first EU countries to send a strategic plan to the European Commission.
At the same time, the strategic plan remains an important challenge for next year also because it will be necessary to work on the implementation work. Above all, according to the minister, the plan is a good guide, which inspires optimism that it will be easier and better in a few years.
The Minister also said that the approved strategic plan in the field of agriculture last year represents one of the best possible conclusions of the year. In the presentation, he pointed out the complexity of preparing the plan and the many coordination and negotiations, especially when it came to money.
The plan was basically prepared on the basis of more than 150 different workshops and meetings over the past three years, followed by a number of coordinations and negotiations during two public hearings this year, resulting in a strategic plan on the table. He also thanked his team at the ministry and all stakeholders who participated in the preparation of the plan."

It also establishes a legal basis for decisions on restricting entry into Slovenia from countries with a poor epidemiological picture. For the period up to 31 December 2022, they will be able to be ranked a maximum of 63rd salary grade (now 57th).
In the field of proposed assistance to individuals, the Minister pointed out assistance to pensioners with pensions of up to 714 euros, in the amount of 130, 230 or 300 euros, and farmers without pensions over 65, the disabled and war veterans who will be entitled to 150 euros of solidarity supplement. “It’s not about an energy voucher, these will be treated separately,” he added. In addition, the proposal provides for a monthly allowance of 30 or 25 euros per day.
The plan also partially reimburses lost income for the duration of quarantine at home or inability to perform work due to force majeure due to childcare obligations and additional funding for family support programs. Šircelj also reminded that it will be possible to use the unused annual leave for 2020 until 1 April 2022, and the one for 2021 until the end of next year.
Among the proposed measures to help the economy, he pointed out a new measure that will enable the Slovenian Enterprise Fund to provide liquidity loans to companies, and it is also planned to extend the duration of the financial incentive program to next year. According to the proposal, the validity of last year's tourist vouchers will also be extended until the end of June 2022 (voucher 21 has meanwhile been extended by the government for the same period by a decision).
Regarding the bill, the Legislative and Legal Service pointed out that they had initially issued comments on almost all articles of the bill, including in terms of compliance with the Constitution. The coalition has therefore proposed a number of proposed amendments, but it should be noted that ""all comments remain relevant"" of the legislative and legal service, said lawyer Sonja Bien Karlovšek. She particularly pointed out that such laws further reduce the transparency and clarity of the regulation and that legal addressees find it increasingly difficult to understand their legal position.
Polnar upset opposition lawmakers
Committee chairman Robert Polnar said that as much as 75 percent of the amendments to the PKP10 were not in accordance with the rules of procedure, but he decided to continue the meeting of the committee, in which the coalition has a majority. This blew up opposition MPs who left the session.
According to Andreja Zabret (LMŠ), the session is a precedent in the history of Slovenia, and the chairman of the committee has double standards. ""In the past, he described our amendments as inadmissible, but today he has given the coalition the opportunity to accept what it wants. Changing the pay system is destroying public health. We will not participate in the LMS,"" she said.
Matjaž Han (SD) reiterated that the coalition and its supporters are consciously denying the constitution and legislation. ""With the majority they have on this committee, we would outvote the opposition and pass a law that would be against the constitution and the laws. So we decided to leave this session. I am sad and disappointed.""
Luka Mesec (Left) emphasized that the foundation of every modern state is the constitution. ""30 years after its adoption, our constitution is being overthrown. What is happening on the Finance Committee is the lowest point of Slovenian statehood,"" he said, pointing out that governing the law is not the same as the rule of law. ""At the moment, we are in favor of the ruling policy disregarding the rule of law. The PKP has made this clear. The measures are illegal and unconstitutional.""
Alenka Bratušek (SAB) said that it was ""inadmissible that the ruling coalition is no longer valid for the ruling coalition"". She pointed out that not all things in PKP 10 are bad, but accepting packages in this way is inadmissible. Both Bratušek and Mesec described the anti-crown packages as ""the second ZUJF"". Bratušková added that it is inappropriate for the package to be accepted the day before the holiday and in such a way.
Left parties later said that the proposed amendment to the intervention law was a final blow to the already well-established public sector pay scale and a ""gift for the best paid doctors so passionately represented by the Fides medical union.""
The supplement, on the other hand, will not bring any benefits to young doctors, nor to nurses, carers and other underpaid and overburdened staff, the party is confident. “Enriching and increasing the privileges of those already best paid during a severe health crisis is immoral,” they point out. They reminded that the coalition prepared the amendment without social dialogue."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/fajonova_2.html,"Fajonova: Now is not the time for partial projects, now is the time to stand together","The president of the Social Democrats, Tanja Fajon, called for a strong consensus for change. She invited all democratic forces, civil society and emerging parties to the talks. Among other things, Robert Golob, with whom she is expected to meet after the holidays. “Now is not the time for partial projects, now is the time to stand together,” Fajonova stressed.","At the end of the year, the president of SD Fajonova united the narrower and wider leadership of the party and appeared before the media, saying that ""a difficult year is behind us"". ""A year of disappointment, anger and helplessness. It has clearly shown us that the government is ruled by chaos, conflict and corruption. The government concludes this year with a negative assessment. This assessment is given by 70 percent of citizens,"" she said.
She added that she believes that a crucial decision awaits us - whether we will be a democratic state or a dictatorship. ""We Social Democrats have a responsibility to bring about change together with all the democratic opposition, civil society and the people.""
According to her, the first change will be brought about by the victory over the current government to stop ""its harmful, illegal and unconstitutional conduct"". ""The second change will be a different kind of governance,"" the party said. According to Fajonova, Slovenia needs a capable, connected and efficient government to restore democracy, maintain and strengthen public health, lay sound foundations of public finances, implement a fair green transition and pledge economic development that will benefit everyone.
She also warned that a scattered parliament, divided into weak parties and lists, would not lead to a government that would be able to lead Slovenia safely and differently. That is why she called for a ""strong consensus for change"". ""Let's stand together. I want to talk to everyone - to movements, emerging parties and civil society, to all democratic forces. Everyone is welcome in the new alliance for change. Now is not the time for partial projects, now is the time to come together,"" he said. she said.
Among other things, she announced talks with Robert Golob, former CEO of Gen-I, who said he was returning to politics. As confirmed to us in the SD, they plan to meet after the holidays. The party said that SD was contributing to the agreement ""a strong program for a new beginning and the best program for the challenges facing Slovenia"". ""We have a competent and capable team of warm-hearted people. We have the will and energy to fight for the vision of Slovenia, in which we wholeheartedly believe,"" they wrote in a press release.
Asked if anyone else could join the KUL coalition, she said they were willing to communicate with anyone who disagreed with the current government's actions. According to her, the KUL parties will then decide who they will accept in the coalition. ""We invite everyone to meetings, and many of these meetings are already underway,"" she added.
The LMŠ, Levica and SAB, which in addition to the SD form the KUL, did not want to comment on the SD's call today. The same comments were not made today in the SDS and Nova Slovenija.
In today's statement for the media, Fajonova's invitation was commented on by the Speaker of the National Assembly Igor Zorčič, who is participating in the formation of the new party LIDE (Liberal Democrats). As he said, he welcomes every call that leads to conversation, unification, rapprochement, but he does not have any illusions, as Slovenian politics is very polarized. Therefore, he estimates that it would be best or most realistic to start with small steps. He highlighted the case of the liberal parties that are members of the ALDE European Group. If the latter showed a willingness to cooperate, it would be an important signal for him as well, as he is participating in the establishment of a third liberal party, he said.
Asked whether this call was an emergency call, Zorčič said that it was ""perhaps an emergency call, but in the end it is a force"". According to him, it is also necessary to be aware that there are certain differences between the KUL parties. According to Zorčič, he pointed out that SD and Levica could join forces, as well as LMŠ and SAB, which in his opinion should unite. Maybe even with a group with which he is designing a new party, as this would be ""the healthiest for our political environment"". He added that Fajon's call today could also be understood as a fight for former GEN-I CEO Robert Golob, who could shuffle political cards.
Zorčič stated that he was not afraid that the fragmentation of the parties in the so-called left or liberal center would have a significant impact on the final election result. As he recalled, there have been several attempts at unification in the past, including in the center-left and after the collapse of the Šarc government. ""There were some efforts there too, but it was all in vain. And sometimes some things have to be disassembled a bit in order to put them together,"" he said. According to Zorčič, on the one hand there is talk of broad integration, but on the other hand ""some of the current actors are not capable of even this small cooperation"".
However, the mayor of Kočevje, Vladimir Prebilič, responded to the invitation, and if there is an invitation, he is always ready for talks. Prebilič, we know that he is founding the Club of Mayors, in an invitation to 130 non-partisan mayors he writes that the goal is to establish an interest movement and even more clearly express expectations of political elites."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/dodik_2.html,An investigation against Dodik has been launched on suspicion of attacking the constitutional order,"The Bosnian Prosecutor's Office has launched an investigation against 13 people on reasonable suspicion of attacking the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their goal was to change the constitutional order of BiH, overthrow its highest institutions and reduce the defense power of BiH, reads the justification of the investigation. According to local media, the first suspect is Serbian member of the BiH presidency Milorad Dodik. Among other things, he is suspected of illegally forming an army.","Among the suspects are the President of the Republic of Srpska Željka Cvijanović, the Prime Minister of the Republic of Srpska Radomir Višković and the President of the Parliament of the Republic of Srpska Neđeljko Čubrilović. According to Dnevni Avaz, an investigation has been launched against people who took part in the ""unconstitutional and illegal drafting"" of legislation in the fields of defense, justice, security and indirect taxation this year.
Dodik is also accused of deliberately organizing a group of people whose targets were criminal acts, when they ""tried to change the constitutional order of BiH and overthrow the institutions of BiH"" with the help of ""threats of physical violence"". The Prosecutor's Office also draws attention to the controversial process of withdrawing this entity from a number of central BiH institutions.
So far, leaders of opposition parties in the entity's parliament have been questioned as witnesses. However, they do not intend to interrogate the suspects for now, writes the Serbian news agency Tanjug.
Dodik points a finger at a ""political mob"" from Sarajevo
In response to the investigation, Dodik today threatened to ban the operation of BiH's judicial bodies in Republika Srpska. According to him, the investigation was launched due to ""calls from the political mob from Sarajevo"", reports the Croatian news agency Hina.
Nevertheless, he is ready to respond to the prosecution's summons for questioning, he added.
He added that his policy did not have many supporters in Europe, but pointed out Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who he said was an important European statesman and visionary. The Republic of Serbia intends to develop friendly relations with Hungary, he added.
This month, the Republika Srpska parliament launched a controversial process of withdrawing the entity from a number of BiH's central institutions. Despite warnings from the West, he adopted a proposal obliging the local government to transfer powers in the military, taxes and the judiciary from the state level to the entity level in the next six months."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/orban-dodik.html,Orban on Dodik's side: Hungarian 100 million euros for Republika Srpska,"In a tense political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has strongly sided with Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik. He described him as a democratically elected politician and warned the West that ""Dodik's exorcism"", which wants to separate Republika Srpska from BiH, would be very dangerous. He asserted that Hungary would block any attempt at sanctions against him. Orban also confirmed that Hungary had allocated 100m euros to the Bosnian Serb entity. They are intended for small and medium-sized enterprises, and political analysts in the region fear that the money will actually be used to achieve Dodik's goals.","Bosnia and Herzegovina is experiencing the worst political crisis since the end of the war in the 1990s. The Serbian representative in the presidency, Milorad Dodik, is said to be most responsible for the aggravated situation in BiH, where separatist tendencies are emerging. The Republika Srpska parliament, in which his party has a majority, voted this month to withdraw its representatives from joint state institutions. In the coming months, they intend to transfer responsibilities in the field of taxes, the judiciary and the army to the level of the Serbian entity.
Europe and the United States are considering sanctions against Dodik, the new German government called for in mid-December. ""Attempts at partition are not acceptable,"" said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock.
€ 100 million for companies in Republika Srpska
Threats of sanctions were also commented on by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. “We need to prevent that,” he was clear. ""Wrong posture, wrong tone and problems are on the horizon,"" he said, adding that the Western Balkans needed to be integrated and helped. He stressed that the southern Hungarian border is close to the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina, and any conflict would affect Hungary as well.
At the same time, he clearly stated that the Balkans cannot be stabilized without BiH, and stabilization of BiH is not possible without Serbs: ""Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot be stabilized if Serbs are not given back the rights they must have,"" he said at a press conference. . According to the Balkan Insight portal, it lasted for three hours, but was one of the few where critical questions to the Hungarian leader were allowed.
Answering a question from the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (Birn), Orban confirmed that the Hungarian government has provided 100m euros in financial assistance to Republika Srpska under a responsible neighborhood policy that promotes stability in the region, he said. The money is supposed to go to small and medium-sized enterprises, and political analysts in the region fear that the money will actually be used to achieve Dodik's goals, Radio Free Europe reports.
Business interests at the forefront?
Orban's government has not paid much attention to Bosnia and Herzegovina for many years, but in 2019 Orban began to strengthen relations with Dodik. In November this year, he also visited Banja Luka and Dodik's hometown of Laktasi, which sparked speculation about the Hungarian agenda in BiH.
In addition to being close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and Serbian leader Alexander Vucic, analysts have questioned whether Orban is looking for even more allies in the region, or whether it is in fact Hungarian business interests in this part of Europe."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/nemcija-omejila-prihode-z-otoka-zaostrovanje-ukrepov-zaradi-omikrona.html,"Germany has restricted arrivals from the Island, where 12 omicron deaths have been confirmed","Due to the spread of the coronavirus version of omicron, more and more countries across Europe and the world are tightening their measures. The German government has decided to drastically limit arrivals from the UK as of today, and they are also planning new, stricter measures. In the UK, 12 deaths with omicron have been confirmed so far. Israel has banned travel to several European countries, and the U.S. warns against socializing and traveling during the upcoming holidays.","Due to the rapid expansion of the new version, new, stricter measures are already being planned in Germany to prevent the breakdown of healthcare and the entire critical infrastructure.
Authorities in Berlin have ranked the UK among the most risky areas where more dangerous versions of the virus are prevalent. However, passengers from these areas are subject to particularly strict restrictions on entry. Otherwise, for all - including those vaccinated against covid-19 and those who have survived - a two-week quarantine is mandatory, which can be terminated prematurely after a certain time with a negative test for a new coronavirus.
In the United Kingdom, which has a high level of vaccination coverage, the epidemiological situation has deteriorated dramatically in recent days due to the rapid spread of omicron. Omicron is now the predominant version of the new coronavirus on the Island, also in neighboring Ireland.
The new version is extremely contagious and quickly displaces the delta, also because it is able to largely circumvent existing immune protection gained by vaccination or infection with one of the other versions of the coronavirus. Due to its rapid spread, both German professions and politicians are also planning other containment measures.
These could be confirmed as early as Tuesday at a meeting of the presidents of the German Länder with the federal government. At stake are measures to secure critical infrastructure and significantly limit contacts. The priority is to avoid overloading the German healthcare system in the face of the expected new wave of pandemics due to omicron.
The position of the government's expert advisory council, published on Sunday, says that if the spread of omicron in the country continues, it will suddenly become ill or quarantine more people, which would put a heavy burden on the German health system and critical infrastructure. Vaccination with a booster dose alone will not be enough to sufficiently dam the Omicron-driven wave.
Earlier on Sunday, German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach ruled out the possibility of declaring the closure of public life before Christmas, such as in the Netherlands, due to the growing number of coronavirus infections in Germany. But at the same time, he pointed out that the omicron is definitely the fifth wave that will have to be tackled.
In the UK, 12 people died with omicron
In the UK, the number of coronavirus infections with omicron is steadily increasing. According to the latest data from the health authorities, the number of deaths after omicron infection has risen to 12. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Justice Dominic Raab, meanwhile, admitted that he could not rule out further aggravation of measures before Christmas.
Raab said the data is still being analyzed. He added that the country is certainly in a ""better position"" this year when it comes to the possibility of spending the Christmas holidays with loved ones, but he still cannot give any firm assurances that this will continue to be the case. He, meanwhile, advised people to be extremely careful in the coming days.
A further 12,133 cases of the new version were reported in the UK on Sunday, with a total of 37,101 cases confirmed so far. The number of deaths after coronavirus version of omicron has meanwhile risen to 12, and the number of hospitalizations of patients confirmed or suspected of being infected with the new version is 104.
The advice published by the Sage Scientific Advisory Group published over the weekend warns that the number of infections and hospitalizations of covid-19 patients in the country is likely to be much higher.
The British government, meanwhile, has launched a booster vaccination campaign amid a wave of highly contagious versions of omicron, with the aim of getting the third dose received by all adults by the end of December.
A record 830,403 people were vaccinated in England on Saturday, but in order to achieve the set goal, they would have to vaccinate about a million a day by the end of the year, reports dpa.
Israel is expanding the red list, the United States warns
Tel Aviv, meanwhile, announced a new decision by the Israeli government banning travel to and arrivals from the United States, Germany, Italy, Canada, Turkey, Switzerland, Belgium, Morocco, Hungary and Portugal.
In the USA, where a new large increase in infections has been detected, which the authorities also attribute to the omicron version, they are warning of the upcoming holidays. In some states, tightening measures have already been announced due to the rapid spread of the omicron version.
As of today, only those vaccinated against covid-19 and patients will be able to enter Austria without mandatory quarantine. For all those who have not been vaccinated or overcame covida-19, an immediate ten-day quarantine will be mandatory when crossing the border, which can be terminated prematurely after five days with a negative test. Registration on the web portal will also be mandatory.
ECDC: Omicron confirmed in 28 European countries, no fatalities so far
From last Thursday to Sunday, just over 1,500 new cases of the coronavirus version of omicron have been confirmed in European countries, with a total of 4,691 in 28 countries, the European Center for Disease Control and Prevention said today. No deaths have been reported among those infected with this version, which is already prevalent in the UK, for example.
Confirmed cases of omicron infection have so far been reported from 28 EU Member States and the European Economic Area. A maximum of 2,060 cases are reported from Norway, which said it had previously considered probable cases as confirmed cases. In Denmark, 726 cases have been confirmed by genomic sequencing, and a total of more than 14,700 PCR tests have been confirmed, according to the ECDC. The number of cases of omicron in Slovenia remains 10.
In most cases for which relevant information is available, the infection was either asymptomatic or mild, and no deaths have been reported. However, as the ECDC points out, these data should be assessed with caution, as the number of officially confirmed cases is too low to state with certainty that the clinical picture of the disease after omicron infection differs from previously detected variants."
https://www.24ur.com/sport/ostalo/peng.html,Peng Shuai vehemently denied being the subject of sexual harassment,"Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai said in an interview with the Chinese-language newspaper Lianhe Zaobao in Singapore that she had never been the subject of sexual harassment and that the stories around it were fabricated. ""I didn't say that and write even less. Please make this story end once and for all. It hurts me and my loved ones,"" the 35-year-old tennis player said.","Thirty-five-year-old Peng Shuai, a former world number one in doubles and a two-time grand slam tournament winner, accused the former high-ranking Chinese politician of sexual assault in early November. Since then, the association has repeatedly expressed deep concern over the fate of the tennis player, who has disappeared from public life.
But the turning point in the story came after an exhaustive interview given by a Chinese woman for a Singapore newspaper. ""It must be clear to everyone that I have never convicted anyone of sexually assaulting or harassing me. I would like to be very clear about this and there should be no doubt,"" Peng Shuai told the Chinese-language newspaper. . She added that her rights and freedoms had not been violated at any time, nor had she been prevented from moving normally. ""No one has restricted me and no one has controlled me. I am completely free all the time and I ask that these theories stop. I am here and I feel great,"" Peng Shuai told Lianhe Zaobao.
Recall, Peng wrote on November 2 in a lengthy post on Weibo that 75-year-old Zhang Gaoli forced her into sex after inviting her to his house three years ago to play tennis with him and his wife. Only half an hour later, her post was deleted. The Chinese, a former 14th-ranked tennis player in the world, has played nine times in singles finals in WTA tournaments, winning two titles in 2016 in Tianjin and 2017 in Jiangxi. In the doubles competition, she won 23 titles in WTA tournaments. In 2014, at the US Open in New York, she was the third Chinese woman in history, after Jie Zheng and Na Li, to reach the semifinals of the grand slam tournament in individual competition.
In response to her announcement, many athletes, politicians and human rights activists from around the world have expressed concern for her well-being. As information from official China about the 35-year-old's fate was not enough to end worries about her safety and well-being, the WTA canceled all tennis tournaments in China and Hong Kong in early December. Her case also overshadowed preparations for the February Beijing Winter Olympics. The chairman of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), German Thomas Bach, has been the target of criticism of the IOC response. He interviewed Peng Shuai via video call, but did not provide the necessary assurances that everything was fine with the actress. Bach has repeatedly emphasized that ""silent diplomacy"" in talks with China is the best way forward. Asked whether she will travel abroad or if she wants to travel abroad, Peng Shuai emphasized that she is no longer actively playing tennis. She added, as the dpa writes, that she does not currently intend to leave China due to the Crown Pandemic: ""What should I do abroad now?""
According to STA, the WTA responded to the video conversation and wrote in a press release that ""she still has great concerns about her well-being and ability to communicate without censorship or coercion.""
""We continue to urge a full, fair and transparent investigation into her allegations of uncensored sexual assault,"" the WTA said in a statement to the French news agency AFP."

The new head of state is 35-year-old left-wing Gabriel Boric, a Chilean congressman with Croatian roots. He defeated the far-right candidate José Antonio Cast in the election. His progressive policy, based on social inclusion, the expansion of social rights and the protection of the environment, convinced most voters, and Boric's victory also marks the rise of the country's progressive left.","Only 35-year-old left-wing congressman Gabriel Borić defeated his right-wing opponent, 55-year-old populist José Antonio Cast, in the second round of Chile's presidential election by a bigger margin than polls had predicted.
The caste conceded defeat after receiving 44 percent of the vote after 99 percent of the votes were counted, and Borić 56 percent. ""I just talked to Borić and congratulated him on his great success,"" Kast wrote on the social network. ""He is the president-elect of Chile. He deserves our respect and constructive cooperation. Chile always comes first,"" he added.
Boric, a descendant of Croatian immigrants, will take over in March next year.
After the election success, Borić's supporters celebrated the victory with loud cheers and hugs in the streets of Santiago, waving flags and banners with the politician's face in the air, as well as rainbow flags marking the LGBTIQ + community. Voters were particularly convinced by Borić's inclusive social policy and plans to revise the country's market-oriented economic model, foreign media reported.
In his speech after the victory, the politician also announced that his government would expand the social rights of the population, but that it would do so fiscally responsibly and in the light of concern for the health of the economy of this largest copper producer in the world. At the same time, he will oppose mining projects that are destroying the environment. ""By destroying the world, we are destroying ourselves. We do not want more projects that are destroying our country and our communities,"" the newly elected president said. Thus, it also opposes the controversial Domingo project, which involves the mining of iron, copper and gold.
President of all Chileans, not just those who voted for him
Speaking to President Sebastián Piñera, who will step down in March, Borić said he would be president of all Chileans, ""not just those who voted for me"". ""We are united. We are hope. We are more when we are together. Let's move on!"" the incoming president told supporters.
The first round of the presidential election took place on 21 November. The caste received about 28 percent of the vote at the time, while Boric received 26 percent. Turnout was around 47%. This time, in the second round, it was 56 percent, the highest since 2012, when participation is no longer mandatory.
Borić was one of the leaders of mass anti-government protests in 2019. He won as the candidate of the left-wing electoral alliance Apruebo Dignidad (I support dignity), which wants to raise taxes and increase social spending. This alliance also includes the Communist Party. During the campaign, Boric assured that he would put an end to the neoliberal economic model left behind by dictator Augusto Pinochet.
A lawyer with German roots, José Antonio Kast, meanwhile, comes from the Republican Party. His father was a Nazi and his brother Miguel one of Pinochet’s leading advisers. The caste is considered a sympathizer of Brazilian far-right President Jair Bolsonar and the military dictatorship in Chile.
During the campaign, the loser announced tax cuts, immigration restrictions and a fierce fight against crime. He blamed migrants from Venezuela and Haiti for the rise in crime. It also opposes same-sex marriage and abortion."

They came with seven vessels, reports the newspaper La Repubblica. Rescuers spotted the child among about 70 men in a boat that landed yesterday.
""He crossed the Mediterranean even before he learned to walk. He himself fought bravely on the waves ... too young to reveal his name and his story,"" the author wrote.
Other migrants claimed that they did not know who the child was, but that their parents had asked them to protect him during the dangerous journey, probably because they had been prevented from boarding with the child.
Among the people who arrived these days is a 14-year-old who was traveling with his mother, who died while rescuing in front of the island.
""She traveled in a boat with 25 other people, including her son, who then saw her drown,"" Doctors Without Borders wrote on Twitter.
""Another loss that could have been prevented on the threshold of Europe, another life demanded by irresponsible migration policy,"" they added.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/svetovni-dan-migrantov.html,"On World Migrants Day: fatal shipwrecks, sexual violence and slavery","On the occasion of the International Migrants' Day, which we are celebrating today, Slovenian Caritas called on policy-makers to facilitate people's mobility, as they are only looking for security and better living conditions. As they wrote, people along the way are human beings, each with their own story. They leave their home and cross borders for a variety of reasons. Among other things, seeking protection from wars, conflicts and persecution, hunger and other consequences of climate change, finding work to survive and live a more dignified life, studying or reuniting with family members.","""Like everyone else, migrants need to be treated in a way that preserves human dignity. They need to be provided with safe, orderly and regular routes to Europe in such a way that walls will not have to be built and people on the road will not be victims of violence. but they need to be provided with basic human goods on this path, ""they are convinced of Slovenian Caritas, where they are also launching a fundraising campaign to promote solidarity to help migrants in Poland along the border with Belarus.
Migrants and those who defend their rights are facing particularly difficult times in a Europe where politics of fear and rejection have prevailed recently. ""Fatal shipwrecks for migrants who lost their lives in the English Channel and the Mediterranean (tracking 1,369 migrants in 2021), people left to die in the cold forests on the EU's doorstep on the border with Belarus, countless expulsions and returns of migrants to Greece and on the Balkan migrant route, there are only a few cases, ""they state on Slovenian Caritas.
Manou Ballyn of Caritas Belgium is coordinating a project to provide support for unaccompanied minors from Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia on their way from Belgium to the United Kingdom. He explains the difficult path experienced by many unaccompanied minors: ""Many have passed through Libya, where they have been exposed to sexual violence, slavery and horrific and very traumatic treatment. In Europe, this is far from over, many report police violence and theft things.""
Many Syrian refugees who have fled to Lebanon are also victims of sexual violence. Caritas Lebanon is helping them with comprehensive care in two shelters through a project run in partnership with Slovenian Caritas and co-financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Slovenia. Project coordinator Hessen Sayah told one of the stories of refugees who were victims of violence: ""M. is a 16-year-old girl who came to Lebanon with her mother. Her father died in Syria. After her father's death, her mother started working. with prostitution.M. was obliged to work with her even though she did not want to.When she came to the Caritas Lebanon shelter, she had trouble sleeping and suicidal thoughts, which necessitated psychiatric treatment as she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. She's doing better now, because she's already laughing. ""
Slovenian Caritas also strongly supports the message of Pope Francis, who during his visit to Lesbos in Greece on December 5 this year drew attention to the current situation, unworthy of man: ""It is worrying to hear proposals to use common funds to build walls and barbed wire [...] However, problems are not solved and coexistence is not improved by building higher walls, but by working together to care for others according to the concrete possibilities of each and with respect for the law, always giving priority to the inalienable value of life. of every human being. ""
""When we celebrate International Migrants Day, it is essential to overcome fear and instead accept migration and people on the road as a natural phenomenon that needs to be facilitated in an organized way. People have always crossed borders, whether for peace, love or better opportunities and conditions. We call for a fundamental change in migration policies: instead of financing the construction of walls to stop the movement of people, we are investing in safe and regular routes, decent reception centers and more friendly societies that enable social inclusion for the common good, ""said Maria Nyman, Secretary General of Caritas Europa.
The words of a nine-year-old student Nejc, who attends the fourth grade of primary school, are also mentioned in Slovenian caritas. As part of the Caritas Literary Competition on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, held in November 2021 as part of the project For an Open, Just and Sustainable Europe in the World - EU Presidency Project 2020-2022, he wrote, among other things: ""Poor people strive when they are trying to find a better life than refugees, and we reject them.They are people, aren't they? And they are just as worthy as we are, right? But some think that if they are rich, they have the right to reject other people who have the same rights as us. We put up wire fences to make their lives as difficult as possible, they are just as worthy as we are, only poorer, but full of hope, Europeans could be more understanding of their situation, ours are much better because we have access to food, water, heat ... ""
Finally, they emphasized the positive contribution of migration to our societies, as migrants with their work and skills make an important contribution to the development and normal functioning of our societies, which was especially evident in the EU during the Covid-19 era. At the same time, they paid tribute to countless people who help migrants in one way or another and choose encounter and compassion instead of fear. Solidarity and inclusive accepting societies must be encouraged, not hatred and division. ""
How can you help?

On the occasion of the World Migrants' Day, Slovenian Caritas was also invited to concrete solidarity with migrants who came to Poland via Belarus and are without basic goods. The funds raised will be donated to Caritas Poland and will help migrants with basic necessities of life, provide educational and creative aids to migrant children, equip playgrounds and educational rooms for children in seven centers for migrant families in Poland, where it will also conduct integration workshops and psychological assistance for adults and children.

You can help migrants in Poland (along the Belarusian border) by sending an SMS KARITAS5 na 1919 with a gift value of 5 EUR or by sending a transfer to: Slovenska karitas, Kristanova ulica 1, 1000 Ljubljana, bank account: SI56 02140-0015556761, Reference: SI 00 840 , Purpose: To help refugees."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/dobrodelnost_2.html,"While politics divides us, charity strongly unites us","We are truly an extraordinary nation when it comes to helping others in need, which we have proven many times, especially in these difficult times. The initiators and organizers of the very resounding campaigns Denis Avdič and Ana Lukner Roljič also spoke about this in the 24UR ZVEČER show.","Light, warmth, joy, anticipation of a new and better year - but the scenery of this splendor are also windows that are not bright. There, the tables are not swayed by goodies, but by accumulated debts, reminders and executions.
A single mother - 300 euros rent, 255 euros for heating - earns 800 euros, what should she do? Distress professionals sometimes only find out from a child who tells them that he can’t learn because they don’t have heating at home and he gets too cold. ""Cold and damp apartments, closets without clothes and food. We really can't imagine how people can live in such environments,"" said Anita Ogulin from the Chain of Good People.
The father is sick, depressed, the debt collectors are breathing down his neck ... he and his son will be left without a stove, as this one is up for auction. A story that the Radio 1 team is also facing in a charity marathon. ""Slovenia worked a miracle last year. We raised a million euros. That's a huge amount. And with that we were able to help at least 2,000 families. Of course, we want this money to be even more,"" said Jana Morelj.
The radio operator Miha Deželak also raised funds for cycling tours around Slovenia, and in the spring we accompanied Vid Čeplak and charity auctions of sports equipment. ""Goran Dragić impressed me at his camp for that.""
December is a time when the belief that we need to rejoice, socialize and be happy is strengthened. ""All these expectations increase the pressure on people, thus intensifying anxiety, depression and feelings of loneliness in people who are not already in good skin,"" says psychologist Špela Hvalec. Elderly people and widows are often left behind the walls of anonymity, as they are often unable to overcome the stigma of asking for help. The VIDA Project is intended for them. Nina Kozorog, a doctor and project manager, says 725 seniors will be able to be cared for for 12 months in 2022.
The Ana Star project, which has been living for 11 years, is richer this year for the traceability of donations. ""Altruism is basically a mature defense mechanism. Charity or, more broadly speaking, help always brings pleasure to those who receive it and to those who offer it,"" Hvalčeva emphasizes.
Most of the people who turn to ZPM and the Chain of Good People for help are employed, but due to minimal incomes and the absence of social transfers, they cannot survive from month to month. December has caused so much hardship, so far we have been really used to everything, but never before. they include in the Chain of Good People because they want to give this society something good, ”says Ogulin.
As part of the Chain of Good People under the media auspices of our house, Slovenia also helped little Kris with a big heart, who can talk and walk in kindergarten today. The first boy in Slovenia has now received the same medicine as Kris in America. And so, when he grows up, he will be able to change the world for the better himself."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/golob_3.html,'The silent majority that avoids politics today really has the most power',"Hot events before the elections: the beginning of what is the public tribune of the Be a Change Robert Golob Society? Is it just a touch or is it already a concrete announcement for the elections? New customer or connection to an existing one? Who supports him? ""The silent majority that avoids politics today has the greatest power, it is the most politically oppressed. Our aim is to make them aware that they are taking this power into their own hands and deciding whether they want to live in a country that is not free, or a country that is normal, ”Golob says.","It is four months until the elections, so it is already very hot on the domestic political stage. We are witnessing the transfer of deputies to other parties, there is a battle for every deputy and, above all, a battle for every vote of voters, among whom, according to research, the strongest side is still undecided. But how to convince them? What to offer to be different than established politics - both the coalition and the opposition. And also, who has the courage to oppose the current offer and then the courage to pull it off? There are ideas, but what will the reality be?
Be a change is the name of the association that, under the tutelage of Robert Golob, prepared a public forum on Thursday ""What kind of country do we want to live in"". Golob was already in politics, then he was the director of GEN-I for many years, but the current government did not like him. Now it offers, as he says, a new vision, a new change.
As Golob explained in the show 24UR ZVEČER, the tribune was a call to all well-meaning people to get active, to actively enter politics and participate in elections. ""Only together will we be able to change the political culture. Because the political culture that rules Slovenia today, which promotes exclusively anger, fear and hatred, brings absolutely no value to the country and we must expel it. This political culture, according to our historical experience in Primorska, ""There is no right-wing policy, but we call it by another term, that is fascism. I think that there is no room for that in Slovenia and there should not be,"" he said.
According to him, there are experts in Slovenia who master their fields. And only when you unite them into one critical mass of like-minded people can we move collective Slovenia into a better future. ""At the time of independence, our material status was not important, we were ready to eat grass because we believed in a better future. Today we have full savings accounts, but we have no hope for a better future. And this is a dead end from which we must get out even if it takes new measures, new people ... That's enough! ""
Even before the President of the Court of Audit Tomaž Vesel addressed the public tribune, Prime Minister Janez Janša wrote that his EU colleagues told him that if he did so in Austria or Germany, the President of the Court of Audit should resign on the same day.
""Given that this forum was organized by civil society, the founding society, and that the topic was intriguing, in terms of what kind of country we want to live in, what's wrong with this country, it makes sense that the Auditor General , who runs an institution that has done more than 2,000 audits that are important to the country, can speak, ""Vesel replied. He added that no one will silence the Court of Auditors. ""It is true that we do not want political intervention, but to say what is good in the country or not, and we have that right. If what you say is true, I do not follow social networks, I think it is inappropriate interference with freedom of speech, who is somewhat unworthy. ""
He was happy to point out that the attacks of t. i. evil factories consistent for more than a year. ""I am not the problem, I will resign from the leadership of the Court of Auditors sooner or later. The problem is that we are attacking, dismantling institutions, it will be difficult for successors to dismantle the concept of the rule of law… We are the immune system of this country. worth destroying just to score some political point that is ultimately irrelevant? I don't know. ""
'Governing politics promotes darkness in all of us'
Pigeon constantly emphasizes values ​​such as truth and honesty. ""I emphasize the value that those who work hard and honestly should have it. But today in Slovenia hard and honest work is no longer a value, at least not for the ruling politics. It only encourages negative emotions. The theme in all of us. looking forward to success stories, trust and freedom, is only concerned with erasing everything we have fought for together for 30 years and creating an atmosphere of fear, with a single purpose - when people are scared and dare not speak, then you can rule at will. ""
When asked what change Golob and Vesel will be, Golob replied that no individual can change the system alone. Be change means that we urge every and every citizen to become politically active, because only the silent majority that avoids politics today really has the greatest power, it is the most politically oppressed. Our intention is to make them aware that they take the power they have into their own hands and decide whether they want to live in a country that is not free or in a country that is normal. ""
Will he become politically active himself? We are now appealing to civil society and movements to create a critical mass, Golob explained. ""There were six of us today who thought like that, in a week, two, three of us will be significantly more, in the end I believe there will be a lot of us, because only in a multitude of individuals is there real power that can bring change. we will have to adapt to the political system and move our movement within the party system as well, but there is still time for that. ""
What about Vesel, will he retire from the Court of Auditors into politics? ""No. My term of office is expiring, I have had a long period of running the Court of Auditors, I never expected such turbulent times as we have in the last period, but I still think we are doing well, we are fighting the pressures we have, very unreasonable, so I decided to take part in this round table and another one, if necessary. with reality. The public finance picture of Slovenia at the moment and for some time now is not good. We have a crisis of decision-making, key decisions are not made, due to the impotence of the whole spectrum of politics that does not talk to each other, there is no solution. "" The price of this is high public debt, very inappropriate communication and substantive discussions that have disappeared from public space. Sam is convinced that young people should be involved in politics, the country should be handed over to them.
Asked whether he would be ready to be the new Prime Minister of Slovenia, Golob said that only when they see who has become active will they decide who will lead the matter. It is too early to say that one face, one name will follow the path ... ""No one can be the best in the world alone, you have to have the best team and here too we want to build the best team through civil society.""
Regarding the support of other political parties, he said he thinks the KUL will eventually be their ally. ""It is true, however, that we as civil society must first organize ourselves, position ourselves appropriately - not left or right, but as those who connect everything. And then we can talk about political allies and the party system. There is enough time."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/v-kaksni-drzavi-zelimo-ziveti.html,Public tribune: what kind of country do we want to live in?,"The picture of the situation in Slovenia is sad - the devastation of state institutions, plundering everything possible, no morals, no laws, no Constitution… Until recently, Slovenia was an example to other countries, today it is no longer an example to anyone. But there is still time and hope to return things to normal, the interlocutors of Golob's public tribune were convinced. The opportunity for this will be in the elections on April 24 next year - everyone called for participation. From a silent majority, we need to become a loud and recognizable majority.","The political activation of former Gen-I CEO Robert Golob is gaining ground. As part of the new Be a Change movement, he organized a public tribune today in Kino Šiška in Ljubljana on the future of the country and, above all, on how to normalize life in our country.
Also present were Dragan Petrovec from the Institute of Criminology at the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana, President of the Court of Audit Tomaž Vesel, former head of the cardiology department at the Pediatric Clinic Mirta Koželj, Barbara Čenčur Curk from the Faculty of Natural Sciences in Ljubljana and co-founder of the Ivanž Center for Protection. .
'This is not a mature right-wing policy, but fascism'
The discussion was led by Primož Cirman. The introductory question to all interlocutors was: Where are we? What is the state of Slovenia? What is her heart rate? Koželj said in the style of her profession that we have an ""arrhythmia"". ""Let's imagine that an ECG would be measured in Slovenia, I think we would find some heart disorders and intermediate episodes of slow, ineffective heart rhythm,"" she explained. She emphasized that it was time to ""start talking openly about all the dilemmas and challenges of today"" in Slovenia.
Petrovec recalled the words of the Danish politician, which he has firmly entrenched in his memory. Asked what kind of country he would like, he replied that countries where there would be few very rich and even less very poor people. ""The picture of the situation we have is sad - the devastation of state institutions, the plundering of everything that is possible, no morals, no laws, no constitution, and some supposedly converted members of parliament are being sold to all ends and it is a temptation to each new emerging party had to defend itself "".
Golob said that Slovenia is a beautiful country with wonderful people. ""Until recently, we were an example to other countries, unfortunately we managed to destroy this reputation. Today, what is happening is no longer an example to anyone. But there is still time and hope to return things to normal,"" he said. ""The fight will be difficult, but we will succeed,"" he said. According to him, what we are witnessing from the right-wing government is not a mature right-wing policy of a Western European country, but fascism. ""It's time to say enough and push them away,"" he said, and there was a standing ovation in the hall.
He is happy to believe that Slovenia is facing a decision-making crisis and that politics is also incapable of serious decision-making. “Politics has become impotent in terms of decision-making, and at the same time we are witnessing the politicization of social systems or subsystems that politicization should not meet at all,” he stressed. He reminded that the attacks that are happening are brutal, ruthless, constant and have been going on for more than a year. According to him, there is a need to discuss in a structured way what to do for the future and future generations. “Another reason I’m here is that the institution I run can’t be quiet when we’re not doing well,” he added.
Gale said that an individual who chooses to speak must make an important decision because we live in a country where whistleblowers are afraid instead of afraid of those they speak about. ""Slovenia is changing from a land of the diligent to a land of the naughty, corruption is everywhere, the rulers think that the Constitution is a manual, not a binding act, and I as a lawyer and citizen cannot swallow it. they do not agree with the authorities. "" Gale, who is also noticing the erosion of the legal system in Slovenia, hopes that such a situation will not last long. A fresh start is needed, he urged. ""Otherwise, we can all leave the country and let the last one turn off the light.""
Čenčur Curkova said that as a geologist she noticed that erosion had been going on for a long time, it was getting faster and faster and would soon take away the hill. Remediation, plans and concrete actions are needed. ""We want a country that takes the profession into account in all areas of society.""
'First they impoverish you, then they give you alms'
Regarding the rise in energy prices, Golob said that the whole world is in an inflationary spiral due to the health crisis and increased demand. ""Even though this is a global phenomenon, politics has not solved the inaction."" Namely, Slovenian politics denies that we have already entered the energy crisis and predicts that they will take action when and if necessary. ""We all know it's an energy crisis that will spill over into final prices for the consumer.""
He pointed out that the spills have barely started and people will feel it most in January and February. ""Politics says that there is no crisis. They do not want to take preventive measures in a planned way. I would like to emphasize once again - the worst of the rise is yet to come, and people's plight is already present."" Regarding vouchers to help people: ""First they impoverish you, then they give you alms to depend on them and not demand political or any other freedom. It is a total planned policy of the government. It is not a coincidence, such coincidences. do not exist!"" he was clear.
Healthcare and supplements
Koželj believed that long waiting times were a problem with deep roots that had existed long before covid-19. This only made the picture worse. Staff shortages are also a problem. The salaries of doctors, which have been published in public, do not seem controversial to her, saying that it is right that good work is rewarded. Regarding the healthcare crisis, both Vesel and Koželj said that there was not enough money, it was just necessary to allocate it efficiently. They are also convinced that we have enough reserves.
Regarding the allowances during the corona crisis, Vesel said that he personally estimates that we were too generous. ""Instead of investing in the way out of the crisis, we tried to gain political points. We are approaching a debt of 40 billion euros and I find it difficult to listen to discussions that Slovenia's debt is not problematic. Debt is problematic."" In his opinion, it is necessary to intervene in the structure and costs of the state administration.
(Too) expensive housing
Regarding housing issues, Čenčur Curkova said that housing prices in Ljubljana are extremely high and young people cannot afford them, but only above-standard housing is being built. Gale reminded that prices are above standard, not housing. ""Most young people absolutely can't afford that, not to mention how poorly developed the rental market is."" Many young people are therefore forced to stay in the 'Hotel Mama' or expand a property, even though they all want to become independent as soon as possible. He is surprised that the programs of all political parties point to this problem, but nothing happens. Austria and the Scandinavian countries have this well-regulated, and looking there would be enough, he said.
He was happy to believe that Slovenia could not become a country where everyone lived in Ljubljana. ""It is true that Ljubljana is the most beautiful city in the world, but we also have the most beautiful countryside in the world and we must make sure that life there will be almost as favorable as in the metropolis."" In his opinion, all major Slovenian towns should have the same infrastructural conditions with internet access, communal conditions and transport routes to the centers.
'Epidemic took off people's masks'
Petrovec is convinced that the epidemic has revealed the government's first intention, which is to get rich. ""If that weren't true, then the government wouldn't have prevented academics, members of SAZU, who had good ties to China and were the first to offer protective equipment to get the deal done."" As is well known, it was given to intermediaries, but not to academics.
The other thing, according to Petrovac, was a great opportunity to control people - legally and illegally. ""We learned 40 years ago at the Faculty of Law that governing by decrees means abusing power."" According to him, the epidemic became more and more potent, and the last mask fell off.
'The consequences of the water referendum will be on April 24.'
Golob said that the consequences of the referendum on water have not been yet, but they will definitely come. ""April 24 will be the political consequences of the referendum. And rightly so. The government has turned against the people, we will solve this. But nature has also turned against the people and we must not close our eyes here, we must act immediately,"" he urged. Solar energy is a resource that Slovenia does not yet know how to use properly to reduce the effects of the climate crisis. This solves the problem of energy poverty. According to him, this is the right way to approach environmental challenges - to turn them to your advantage.
Whats next? Is it enough to change the political culture of Slovenia?
""The attitude towards culture is what determines the individual. In the business world, Maksima applies: companies with strong culture are winners in the market. The same applies to all social systems. Where a strong, clear culture with which individuals are able to identify, ""These subsystems are successful. This also applies to politics,"" Golob said. The politics of hatred, exclusion and fear cannot give any added value to the nation it rules. But if we succeed in bringing a culture of cooperation, freedom and trust into politics, then we can move mountains. 30 years ago we succeeded, we know. repeated on April 24, ""he announced.
Can the politics of fear win the election on April 24? “The society that organizes this forum is called Be a Change. It doesn’t just mean me, but all of us. It is the only strength in the collective and the community. When there are enough of us and we are activated with a single goal to move a culture from fear, hatred and anger to a culture of cooperation, freedom and trust, it will happen on its own. Waiting for the Savior will not help us because He is not there. We can all be the savior of the country! ”
Is Slovenia still a normal country? Golob replied that he hoped this was a rhetorical question. ""The European Parliament treats our country as an example of a bad EU member! If this is not a national disgrace, what is?"" The time we live in is important and fateful for Slovenia, because the cards are being dealt anew, Vesel said. If such a policy as we have now remains for four more years, it will be ""in ruins"", according to Petrovec. ""It has been written many times that this is not spreading because of the bearers of evil, but because of the silent majority.""
Independent institutions
He is afraid that the government, including the new one, would get ""unhealthy appetites"" from independent institutions. ""We, the independent institutions, were in a position to sit down with their leaders, talk and send a public message to preserve and respect our independence. The response was as bitter as before, but it attracted a great deal of interest from the international community. . ""
Nothing works in a country without independent institutions, Petrovec reminded. We all need to have an ombudsman over us, which has been shown in the attempt to stop European prosecutors. ""I myself give full support and my optimism to one set of NGOs that should be strong enough, have enough of our support and play the role of a watchdog.""
Concluding remarks: call for elections
In his closing remarks, Gale emphasized that next year's parliamentary elections will be a turning point. It is important that people take part in the elections. I hope that Slovenia will not be a hotbed until then, that it will be possible to change the mentality, to establish people's trust in independent institutions, the media, the judiciary. I firmly believe that better times lie ahead. "" From the point of view of the co-founder of the Whistleblower Protection Center, he also urged people not to be silent. ""Whoever speaks threatens a narrow interest group, and whoever is silent threatens everyone else.""
My wish is to become a 90% loud and recognizable majority from a silent majority, Petrovec added.
""We started talking openly and loudly about the challenges and problems. I'm glad we mentioned not only the problems, but also the possible solutions. We turned on the light at the end of the tunnel and I hope to see it in all its glory on April 24 next year, ""announced Kozelj.
I would be happy to see Slovenia taken as a project by young people. ""To take it as their own and snatch it from us, the elders. Let the young go to the polls, and let them vote what they want.""
Golob pointed out that we are different people, but that is what can make us stronger when we connect around a common goal. ""The more of us, the greater the strength of the collective. I want us to talk for the next five months about where we think alike, find common ground and move forward at full steam.""
According to Čenčur Curkova, the goal is clear - a better Slovenia. ""I hope young people are not just woken up by the water referendum and that they are still active. It is important that they see that this is their future."""

Kennedy, as U.S. ambassador to Australia. The 63-year-old Kennedy, a member of one of America's most famous political families, has been in the shortlist of candidates for high diplomatic positions ever since she supported Bidn's presidential candidacy.","Kennedy, meanwhile, described Australia as a country crucial to future American security and prosperity. She added that she looked forward to working with the Australian government to strengthen the alliance between the two countries, improve global health and increase access to vaccines, and address the climate crisis. She added that she is excited to get to know Australians, their fascinating country and share with them what she loves most about America.
Kennedy previously served as the US ambassador to Japan during the Barack Obama administration, which the White House highlighted in this nomination.

Many media outlets report that none other than Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has warmed to the services of the football official, who does not hide his ambitions to base the sporting structure of the 13-time European club champion on the arrival of young and talented footballers.","Just over a month ago, Michael Edwards, who according to the charismatic German Reds strategist Jürgen Klopp is one of the most responsible for Liverpool's acting and consequent renaissance in recent years, told the island's media that it may be time to change the work environment. .
""You will probably agree with me that ten years is a long time to survive in any job. But when we look at football, this period, given the many pressures that such work brings, is actually something unique and at the same time real. a rarity, ""said the sporting director of the European club champions from two years ago, making it clear between the lines that he is tempted to leave the cult Anfield Road after this season. This is increasingly being hinted at by many European media, including the prestigious The Independent, which went a step further and revealed that Edwards was the main 'target' of Real Madrid president Florentino Perez.
Even before Real's interest, they competed for Edwards' services at the financially reborn Newcastle, but according to The Independent, the Edwards politely declined the offer. He hasn't wasted much time listening to arguments as to why he (Michael Edwards, op. Cit.) Is wanted as Newcastle's sporting director. Michael wants a different challenge that he may or may not find in the Spanish capital.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/eu-letos-le-sprejela-siritvene-sklepe-a-brez-napredka-za-skopje-in-tirano.html,"The EU has only adopted enlargement decisions this year, but no progress has been made for Skopje and Tirana","EU ministers for European affairs adopted enlargement decisions in Brussels, which the union failed to do last year. However, they are not making any progress on the most pressing enlargement issue, the start of accession negotiations with Northern Macedonia and Albania. They even represent a step back from their previously expressed ambitions.","Slovenian State Secretary for European Affairs Gašper Dovžan, who chaired today's session, said with great satisfaction that they had unanimously adopted decisions on enlargement, coordinated by the Slovenian Presidency.
Enlargement decisions are traditionally taken by members at the end of the year on the basis of the European Commission's annual enlargement package. Today's compromise was by no means guaranteed. Last year, for example, members failed to take enlargement decisions. ""This is a masterpiece of Europe's ability to compromise in a spirit of loyal cooperation,"" said Vera Jourova, vice-president of the European Commission in charge of values ​​and transparency, thanking the Slovenian presidency.
The adoption of the conclusions is politically important, because otherwise, if last year's failure were repeated, European unity and the attitude towards the enlargement process could be called into question. The unanimous adoption was successful after the great efforts of the Slovenian Presidency. But the fact is that the conclusions on what is currently the most pressing enlargement issue - the start of accession negotiations with Northern Macedonia and Albania - are not making any progress. They even represent a step backwards compared to the previously expressed ambitions of both the European Commission and the Slovenian Presidency.
The 'by the end of the year' timeframe has been replaced by a looser term 'as soon as possible'
Both last year and in October this year, the European Commission called for the start of accession negotiations with both countries 'this year'. Slovenia also explicitly sought a breakthrough by the end of the year, ie by the end of Slovenia's presidency of the Council of the EU. In the conclusions approved by the ministers today, the concrete timeframe ‘until the end of the year’ has been replaced by a looser term ‘as soon as possible’. ""The Council looks forward to convening the first intergovernmental conference with the Republic of Northern Macedonia and Albania as soon as possible after the approval of the negotiating framework,"" the conclusions said.
The European Commission has repeatedly assessed that the two countries meet the conditions for the start of accession negotiations. The green light was also given by members in March last year. But then things got complicated because the process is blocked by Bulgaria over bilateral issues with northern Macedonia. The situation was further aggravated by the political crisis in the country.
Asked whether the Slovenian presidency was frustrated by the diluted ambition in connection with the negotiations with the two countries, Dovžan said that the adopted decisions were considered a great success, that some steps were not feasible this year. is very optimistic after the confirmation of the new Bulgarian government that it will be possible to follow the set path as soon as possible.
In their conclusions, the members reaffirmed their commitment to enlargement, which remains a key EU policy and unwavering support for the European perspective of the Western Balkans. These are also the key and important messages of the EU-Western Balkans Summit, which took place in Brdo in October and was the main event of the Slovenian Presidency.
Last July, the European Commission drafted a framework for accession negotiations with Northern Macedonia and Albania, setting out the guidelines and principles of the process. It is now up to the EU members to approve the framework. This has not been possible so far due to the Bulgarian veto. Following the confirmation of the negotiating framework, the Presidency may convene the first negotiating conference, which marks the symbolic start of negotiations."

The Russian Foreign Ministry said it could also respond to this hostile measure. President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, also called for immediate talks with the United States and NATO on guarantees for Russia's security. In the light of the Russian threat on the border with Ukraine, more and more MEPs are calling for decisive action against Russia, including additional sanctions. “We expect the best, we prepare for the worst,” Borell said.","""The hysteria of the West on this topic shows mainly the envy of some European cities and countries towards Africa and the Middle East, whose sovereignty and independence have been forced to be recognized in the past,"" the Russian Foreign Ministry said. As they said, the European Union has thus called into question the sovereign right of these members of the United Nations to an independent domestic and foreign policy. ""Russia reserves the right to respond to these hostile actions by the EU,"" they added.
EU foreign ministers on Monday approved sanctions against a group of Russian Wagner mercenaries for serious human rights abuses in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Mozambique. The package of sanctions concerns three other legal entities and eight individuals, including the alleged commander, former officer of the Russian military intelligence company Gru Dimitri Utkin.
The Wagner group recruited, trained and sent private military operatives to conflict areas around the world to incite violence, plunder natural resources and intimidate civilians in violation of international law, reads the justification for the sanctions.
Russia's foreign ministry has also denied Western allegations that the Wagner Group is acting in conflict zones on behalf of the Kremlin. According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, private military companies are not under the control of official Russian authorities.
At the meeting of foreign ministers, the Wagner group was described as a Russian paramilitary organization or private security company, which was actually run by businessman Yevgeny Prigogine, a close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Borrell on Russia: We expect the best, we prepare for the worst
Meanwhile, Putin told the Finnish president that he wanted to start negotiations with the United States and NATO immediately in order to establish international legal guarantees for the country's security, the Kremlin said. At the same time, he accused the Ukrainian leadership of increasingly using heavy weapons in the fight against pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, in violation of the Minsk peace agreements.
Russia is demanding that NATO stop expanding towards the East and deploy weapons to neighboring countries, including Ukraine, they said. Putin also reiterated these demands in talks with French President Emmanuel Macron.
Western countries, meanwhile, have expressed concern over the build-up of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine. There are already about 100,000 of them there, and according to some estimates, the invasion is expected by the end of January. The Union is working to reduce these tensions and is betting on diplomacy, but is prepared to react sharply in the event of aggression, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell told the European Parliament in Strasbourg.
He explained that the EU was working to prevent the crisis from escalating further, which could lead to military conflict. “We are in a preventive mode,” he illustrated the current approach. They look at different scenarios that could happen in the coming days or weeks to have a ready answer for each of them. ""We expect the best, but we are preparing for the worst,"" he said, adding: ""If the situation in Ukraine deteriorates, there should be no doubt that we are ready to respond.""
He noted that a renewed aggression against Ukraine, such as the one during the occupation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, would have serious political consequences and high political and economic costs for Russia. The EU has in the past imposed several packages of sanctions on Russia over the annexation of Crimea and the support of separatists in eastern Ukraine.
In today's debate, several deputies called for decisive action against Russia, including additional sanctions, as these are, as they pointed out, the only language that Moscow understands. They see Russia as a threat to the stability not only of Ukraine and neighboring countries, but also of the EU. Some MEPs also called for an end to cooperation on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which only increases the EU's dependence on Russia.
Russia rejects the West's accusations and insists that its policy is peaceful and that the problem is NATO's expansion to the East, or that it cannot agree to Ukraine's accession to NATO, as this would jeopardize its security. In a conversation with US President Joe Biden last week, Putin demanded legal assurances from the West that this would not happen."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/nova-zaslisanja-pred-komisijo-ki-preiskuje-vmesavanja-v-delo-policije.html,'Police Directors General under this government are merely obedient executors of the governing policy',"Former head of the uniformed police sector at the Ljubljana Police Administration Dejan Čulk and former head of the National Police Administration were questioned before the parliamentary commission of inquiry into possible political responsibility of public officials on suspicion of inadmissible political interference in the work of the Police Director General of Police Robert Ferenc. The chairman of the commission, Rudi Medved, said that the testimonies so far confirmed the commission's suspicions and said that the directors general of the Slovenian police under this government were merely ""obedient executors of the ruling policy"". As he pointed out, the testimonies also prove that the representatives of the profession in the police have no say.","""The directors of the Police under this government are the executors of the current policy,"" said the chairman of the commission, Rudi Medved, who believes that this is also happening at the cost of professionalism. This is shown by the commission's findings so far, he says. ""Directors pulled in politics at key moments, at the expense of the profession."" He described the staffing as ""brutal"".
According to him, Anton Travner, Andrej Jurič and Anton Olaj, as general directors of the police, ""pulled at politics at key moments, always at the expense of the profession"". ""That is why the Slovenian police have a literally brutal staffing, moving people from one end to the other, like chess pieces,"" Medved is convinced.
Security checks are not yet being carried out, he believes. “Testimonials show that this is a steady pattern,” he said. ""Immediately after the appearance of this government, there was a demand to hire a criminal who had previously lost his job due to inappropriate behavior in the workplace,"" Medved claims. The employment of the criminal was allegedly opposed by a ""chain of people"", both the service of the director general of the police and the sector for internal security and integrity. The then v. d. According to Medved, Director General Jurič agreed with the profession, but was succeeded by a new Director General of Police.
There were even more who opposed everything. ""But in the end, Olaj knelt under pressure and trampled on all the criteria that apply to employment in the Slovenian police. Who can force the director to do that? Politics! And there are many such cases."" Due to the mentioned case, the then head of the sector for internal security and integrity is also expected to resign.
""The profession has no words left,"" Medved is convinced. He also pointed out that the government did not take into account the opinion of the profession when preparing the amendment to the law on the organization and work of the police. ""The profession was against, and Interior Minister Aleš Hojs insisted."" Medved believes that the director of the Police should have stopped this - but he did not do that. ""All in all, it is to the detriment of around 8,000 police employees who are worried about the situation and who do not want to seal that the Slovenian police is the police of the SDS party,"" Medved said.
According to him, the interrogations of witnesses so far prove that ""even at lower levels in the police, people do not have their own opinion, but carefully adapt it to what the ruling politics tells them"". This is also confirmed by the interrogation of the head of the operational staff, who led the police intervention at the demonstrations on October 5, he stressed. On the one hand, he is attracting a politician who was ""enthusiastic about the excessive use of coercive means"", and on the other hand, when asked about the results of internal control, he expressed doubts whether everything was done in accordance with the police profession. .
""There is a sense of self-questioning in such testimonies, but on the other hand there is a feeling that people are scared and, of course, do not dare to express their opinion,"" says Medved. He is still convinced that individuals employed in the system itself are afraid for their jobs and therefore shift the blame to someone else, or make excuses that it is necessary to wait for additional results of the internal investigation. Sam estimates that the commission, set up by the police itself, was clear when it found out that the protests on October 5 ""involved an unusually unusual excessive use of coercive means"".
According to Medved, the interim report prepared by the commission of inquiry will record the findings of the hearings, which indicate that allegations of political pressure, political staffing and interference in criminal investigations have been confirmed, as well as in the founding acts. parliamentary commissions. However, the commission will fine one of the witnesses because it did not want to answer. ""Let this be a lesson to all who come to hearings on parliamentary committees.""
Last week, after questioning police chief Anton Olaj and former director Tatjana Bobnar, Medved said that the examination of witnesses confirmed that politics was behind the staffing of the police. According to him, the influence on the actions and thinking of the Police leadership could hardly be more evident.
According to Medved, the examination of witnesses before the commission of inquiry clearly showed that ""the leadership of the Slovenian police is trying in every way to create the impression that the situation within the entire police system is almost ideal"". At the hearing, Olaj referred to the results of internal climate measurements in the Slovenian police, Medved explained in a statement for the media after the session of the parliamentary commission.
However, as he pointed out, the representatives of the two police unions, which together unite almost 8,000 employees in the Slovenian police, gave a different opinion. However, when they said that the situation in the police was apathetic, that the situation in the system was the worst since Slovenia's independence, according to Medved, the director general of the police issued a reprimand or warning before terminating their employment.
Olaj claimed before the commission that he did not dismiss anyone from the police during his tenure, which, according to Medved, is true only because people leave voluntarily on their own. He is convinced that this is also confirmed by the departures of the former director general of the Ljubljana Police Administration, Boštjan Glavič, and the former head of the operational staff, Nermin Isić.
According to him, the interrogation also showed that Olaj does not know what the former heads of individual units are currently doing in the police, ""who were put in politics by the famous working group for migration and backwardness"". The Director General of Police told the members of the commission that the individuals are enthusiastic because they see new challenges in these jobs, new career opportunities and the opportunity to educate young police officers. As Medved explained, the truth is different, which was also confirmed by Bobnar at today's hearing. No one, except in part the former head of the National Investigation Office, Darko Muženič, lectures at the police academy. ""But they are in Tacen, where there are these special rooms for reflection of those former police chiefs who do not like the ruling politicians,"" Medved notes."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/evropa-se-naprej-zaostruje-migrantsko-politiko.html,"After the tragic death of a girl: Despite many deaths, Europe is tightening its migration policy","The tragic death of a Turkish girl who drowned in the Dragonja River raises the question of European migration policy. Non-governmental organizations warn that these migrants, who are looking for a brighter future for themselves and their families in Europe, are being forced to cross borders illegally on the way to their final destination. However, European political rhetoric is intensifying. At his last meeting with the interior ministers of the EU member states, Minister Hojs described the joint statement, which closes the doors of Europe to migration flows, as one of the greatest successes of the Slovenian presidency.","Aigul Hakimova arrived in Slovenia from Kyrgyzstan two decades ago. Legally - for study. She is now helping those in Europe who are looking for a brighter future for themselves, just as she once did. ""It strikes me when I see that there is a privileged world that closes its eyes and closes its eyes to people in need,"" says a member of the InfoColp initiative.
The tragic death of the 10-year-old - her body was found by divers on Saturday at the bottom of the Dragonja River - raises many questions. Also what drives a mother with four children on a long and dangerous journey from Turkey to northern Europe. ""These are people who have nothing to lose. People who hope to move if they move. To give their children a better future. So this is the only way to take the decision into their own hands,"" Hakimova explains. .
The Schengen visa, which legally opens the doors of Europe, is virtually unattainable for them, as it is a demanding procedure, Hakimova added. Therefore, with the help of smugglers or on their own, they prefer to set off en masse on dangerous, destructive thousands of kilometers long routes. ""More migrants have lost their lives worldwide this year than last year, when 4,236 died. More than 45,400 migrants have died along the way since 2014,"" said United Nations spokeswoman Stéphane Dujarric.
A Kurdish migrant traveled for more than a month. After being caught for a long time in impossible conditions on the Polish-Belarusian border, the young man finally arrived in Germany, but died soon after. Europe is tightening its migration policy.
While Belarus is playing political games with human lives and measuring strength with the European Union, members are one after another expressing support for Poland, which continues to keep migrants at the border. Minister Hoys considers the common European position, which opposes uncontrolled migration, to be a great success of our presidency. ""This was also a turning point for me. After many years, the interior ministers agreed that Europe's door to migration flows will not be open, as it was in 2015,"" said Interior Minister Aleš Hojs.
""I don't know if this is a success of the Slovenian presidency. We are talking about people who travel for a long time, a few years, a few months and need help. And it would be good if the countries would allow them to do so,"" Hakimova said. Today, on the Balkan route, we are witnessing a vicious circle of chain return, adds Hakimova - from Slovenia to Croatia, and from there back to Bosnia and Herzegovina."

In addition, it creates new jobs, contributes to less waste and allows more reuse of beverage packaging and quality recycling. The deposit system means that the consumer pays the amount or deposit upon the purchase of a beverage for packaging, which is refunded upon return to the collection point. The LMŠ party advocated the establishment of such a system, and the Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning Andrej Vizjak also expressed his support for this idea.","""In LMŠ we believe that in Slovenia we urgently need to develop modern practices of recovery and recycling of waste, which will not only save due to lower taxes to the European Union, but will be able to create new products from waste and thus increase added value,"" they wrote. press release.
The renewed system of own resources, introduced in the EU, which also consists of national contributions for non-recycled plastic packaging waste, means that this waste will be a financial burden in addition to the environmental problem. ""One kilogram of non-recycled plastic packaging waste will cost us 0.8 euros. Slovenia will pay more than 10 million euros for packaging waste this year. Based on the adopted budget of the European Union for 2022, Slovenia will deduct non-recycled plastic packaging waste next year. more than 11 million euros, ""they wrote.
According to them, the proposal of the new law on environmental protection brings some good solutions, especially in the part that regulates t. i. extended producer responsibility, but they want even more. ""At LMŠ, we are convinced that we must take a step forward and take into account the legislative proposal of the non-governmental organization Eco Circle and establish a deposit system for the management of packaging waste,"" they emphasized. It is a proven solution that can achieve more than 90 percent of separately collected quality material usable for the production of new packaging.
The LMŠ will submit a request for a general debate on the draft law on environmental protection, as they want all parliamentarians to contribute their proposals, views and concerns to the establishment of the bail system. With a broad political consensus, it will be possible to design an even more efficient, transparent and efficient system, thus helping to maintain a clean environment and reduce pollution, they emphasized.
Andrej Vizjak supports the idea
The Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning, Andrej Vizjak, was acquainted with the initiative for the establishment of a deposit system for the packaging of beverages, such as bottles and cans, prepared by the Eco Circle Association. He supports the idea and will try to implement it in the process of adopting a new law on environmental protection, the ministry said.
According to Vizjak, the initiative is in line with the new law on environmental protection, so the provisions in the parliamentary procedure with amendments will be included in this law. At the same time, the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning will prepare a decree that will more specifically regulate this area, they announced. Vizjak supports bail solutions especially for bottles and cans.
The deposit system means that the consumer pays an amount or a deposit when purchasing a beverage for packaging, which is refunded when the packaging is returned to the collection point. Such a system is already known in many European countries and makes an additional contribution to more efficient collection of packaging waste to achieve environmental goals.
As explained by Aljoša Petek from the Legal Center for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, who helped the association prepare amendments to the proposal for a new law on environmental protection, Slovenian legislation provides for a bail system, but this specificity requires the cooperation of both producers and sellers. There is no such participation in the existing law, so the new law sent by the government for parliamentary consideration requires a small change. The Eco Circle has already drafted a proposal for a new regulation in this area.
Let's remember
The Eco Circle Association sent a proposal to the Ministry of the Environment and political parties for legislative changes that could establish a deposit system in Slovenia for the collection of beverage packaging waste. They are convinced that this brings many benefits, but the cooperation of all is needed.
For 15 years we have been observing the chaos with waste, which is doing damage not only to nature but also to the budget. Valuable materials in waste are disappearing from Slovenia. tentacles to garbage lobbies and environmental crime, ""said Uroš Macerl, president of the Eco Circle, at a press conference.
The deposit system for bottles, cans and bottles is known in ten European countries, and in 15 it will be established in the coming years. The last country to take this step is Austria.
As explained by the head of the Let's Close the Circle campaign Erika Oblak, research shows that countries with a bail system achieve the goals of European legislation related to packaging. The European Directive on Disposable Plastic Products, adopted in 2019, sets out, among other things, collection and recycling targets, according to which countries will have to collect 90% of their bottles separately by 2030. In addition, the new bottles will have to contain at least 30 percent recyclable, and by 2030, countries will also have to recycle at least 55 percent of all plastic packaging.
The Eco Circle wants the deposit system to be the next step after the Clean Slovenia campaign, as most bottles are thrown away along the roads. The association also conducted a survey, which showed that out of almost 1,900 respondents, the deposit system would be supported by over 99 percent of respondents. However, because of all the advantages it brings, they are convinced that it should also be supported by politics. “Excuses that this is not possible are not true,” Macerl was clear."

This is opposed by Matjaž Fortič, a member of the Supervisory Board of Pošta Slovenije, who was allegedly pressured by the secretary of the Konkretno party. Specifically, this was allegedly requested by Počivalšek's advisor Katarina Bovha.

Fortič rejected Rebolj and allegedly informed the Slovenian State Holding (SDH), which is the umbrella manager of state property, about inadmissible political pressures on supervisors.
According to Rebolj, they met with Fortič and discussed his relationship with the party. ""I informed him that he had lost confidence due to some hidden things. He left the party at his own request,"" he explained online, adding that he suggested resigning when he resigned.

SSH confirmed that on December 8, they received a report from one of the members of the company's supervisory board with a state capital investment, which contains allegations of illegal pressure against him.
""SSH considers inadmissible any unauthorized pressures on the independent performance of functions in the bodies of companies or pressures with other inadmissible content, which are contrary to applicable legislation and good corporate governance practice,"" they wrote, adding that they have already considered the receipt.
As they wrote, in the event of requests for illegal and unethical conduct or influence, SSH expects all members of the supervisory boards to respond in accordance with applicable law.

Renko: The interim General Manager enjoys the trust of the Supervisory Board of Pošta Slovenije
Ervin Renko, President of the Supervisory Board of Pošta Slovenije, said that the Supervisory Board of Pošta Slovenije could not comment on specific allegations of pressure on the supervisor, who is a member of the Pošta Supervisory Board. Therefore, he distances himself from all public statements in the media related to this topic, and any such attempts at independence of the members of the Supervisory Board are considered inappropriate and inadmissible.
""The Supervisory Board is a collective body that supervises the management of operations, and each member is responsible for his work and performance of functions with sufficient due diligence. The latter is also reflected in the quick response of the Post's Supervisory Board to the situation in the matter of replenishing the company's management, which was left without two members in a short time, ""said Renko.

And that the public will be informed in a timely manner by the election, and they strongly reject any prior discrediting of candidates.
Failure to meet the conditions for the director of Pošta Slovenije?
Fortič opposed the appointment of Kokot for a full term because he allegedly did not meet the conditions. According to the Articles of Association of Pošta Slovenije, the General Manager must have five years of managerial or comparable experience in large companies. Kokot's resume, which he attached to his candidacy, shows that he has been a self-employed person for more than five years and since 2014 the executive director of the family company FlawlessCode, which has 24 employees and just under two million euros in revenue. By no means are these large companies.
Kokot, who took the leading position at Pošta Slovenije in March this year and succeeded Boris Novak, is considered the cadre of SDS Secretary General Borut Dolanc. The ruling party has been working for six months to get a full term. In July this year, this was opposed by the Supervisory Board, which at the time was still headed by Franc Mihelič from the NSi quotas. Some of the supervisors already wanted to dismiss Kokota, the SDS and SMC prevented the replacement, while Mihelič and Aleš Buležan, appointed in the DeSUS quota, resigned. In the resignation statement, they wrote that they were resigning for personal reasons.
SSH then appointed two more members from the ruling party's quota to the supervisory board: Igor Škrinjar and Niko Samac. Renko, who is also Dolanč's staff, took over the management of the Supervisory Board of Pošta Slovenije.
There are already pressures on the legality of the dismissal of three senior employees of the management board: Franc Predikaka, Andrej Masla and Uroš Fonovič. In September, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board, headed by Fortič, obtained the opinion of lawyer Stojan Zdolšek, according to which Kokot allegedly violated his powers and acted in violation of the law. Kokot then turned to lawyer Franc Matoz, long-time lawyer Janez Janša and the SDS, and with his help put pressure on his supervisors, as Matoz found that Buležan and Fortič had committed a crime by ordering an opinion from Zdolšek. Later, according to Uncensored, Matoz was preparing a legal opinion with which the supervisors of Pošta Slovenije could substantiate that Kokot has five years of managerial or comparable experience in large companies.
Since last year, Kokot has also been the Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Borzen, a domestic electricity market operator. But in no case is it a company, but a public institution.
The course of events is very reminiscent of the affair from 2019, when the secretary of the LMŠ party Brane Kralj called the first supervisor of the company Uradni list Irena Prijović and pressured her to choose Igor Šoltes, former president of the Court of Audit, as director. Prijović reported the pressures to SSH and the Commission for the Prevention of Corruption. The then Prime Minister Marjan Šarec then denied that he had ordered the party's secretary to intervene, but Kralj then had to say goodbye.
Prijović explained to STA that according to her case, the association and the CCP prepared a protocol for the conduct of members of supervisory boards in the implementation of political and other pressures and unethical influence and independent decision-making, and offered members of supervisory boards a way to make such reports. ""If we do not respond appropriately to such attempts, we will not be able to protect the company's interest in decision-making, which can also lead to personal liability and criminal liability. Therefore, we warn members of supervisory boards .
At the same time, he says that he wants more applications to the CCP, as this would significantly increase the policy risk for such actions, even to the extent that it would become extremely risky behavior for them. The problem, however, is if we have members of the supervisory boards who understand their function on the supervisory board by acting in accordance with policy instructions and are part of power bargaining.
Two years ago, her application was wrongly publicized as a revelation to the media, as she did not want to, but it was basically an act to protect the independence of the personnel process in the company where she was the first supervisor. However, from the point of view of informing the public, it agrees that its interest is justified in such cases. ""This is also due to the fact that all CCP assessments are publicly published and are the reference point of the assessment for future such cases. But for the implementation of the personnel procedure, which I wanted to protect with my actions, it would be better not to take place in an atmosphere exceptional media exposure, attempts to discredit society, me personally and direct threats and pressures, ""Prijović explained."

The party will be founded at the congress in January 2022, and its presidency will be double. They will advocate for green energy, the environment, equality, the full inclusion of women in all pores of society and social justice.","
According to Zgojnik, the party's position and program are based on four pillars. These are the environment, democracy and transparency, equality and social justice, and creativity. As she said, power belongs to the people. They will not destroy the economy, but ""give it a new wind of green energy, clean water, improve food quality, prevent waste and provide jobs that people will be proud of"".
""Social justice for us means accessible public health, social justice for us is represented by fair taxes and also the fight against corruption and tax evasion,"" she said. According to her, they are not afraid of these topics, but they believe that a society that does not deal with them will not succeed. She emphasized that people are actions and act openly and inclusively, transparently and democratically.
""Vesna lives in Slovenia, she is full of life, she loves nature, walks in the mountains, cyclists. Vesna is also the one who fights for her ideas, for tomorrow, for the future, enjoys the discussion, seeks solutions,"" Zgojznikova described the party. .
Uroš Macerl said that the party is being built from the bottom up and that it is not a party of one face, it is not a party of Urša or Uroš. “We believe that with cultural dialogue, knowledge, a vision of credibility and the experience we have gained at the national and local levels, we can pursue policy inclusively and differently,” he said. He stressed that they are neither left nor right, but green.
He stressed that their goal is to improve the environment in which we live. ""We want to live in a free, open and responsible society, where the media, state policy and institutions work independently and for the good of all of us. We want to live with guaranteed equality and social justice,"" Macerl said.
The new party was also supported by the President of the European Green Party, Thomas Waitz, who said in a statement that large and successful green parties in Europe are built on the initiatives of civil society, women's and peace movements. ""This project is built on a civil initiative, led by people who are respected, and over the years have proven that they are serious about investing their energy and time in protecting the environment and fighting for the rights of citizens and the environment throughout Slovenia."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/zacetek-predvolilne-tekme-glavni-cilj-je-nezasedena-politicna-sredina.html,The start of the election campaign: the main goal is an unoccupied political environment,"After weeks of evasion, Gen-I’s former first husband has revealed that he is returning to politics. He is announcing his first steps before the new year. And who will all be vying for the votes of voters in a good four months who are not happy with the current party offer and the sharp division between right and left? Is the word middle really the one that secures entry into parliament? This is where all emerging and emerging parties and movements seem to be targeting.","New parties and new movements, and the main goal is an unoccupied political environment, where there is obviously more space, public opinion polls show. But the middle ground is already an exhausted concept in this flood of new customers, say Aleksandra Pivec's party Our Country.
""Because experience has shown that before the election, everyone is in the middle, and then no one else. So, of course, our goal is neutrality, the middle, that is, to withdraw from some polarization,"" explains Dejan Podgoršek.
It is this polarization of existing political parties that, according to the latest Mediana poll, will scatter voters away from the far left and the far right. Which is also what Robert Golob wants, who is still looking for the critical mass to which he would belong, as he feels that times are such that he has to get involved in politics.
""If you ask me if I will run, it is absolutely too early to talk about it, because I believe that many other things are more important before that. I believe in the power of the collective and the power of people's and civil initiatives and movements. ""I expect that before the new year we will take the first steps at the level of a platform that should connect these like-minded people, and that we will be able to make it public on the basis of this platform,"" says Golob.
The goal he states is to change the political culture, which is emphasized by all newly formed or emerging people. Also the party Konkretno, which will be part of the Connect Slovenia movement. ""We are not looking for opponents, we are looking for allies, we are not looking for things that divide us, but those that can connect us,"" said Alojz Kovšca.
The attempt to create a widely acceptable environment is in full swing, which is also shown by the meeting, such as the one that took place at the Mons Hotel, the Connect Slovenia movement, the Nova Slovenija and Naša Dežela parties. The latter go to the polls on their own. ""We have our own program, our own values, we did not discuss our values, programs at these meetings ... It seemed to us that it was mainly about pre-election mathematics and we are not interested in that. But after the elections, as we said , we will have to talk and make compromises, alliances, ""Podgoršek continues.
There are also the Green Party of Jure Leben and the party of Uroš Macerl and Urška Zgojznik, which will be presented to the public today.
Igor Zorčič's party is expected to come to life by the end of the year. There is also Andrej Magajna's New Social Democracy party.
Recent research, however, shows that in the presence of new parties and movements, existing parties would lose voters.
'The middle is currently a niche market'
Analysts Rok Čakš and Aljaž Pengov Bitenc also spoke about this in the 24UR ZVEČER show. Peng's Bitenc sees Robert Golob at the moment as someone who put his name into the game, but left enough room for maneuver to dictate the terms of his political engagement. This, in turn, will be highly dependent on how the center-left coalition performs in the run-up to the elections. ""At the moment, I see him as a compromise candidate for the new prime minister after the elections, if there were no prominent leaders among the KUL members who would push the party and the coalition forward.""
Čakš also points out that it is far from clear whether Golob will actually run in the elections. ""I think his strategy is to consolidate the ground for entry with skilful marketing appearances and press conferences, but at the same time he leaves room for retreat. If we were caricaturing, we would say he is standing on the shore of an icy lake and testing with one foot , whether the ice is strong enough to carry it without getting your feet wet. ""
Pengov added that there is a lot of traffic on the political scene at the moment and it is clear that not everything will work out. Among such parties, I would include Zorčič, for example. ""Golob is certainly a man around whom certain political players or people would start gravitating. He would bring some unrest to relations on the left, but I don't know if this would affect the attitude of voters towards the SDS party. The question is whether Golob would take over voters. KUL or potential undecided voters, often mistakenly called center voters. ""
Čakš also says that the center is currently a market niche, as politics has become very polarized during this term. ""They are excluding themselves and part of the electorate has had enough of that, they want different policies and a different approach. Here they see new actors, as well as NSi, a new opportunity.""
According to Peng, the self-belief that the middle ground is the currency for victory shows the absence of a political idea and is a ""fairy tale told by Slovenian politics"". According to him, everyone who has no interest, desire or knowledge to form a political alternative is in the middle. According to him, the Green Party has potential because Macerl and Zgojznikova have some mileage from the water referendum, although he thinks he wants to ""ride the green wave"" that has swept Europe recently.
Regarding all green parties, Čakš also said that they have two problems - a party is difficult to succeed if it is tied to only one topic, and another problem is the ""inflation"" of green parties, which is being ridden by various actors. ""They are fragmented and this drastically reduces their real power or potential for a breakthrough.""
Mediana's latest poll showed the Let's Connect Slovenia Movement, Our Country by Aleksandra Pivec and Jure Lebno's party considerable support, together they would get a good 16 percent of the vote, at the expense of SDS, NSi and SD. Above all, it is interesting that the SDS, which is considered the party with the most loyal electoral base, would lose almost a third of its support on this account. Is such a large-scale relocation of voters to new parties possible in the upcoming elections?
Peng's Bitenc says no. ""Anyone who decides this is either not knowing what they are doing or having some agenda behind them. Trends to watch, we are in the very early stages and any predictions are ungrateful,"" he said. However, Čakš believes that such support can be an incentive for these parties. ""How much we could pinch off the existing parties is very double-edged. The SDS electoral base is extremely solid. I don't believe that the new actors will do anything but scrape a percentage or two of these parties. They will have to look elsewhere."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/golob-se-vraca-v-politiko.html,Robert Golob is returning to politics,"Four months before the parliamentary elections, there is already a real fight for the voters on the political stage. Robert Golob, who has so far skilfully avoided the question of whether he is returning to politics by answering that he will not form his own party, has now revealed that he has finally decided that he has enough political passivity and it is time to return to political game.","Robert Golob confirmed to us that he is definitely back in politics. His decision on this is final regardless of how the court decides on the management of the Gen-I administration, he told Delo. Due to the non-extension of the director's term at the helm of Gen-i, all Slovenes now know Golob.
Golob told 24UR ZVEČER that he believes that every individual must or has the right to be politically active: ""I myself have been politically active in the past and at this moment I also realized that times are such that we all we know it, or we can, engage in it politically. And that applies to me as well. ""
As he pointed out in the conversation, he deliberately and deliberately does not even think of joining any party at the moment: ""I believe that a platform should be established with a common goal and this common goal is to change the political culture in the country. ""So I don't want us to be handicapped in advance in setting up this platform by bonding with existing customers. I believe in a platform that comes from people.""
As he added, he wants to join a large enough critical mass of like-minded people who will share the same values ​​and have the same goal: ""If such a critical mass is established and I hope it will be in the coming months, then I will think about it, that I go to the polls with them. If such a mass, which I do not see today, is not established, then we will find that we stay where we are, that is, with the party democracy. ""
He pointed out that I am ready to do anything to change the political culture in order to expel the hatred and strife that is now present in politics from this country. If it all turns out in the end that I have to join the party in the end, well, that's the way it will be, nothing. ""
Will his name be on the ballot paper on April 24? ""I have no idea. I'm not even bothered by this at the moment. If you ask me if I will run, it is absolutely too early to talk about it, because I believe that many other things are more important before that, I believe in the power of the collective initiatives and movements. And first I will be active and engaged in this area, ""he says.
There have also been speculations that he is linked to Igor Zorčič when forming a new party, but says that he is talking to many people: ""I emphasize that I deliberately avoid contact with existing parties and people from the existing political system. I just visited Mr. Zorčič because I was in parliament after a long time. And that's all. ""
Golob has repeatedly said that he will not establish his own party. ""I have been politically active, not since 14 days ago, but since 1998, and I will continue to be politically active. I will use every opportunity to express my views. If you want to be successful in politics in the long run, you need a critical mass of like-minded people. similar values. If there is a mass that believes in the same values ​​as me and my colleagues and lives them, then I am ready to join such a group. But we are still very far there, ""he said on the show Ena na Ena .
Fight for the voters
On the political stage, as we have already reported, it is becoming more and more diverse. New political parties are emerging, and a real struggle for the electorate is taking place. New parties are already emerging alongside the existing ones, and there will obviously be a lot of struggle for dominance in the political environment.
By the end of the year, a party will be formed under the auspices of National Assembly Speaker Igor Zorčič. Some mostly non-parliamentary parties, which have so far been more or less on the political right, also intend to form a central political bloc.
The formation of another party, the new Green Party Green Vesna, will be officially announced on Friday. For now, it is known that Uroš Macerl from Ekokrog and Urša Zgojznik from Ekologov bez meja will be included.
The party of the Modern Center (SMC), led by Zdravko Počivalšek, and the Economically Active Party (GAS) Alojza Kovšce, officially confirmed the merger into a new party called Konkretno on Saturday. Počivalšek will be its president and Kovšca vice president."

Milanovic stated that there are genocides of various kinds. In his opinion, the massacre of Bosniaks in Srebrenica in 1995 is at a lower level than the Holocaust.","Former Social Democratic Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic is known for his harsh and often controversial statements. A few days ago, he struck after the tragic events from the end of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, when Bosnian Serb forces killed about 8,000 Bosniaks in Srebrenica. The massacre has also been officially described by international courts as genocide.
Milanovic does not dispute this, but he clearly believes that there are various forms of genocide and that some of them, including the Srebrenica massacre, rank lower than others, such as the Holocaust. Milanović also said that a new name should be found for more serious crimes. “If everything is genocide, then we need to find a new name for what the Nazis did to the Jews in World War II,” he said. He believes that the events in Srebrenica cannot be equated with the Holocaust or the events in the Croatian Jasenovac concentration camp. ""5,000, 8,000 or 80,000 victims are not the same. It is not the same if something happens in gas cells or with axes,"" the Croatian president continued.
The chairman of the Bosniak minority council in Croatia, Armin Hodžić, is concerned that Milanović's statement underestimates the crime committed in Srebrenica. Relatives of the Srebrenica victims have accused the president of denying genocide. The Bosniak member of the three-member presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sefik Dzaferovic, even described Milanovic as a hopeless case.
18 Croatian non-governmental organizations also believe that he crossed the border this time. And to sound like a nationalist on the dark side of history. The newspaper Večernji list wrote that Milanović, although presenting himself as a left-liberal politician, currently acts exclusively as a right-wing and nationalist ruler, in a more modern sovereignist and populist version of a right-wing politician.
Criticism of Milanovic's statement on the 30th anniversary of the murder of a Serbian family in Zagreb
Milanovic also caused further excitement by commenting on the 30th anniversary of the murder of the Serbian Zec family in Zagreb in December 1991. A unit of later convicted war criminal Tomislav Mercep shot his father, mother and 12-year-old girl at the time. the most shameful chapters of recent Croatian history.
In this regard, the Croatian President stated that this is a horrible case, but that there are much more serious war stories. The family has already received compensation from the state, but what else do they need, he said, adding that the Croatian state had nothing to do with the murder anyway.
Milanovic's anger was met today by the European and Croatian left, who, according to him, failed the stress test of fundamental human freedoms in the covida-19 pandemic, reports the Croatian news agency Hina. ""No one is advocating for fundamental human freedoms, everyone is afraid. This is about fundamental rights slipping out of our hands like sand. This is a very dangerous time,"" he said, adding that he expected the left to be the loudest on the issue. and responsible, but proved to be conformist and frightened.
At the same time, he referred to the referendum initiative of the conservative opposition party Most, which opposes the powers of the Croatian Civil Protection Headquarters during the epidemic and, among other things, wants citizens to decide in a referendum on abolishing mandatory certificates. According to Milanović, this is the essence - the fundamental human freedoms and who and when can restrict them in Croatia. According to him, this is only a parliament, which is already the case, but this is brutally ignored. He wondered where the left was in this referendum."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/znanost-in-tehnologija/facebook-napacno-identificiral-na-tisoce-politicnih-oglasov.html,Facebook misidentified thousands of political ads,"The social network Facebook has misidentified thousands of ads that have been mislabeled as political or overlooked as a political ad. This was shown by a new study in which they examined 33.8 million ads on Facebook. As researchers warn, the mistake could lead to political manipulation.","Researchers from the Belgian University of KU Leuven and the University of New York (NYU) examined 33.8 million ads on the social network Facebook, which were active on the network from July 2020 to February this year. The team said it was the first known study to assess in such large numbers how effective Facebook's system for enforcing political advertising rules is.
Facebook imposes stricter conditions for paid advertisements in the field of social issues, elections and politics, which also means the promotion of political candidates. Such ads appear with a note revealing the payer. Ads that they find to be political but not labeled as such are removed from the network.
However, researchers in a new study found that the network erred by as much as 83 percent in examining whether an ad was political. This includes 117,000 cases where the system of this technology giant did not label the ad as political, even though it was, and 40,000 cases where the ad was mistakenly labeled political.
They also noted that Facebook's detection system is based primarily on keywords in ads. It is an automated process, although employees also play an important role in this.
At the time of studying the company now called Meta, major elections were also taking place, including in the United States and Brazil. Researchers have therefore warned that mislabelling ads gives an opportunity for manipulation. “When Facebook misidentifies advertisers who incorrectly tag their ads, especially those malicious can spread false information in this way,” they added.
The survey also found that most of the misidentified ads were outside the United States. The worst was with ad recognition in Malaysia, where 45 percent of ads were missed. In Macedonia, Argentina, Turkey, France, Serbia and Portugal, this share was one quarter."

A new agreement has been reached to extend the 'home roaming' service until 2032.","The agreement reached is extremely important for millions of Europeans. Since 2017, when the first regulation on mobile roaming came into force, EU citizens have benefited extensively from the abolition of roaming charges and the rules set out as 'home roaming'. This policy has enabled millions of consumers and businesses to reap the benefits of the digital single market in their daily lives: that users have access to mobile services (calls, short messages (SMS) or data transfer) when traveling within the EU at no extra cost. adoption of the agreement recorded at the Ministry of Public Administration.
As the validity of the 2017 regulation is limited to 30 June 2022, without an extension of the regulation from July next year, many European consumers and businesses would find themselves in an unimaginable situation today when operators roam in another EU Member State in addition to the domestic price. mobile service charges extra for providing roaming services.
The 'home roaming' service has now been extended until 2032, allowing EU citizens to continue to make calls, send text messages (SMS) or use mobile data in the same way as at home, even after the current regulation expires. The revised Roaming Regulation adjusts the maximum wholesale prices to ensure the sustainable provision of retail roaming services at domestic prices to operators across the EU.
The revised regulation also includes measures to ensure a good user experience in terms of service quality and access to emergency services, including for people with special needs. It increases the transparency of services, which may be subject to additional costs, and will protect users from high bills due to unintentional roaming on non-terrestrial mobile networks when on ferries or aircraft."

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has been named the most influential person in Europe. The list was divided into three parts: performers, dreamers and distractors. The president of the European Football Association, Aleksander Ceferin, was also on the list of the latter.","This time, as they pointed out at Politic, everything revolves around a central theme: Who will deal with the problems left by Angela Merkel?
""The Politico 28 list is not a list of awards. We are not raising glasses for those on the list,"" they wrote. They explained that they instead relied on the expertise of their newsroom and the views of diplomats and politicians to provide an informative insight into who are currently in the best position to shape European policy next year.
As in previous years, the list was divided into three sections: performers (those with executive power), dreamers (those who present ideas that lead debates) and distractors (those who are in the best position to change the game in unexpected ways). . ""At the top of the list sits the strongest person in Europe,"" they wrote.
The president of UEFA was also among the disturbers. ""As president of UEFA, the governing body of European football, Alexander Ceferin is at the heart of the battle for the future of the world's most popular entertainment. After facing some of Europe's biggest clubs over what he called a 'shameful, selfish' plan In the Super League, the 54-year-old is now fighting against the World Cup and is rejecting FIFA's proposal to host the World Cup every two years. ""
They added that Čeferin started at the bottom of the administrative pyramid of European football and led the futsal team in the small Slovenian town of Litija, before becoming president of the Slovenian Football Association. Now UEFA has been leading since 2016. They also reminded of the dispute with Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Janša, when they argued last spring, as Čeferin criticized Janša's handling of the coronavirus crisis, which led the Prime Minister to point to UEFA matches due to rising finger infections. , which took place during the pandemic.
""If Ceferin - a popular figure in Slovenia - ever gets tired of sports, he could always try his hand at national politics. Although he said that from his current position he can help the world more than he participates in running his homeland.""
""The composition of this year's list reflects the challenges that remain unresolved in Angela Merkel's four terms: the eurozone, growing threats such as China and known threats such as Russia, the climate crisis, migration, the harmful effects of social media, the constant fight against coronavirus."" they added at Politic. The list includes some of Europe's most prominent heads of state and government, the Prime Minister's wife, who is well-versed in public relations, a city bureaucrat who is fighting climate change, and other regional leaders. ""Several opposition figures have also been included in the list, who could, if they succeed in the elections, reshape the positions of their countries in Europe,"" they added.
At the top of the list of Europe's strongest figures is Mario Draghi, a politician who is best placed to occupy at least part of the space created by Merkel's arrival - albeit perhaps only temporarily, given his country's famously unstable policies. ""
28 most influential
Among the performers was the newly elected German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, the list also included French President Emmanuel Macron, Christine Lagard, European Central Bank President Frans Timmermans, European Commission Vice-President Rishi Sunak, British Finance Minister Laura Codruta Kövesi , European Chief Prosecutor, Koen Lenaerts, President of the EU Court of Justice, Maroš Šefčovič, Vice-President of the European Commission and Alexander van der Bellen, President of Austria.
The dream group was led by Anne Hidalgo, Mayor of Paris, followed by Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, Gabrielius Landsbergis, Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Eleni Myrivili, Senior Adviser to the City of Athens on Resilience and Sustainability, Péter Márki-Zay, Orban's Challenger. the upcoming elections in Hungary and the Mayor of Hódmezővásárhely, Maia Sandu, the President of Moldova, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, a former politician and Prime Minister of Denmark who draws attention to the pitfalls of social media today, Samantha Cristoforetti, an astronaut of the European Space Agency and Jeremy Farrar Wellcome trust association.
The first place among dreamers was taken by Donald Tusk, former Polish Prime Minister and President of the European Council, who returned to domestic politics, including Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, head of the World Trade Organization, Eliot Higgins, British journalist Christian Lindner, German politician, Viktor Orbán, Prime Minister of Hungary, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, Mayor of Madrid, Alexander Ceferin, President of UEFA, Carrie Johnson, political activist and wife of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Alexander Lukashenko, President of Belarus."

New parties are already emerging alongside the existing ones, and there will obviously be a lot of struggle for dominance in the political environment. By the end of the year, a party will be formed under the auspices of National Assembly Speaker Igor Zorčič. The central political bloc also intends to form some, mostly non-parliamentary parties, which have so far been more or less on the political right.","For several months now, at least in the idea, a party has been forming around the Speaker of Parliament and unaffiliated MP Igor Zorčič. So this is supposed to really happen this month. ""There is a lot of intolerance about this project, some estimate that it is procrastinating here, I don't think so. It is important that if this project continues, I must say that we are working on it, that this project is finished so that you can't jump into an empty pool, ""Zorčič said on Monday.
At the same time, there are many names that would be next to Zorčič or even the first face of the party, this week he also got together with Robert Golob. But the Zorčič family does not want to be specific to the last. ""You will see,"" Zorčič is mysterious.
What would the new Zorčič party and the possible entry of Robert Golob mean for the so-called KUL coalition? ""In the Left, we do not pay too much attention to this, I think it is crucial that the parties that are currently in this democratic opposition shape their programs and continue with their points until the elections,"" said Matej Vatovec from the Left. ""But sometimes these newcomers are a little lacking in political perspective."" ""Below the line, I welcome someone to come in the middle left,"" said Matjaž Han of the SD party.
On the other hand, calls for the creation of a political environment also come from some hitherto right-wing worldview circles. At the Mons Hotel last night, representatives of the paper met, who - as they wrote - ""address center-right, center-left and center-left voters and intend to form a so-called third, center-right political bloc.""
The idea for this came from nine initiators, such as Matej Avbelj, Ernest Petrič and Dimitrij Rupel. But Avbelj, for example, says that this does not mean active party cooperation for him and that he did not attend the meeting. However, mostly non-parliamentary parties of the Connect Slovenia movement met, as well as representatives of Nova Slovenija and Naša dežela, who otherwise go to the polls independently.
They would cooperate and connect without exclusion, they say, but they do not want to cooperate with the Left. However, it is already clear who, at least for parliament, will not run. ""I'm not going to the parliamentary elections, but I don't know about the municipal ones yet. As I will feel,"" explains Zoran Janković.

Putin insists that Russia is pursuing a ""peaceful foreign policy, but has the right to defend its security.""","""I made it clear to him that if he attacks Ukraine, there will be serious consequences, serious consequences - economic consequences that he has not seen or has not seen before,"" Joe Biden said of the conversation with Vladimir Putin.
He added that in addition to economic sanctions, a Russian attack on Ukraine would also trigger a strengthened US military presence in NATO territory in Eastern Europe. ""We will probably need to strengthen our presence in NATO countries to reassure them, especially those on the eastern edge. At the same time, I have made it clear that we will provide Ukraine with defense capabilities,"" he said.
In advance, the U.S. president reduced the threat by acknowledging that the deployment of U.S. units to defend Ukraine is out of the question because Ukraine is not a member of NATO. ""We have a moral and legal obligation to NATO allies under Article 5. This is a sacred obligation that does not extend to Ukraine,"" he added.
Paris warns Russia
After Tuesday's video conference with Putin, which did not bring much progress, Biden spoke with major US allies in Europe. ""Strong messages have been sent to Russia that a new attack on Ukraine's territorial integrity would have strategic and serious consequences,"" a conversation between the leaders of the US, France, Germany, Italy and the UK was announced by the French Foreign Ministry. T. i. the quintet of western allies ""expressed its determination that Ukraine's sovereignty must be respected,"" they added.
German government spokesman Steffen Seibert also confirmed the conversation between European leaders and Joe Biden, saying participants expressed ""their full support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" and stressed that Russia must ""reduce tensions and work for a diplomatic solution"". under t. i. Normandy format and the Minsk agreements.
Russia annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea in 2014, which was never acknowledged by the international community. In the same year, pro-Russian separatists took control of the eastern regions of Ukraine and declared independence, which also failed to gain international recognition.
Putin insists that Russia has the right to defend its security
Today, for the first time, the Russian president spoke publicly about the escalation of tensions between Russia and NATO-led NATO countries. Speaking at a news conference after meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kiriakos Mitsotakis, he insisted that Russia was pursuing a ""peaceful foreign policy but has the right to defend its security"". He, on the other hand, accused the Alliance of ""obviously provocative"" and ""least hostile"" policies towards Russia.
He did not want to give a clear answer to the question of whether he intends to send troops, which Russia has been accumulating along the border with its western neighbor for some time, to the territory of Ukraine, as this question is a provocation. He said, however, that it would be a mere ""criminal inaction"" to watch NATO move ever closer to Russia.
""We cannot be concerned about the possibility of Ukraine's accession to NATO, as this will undoubtedly be followed by the deployment of military contingents, bases and weapons that threaten us,"" he said, adding that NATO's eastward expansion was ""very sensitive for Russia."" ""question.
""This is one of the key issues when it comes to maintaining Russia's security in the medium and even long term. (...) We have talked about this all the time, including publicly, and warned our partners that (NATO enlargement) is unacceptable to us, ""Putin continued. Bidnu also said on Tuesday that Moscow was demanding legal guarantees from the West that Ukraine would not join NATO.
""Of course, each country has the right to choose the way it provides its own security that it deems most acceptable. But this must be done in a way that does not interfere with the interests of other countries and undermine their security,"" he added. .
Putin described the conversation with Biden as constructive, substantive and open, and assessed that the two would continue the dialogue.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also assessed the video conference as positive. ""I think it's a Ukrainian victory that the United States has always supported Ukraine, our sovereignty, our independence,"" he said. He added that he recognizes Bidna's special personal commitment to Ukraine. He added that he would be able to comment on the details of the talks only after a telephone conversation with the US President. Zelenski and Biden are expected to talk on the phone tomorrow.
Let's remember
Biden and Putin spoke for two hours on Tuesday, mainly about the concerns of Western allies over the accumulation of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine. There are already about 100,000 of them there, and according to some estimates, the invasion is expected by the end of January. Biden threatened Putin with major economic measures if the invasion actually happened.
Russia rejects the West's accusations and insists that its policy is peaceful and that the problem is NATO's expansion to the East, or that it cannot agree to Ukraine's entry into NATO, as this would jeopardize its security. Putin on Tuesday demanded legal assurances from the West that this would not happen."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/preiskovalka.html,"Bobnar: If politics is already knocking on the door of the Director General of the Police, then he must stay there","The current director general of the police, Anton Olaj, appeared before the parliamentary investigation commission, which is determining the possible political responsibility of public officials due to suspicion of inadmissible political interference in the work of the police and political influence on the course and outcome of pre-trial and other proceedings. Olaj had to answer questions about personnel changes, but also questions about the conduct of the police at the protests on June 25, when the police intervened at the Prešeren monument. i. yellow jacket. Commission members were also interested in the use of tear gas in the October 5 protests. After Olaj, the hearing of his predecessor Tatjana Bobnar began, but it has not been concluded at this session.","At the beginning, Olaj stated that the situation in the Slovenian Police is very good and rejected the accusations of both police unions. He also asserted that the alleged fear of police station chiefs, who under the Law on the Organization and Work of the Police had become mere acting officials, that they would lose their jobs if they were not loyal or acted upon by the General Police Administration was unfounded. ""No one is going to lose their job, fact. Even so far, anyone who has proven to be more effective in another job has been assured in human resources management that these people have been promoted or taken over by others. tasks, ""Olaj assured that"" these people will more or less continue their work "".
Olaj also responded to allegations that the role of the National Investigation Office (NPU) had been reduced. The chairman of the commission, Rudi Medved (LMŠ), was interested in whether this was his idea or whether it was a political dictum. Namely, there is no tender and mandate for the management of the NPU, Petra Grah Lazar took over the management of the office, who was also accused of lack of references. From investigating the most serious forms of economic crime, however, the NPU moved on to investigating whether the protests affected the spread of infections. ""The NPU maintains its autonomy, as before. They work well, they work well with the prosecution, the academic breadth of Lazar's Pea is known,"" says Olaj, who is convinced that we need managers in such places.
He also had to defend himself against accusations about staffing at the Police, for example in Kamnik and Maribor: ""Every staffing decision was in accordance with the regulations,"" Olaj insists.
Action against t. i. yellow jacket
They also touched on the protests on June 25, where the Police removed t. i. yellow jackets. Olaj confirmed that it is true that he initially praised the police officers for doing a tremendous job that day and managing the security risk around the central state celebration. The next day, a written report on the events and reactions of the public on social networks arrived, so he asked for additional explanations. He wondered why they were not the same wats for all involved, why one group was removed from the monument and the other was not. He asserted that he had not received any instructions from Interior Minister Aleš Hojs or any other police official.
According to Olaj, the now transferred director of the Ljubljana Police Department, Boštjan Glavič, and Nermin Isić, who was in charge of guarding the undeclared rally at the operational headquarters at the time, received it because of violations of the employment contract, not because they took action against t. i. yellow jackets, but because they did not act equally against others who were also violating order and peace at the time. Olaja was also annoyed that many police officers at that rally did not have their cameras on.
Police conduct on protests
Recently, the National Assembly expanded the time frame of the investigation, especially in light of the increased police repression in recent months, the chairman of the commission said at the time. Questions about this also flew to Olaja today. Medved's words referred in particular to the use of coercive means by the Police against the protesters. Most of the public's attention was probably drawn to the events at the protest on October 5, when the police also used a water cannon and tear gas.
""The boys did a great job that day,"" Olaj told the commission. An investigation is still underway into why the gas charges, for example, also flew to the empty square and Tivoli Park.
He said they considered all the situations, ""even what was good, and also what was not good enough"". He said it is now their job to the GPU to make certain changes - in the context of education or other measures or procedures to prevent similar situations from happening again, or at least in reduced numbers.
""When the matter starts to 'take action', then there can also be shortcomings. There are direct contacts between protesters and police officers, stones are thrown at police officers, they are injured,"" he described. ""The boys did a great job that day,"" Olaj told the commission, saying all police officers were working hard to contain the protest and restore public order. An investigation is underway into why gas bullets, for example, were flying through empty squares in the center of Ljubljana and Tivoli Park, where police officers were not directly attacked and a cloud of tear gas covered passers-by.
""The police had to react in stress, he has a helmet with a visor on his head, it's probably foggy, he had to choose the right charge. The right charges are separated from each other by a line, two or three, I don't know exactly. It could be a mistake , took the wrong charge that flew too far, ""replies Olaj, who believes that different charges should be intensely colored with some fluorescent color in order to be visible from afar.
According to the findings of the inspection carried out by five members of the parliamentary commission for the control of intelligence and security services (Knovs), Interior Minister Aleš Hojs, his state secretary Franc Kangler, state secretary for national security in two police operations centers during the protest to the Prime Minister's Office Žan Mahnič and the Director General of the Police Anton Olaj. A five-member expert commission, appointed by Olaj after the rally, found that the police used coercive means professionally and legally.
Sukic: Signs of abuse of office
Allegations of political influence were also raised when Mahnič called for the punishment of members of police unions. There was also talk about the handling of warnings before the dismissal of two trade unionists, Kristjan Mlekuš and Rok Cvetko. ""The warning is legally prescribed and legally permissible. The measure was applied in accordance with the regulations and is not necessary here, because the head of the work collective acts in accordance with the Employment Relations Act,"" Olaj claimed. ""There is jurisprudence about this. We are not plowing the field in this area. You are wrong, the instrument used was legal and legally permissible. It is a matter of law, nothing has been done wrong,"" Olaj said, urging unionists. to collaborate: ""I myself have no goal of throwing anyone out of work because there are too few of us.""
Left MP Nataša Sukič assessed that these were signs of abuse of official position. She is convinced that she should not use labor law proceedings against the union president, but could only use criminal or misdemeanor law. According to her, he fulfilled the elements of the crime under the second paragraph of Article 200 of the Criminal Code, which in her accusation to Olaj is ""what you have afforded"". And as she said, she therefore suggested to the chairman of the commission that the director general of the police be notified to the special department of the Specialized State Prosecutor's Office (SDT): she said at the meeting.
Bobnar is convinced that the Police should not be an extended policy deadline
Bobnar was appointed the first woman to head the police by the government of Marjan Šarc in December 2018, and was replaced by the government of Janez Janša at its inaugural session in March 2020. The former director general it is not and will not be an extended term of the policy "", she is today officially employed in the leadership of the Police, otherwise she is supposed to be part of the staff that was"" withdrawn ""to Tacen.
Bobnar, who has been employed by the Police for almost 30 years, emphasized at the beginning that she had no intention of slandering or causing damage to the system. She is saddened when she reads the comments that she is trying to take over the police: ""If politics knocks on the door of the Director General of Police, then it must stay there, otherwise it loses transparency and trust of the people,"" she said. procedures were not affected.
She is also convinced that the police should help and advise people during the epidemic. Therefore, she pointed out the questionability of the principle of proportionality regarding the fenced Republic Square in the way it was fenced off last summer, and the punishment for ""burek, croissants, Maribor students"".
He thinks that mandates in the Police can be a good solution, but he warned that there were no pre-determined criteria according to which the leadership will be elected. He believes that psychologists should also be an integral part of this process.
She said that she never questioned her dismissal in March last year, as it was the government's responsibility. According to her, she and her successor Anton Travner carried out the transfer, but she then moved to another office opposite. ""In June, he said that the Ministry of the Interior did not want my physical presence on Litostrojska, so I had to retreat to the corner, to the other part of the hallway, so that they did not see opinions in the office when they came to visit him. he interpreted it, ""she described. According to her, he said that before coming to this position ""on Gregorčičeva"" he was given two conditions - the replacement of the director of the Criminal Police Administration (UKP) and the National Investigation Office (NPU).
She estimates that she has been discredited and harassed for the last year and a half. ""All this obviously started after the supervision of the KNOVS commission in February at the General Police Administration, where this commission asked us for a list of those who were supposed to inspect the personal data of politicians and certain cases where covert investigative measures were not carried out. we did not provide that information, ”she said, claiming they acted in accordance with the law.
According to her, Mahnič told her during the inspection that ""if I don't give him information, let me think about my future"", which she understood as a threat, so she filed a report. In May, she received the completion of her application from the Ljubljana District State Prosecutor's Office at home, which is not classified, so she also read its contents to the members of the commission. They then decided to obtain a prosecutor's order themselves.
The sixth regular session of the Commission of Inquiry has been adjourned, and a resumption date has not yet been set.
Bear: Olaj se spreneveda
After the session, the chairman of the commission, Rudi Medved, made a statement. As he said, it turned out that the leadership of the Police wants to create the impression in every way that the situation within the system itself is ideal. Today, the Director General of the Police, Olaj, referred to the results of climate measurement in the Slovenian Police, but in the same breath he ignored everything that the unions say about the situation within the system, Medved emphasized.
He reminded that almost 8,000 police employees are involved in the two police unions, and the presidents have a different opinion on the situation in the Police than Olaj tried to present, he added. ""And when he tells the president that the situation is apathetic, that there has never been such a bad situation, Olaj gives them a warning, a warning before the termination of employment. Today he explained that it happened because they are defamatory,"" said Medved.
He added that the director of the police went even further when he explained how he did not remove or dismiss anyone during his term. ""Of course not, because people are leaving on their own. An eloquent example is the departure of the director of the Ljubljana Police Department. But Olaj says that everything is fine.""
According to Medved, Olaj also does not know what the former police chiefs, who were replaced by the current government, are doing. These people, as Bear said, feel degraded and offended because they can’t do their job. Olaj, however, says they are thrilled, Medved commented. ""In Tacen, there are special rooms ra thinking of former police chiefs who were not liked by the ruling politicians.""
According to him, the example of the protest in the Republic Square, where protesters set fire to cardboard chairs, shows that the director general of the police is not autonomous despite his claims at work. According to Medved, Olaj allegedly checked with the former director of the Ljubljana Police Department why they did not use a water cannon, although he himself knew in which extreme cases the police could use a water cannon, and the use must be approved by the director general. ""And, of course, it is quite clear that he got such a question from someone from politics and passed it on,"" Medved is convinced.
According to Medved, the work of the Police in the protests also shows that the leadership of the Slovene Police is acting in accordance with ""the Slovene ruling policy under the leadership of the SDS party"". According to Medved, today's testimony of Bobnar also exposed the former director general of the police, Anton Travner. According to Bobnar, he told her that he would be able to take the position of director general of the police, provided he immediately replaces former head of the National Investigation Office Darko Muženič and former head of the criminal police Boštjan Lindav, which Travner denied at the commission hearing."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/imamo-policijskega-ministra-in-policiste-ki-postajajo-vojaki.html,'We have a police minister and police officers becoming soldiers',"""Years and years of working with people have gone to waste. We are just another punishing body. Police officers are no longer decision-makers, but only executors who no longer have the opportunity to think for themselves. What they have learned in their careers, It doesn't mean anything anymore. They're becoming soldiers. "" This is how a retired police officer, who stood on the front line for many years in front of the protesters, thinks about the current situation. His experience and words put today's testimony of the Director General of the Police in a completely different light.","If anyone knows how the preparation and implementation of police protection of rallies and protests takes place, it is Vlado Ščavničar. Throughout his 35-year career in the Police, he was, as he puts it, a ""generalist"", an assistant commander at the Ljubljana Center Police Station, behind Bežigrad and Vič, and a commander in Grosuplje. Today, for the third year in a row, he is following with great disapproval what his colleagues are experiencing. We talked to him about the current situation in the Police, tensions on the streets and violent riots, about mistakes and possible solutions, and about the consequences of all this.
For seven years, between 2002 and 2009, you were the assistant commander of the PP Ljubljana Center, you have a lot of experience in guarding rallies and protests. How was it then compared to today?
It is true that during this period there was practically no major event or rally on Trdinova where he would not be present as the head of security in the field. There were student rallies, rallies against US policy in the Middle East or in the Arab world - Kuwait, Iraq, Iran. The unions protested, homosexuals, the erased… It seems to me that the protesters at the time had clearer goals of what they wanted to achieve. Today, however, they do not have a single idea. Some would not get vaccinated, others would not wear masks, others do not agree with Janša, others do not agree with government policy, others do not agree with anything ... They are protesting just to protest.
Was the situation ever so tense that you had to use a tear gas cannon or even a water cannon at demonstrations?
Never. Protesters burned a flag in front of the U.S. embassy as an individual had ever jumped into a police officer, and there were no major clashes. The water cannon as a coercive measure was never used, nor do I remember ever using a tear gas can to break up crowds. We mostly focused on individuals who were provocateurs. We eliminated them from the crowd and it calmed down.
Police never reveal their tactics regarding guarding rallies. Can you at least give us a rough idea of ​​how the preparations for this are going?
They already differ depending on whether the rally is registered or not. The assembly is a constitutional right of the people, the Police cannot prevent it in advance, except when it is clear from the report itself that it is aimed at demolishing the order, violating public order and committing a crime. It is then proposed to the administrative unit to ban it. If he is registered, things are agreed upon upon registration - we know who will take care of the course, content, security and. If the rally is not registered, information is collected beforehand, which includes monitoring social networks, getting to know the organizers and gathering information about what they have done in the past. Because the real organizers are usually well hidden because they do not want to take responsibility for the situation that will arise, or they are afraid that they will lose their status.
Based on the information gathered, it is then estimated how many people and what resources will be needed for protection. The most commonly used means are fences. You are counting on uniformed police officers and police officers of the special unit to be able to control the situation with orders and physical force, and in any case, if things escalate, other means must also be counted on. I see other means that are milder here than water cannon and tear gas, for example on cavalry - with it you can intimidate, push, break up the crowd. There is much more that could be done with a special police unit. But the question here is what politics wants to achieve. The fact is that we have a police minister and not an interior minister. A Minister who goes directly into the debate on how the Police should manage their tactics and methodology. He comments, demands and commands, which is inadmissible for me.
Well, while we're at it. In ""your time"", did it ever happen that a minister came to the operational headquarters in the middle of the action - during the protest?
I've never seen or heard of anything like this. Yes, the Director General, the Director of the Police Administration, the Uniformed Police Administration, any Police Officer. Or that they showed the headquarters to someone during a visit to an individual police administration. Not that some official would go or. politicians to the headquarters directly at the rally to watch on screen what is happening on the ground.
What exactly is going on at headquarters then?
All information from the field at the event comes to the headquarters. From here the information is sent to the field and from here it is ordered what to do. The decision-makers give instructions on what tactics will be chosen to protect, how many means will be used and which ones.
So if a person in position comes to the headquarters and comments on the situation - could this be understood as an instruction on how to act?
Absolutely. They are not called ""just one"" to the headquarters. There, decisions are made by a person who has experience and has progressed to this position. This is not a man who came from politics, he usually has a police career behind him. However, if someone in the position comes to the headquarters, this - even if this person insists on his / her expertise - will certainly influence his / her decision somewhere behind. You can’t be insensitive to the opinion of someone coming from the top. This service is hierarchically organized, sooner or later you get by the hump because you didn’t take something into account.
How do you view the protests that we have been following for so long and the reaction of the police on October 5, when Ljubljana was bathed in tears?
The protesters are gathered from all winds and have completely different ideas. There is no single idea of ​​what they want to achieve at all, so it’s not hard to seduce them left, right, up, down ... take advantage of them. You put a few returnees in and things go quickly where someone wants to go. Who, however, is the question. Is it politics, individuals, criminal clientele… I doubt that people who appear in the media as organizers organize rallies because they want violence to take place there. They are both very smart, and if someone is a culturist, he knows very well that the word lurks more than force. I think they took advantage of them. Too bad they didn't anticipate it.
The response of the police officers, however, is questionable. The moment something happens, you have to make a quick decision. If you have an order or intention in advance that something is not allowed, that something does not want to be heard or seen, that the Police must prevent it… this may be contrary to the tactics, methodology and general way of working of the Police. I think my colleague Mikulan, who introduced community policing in the early 1990s, is crucified today because nothing is focused on what will happen next. The police are losing reputation, respect, professionalism. It is true that on such occasions, some police officers experience their frustrations because they know that their behavior will not treat them as they would otherwise. Most police officers, however, work in accordance with the profession and legally. But if they get an order, they carry it out. Action against the crowd is coordinated and commanded from the top down. I do not know whether the use of such coercive means was necessary at this protest or not because I was not there. Judging by what I saw in the media and on social media, it could have been different.
How would you act in such a case?
I have a feeling that the Police are not working with the organizers. Even if the rally is not registered, we need to get in touch with the people we have identified as organizers and listen to them, give them the opportunity to have their say, even if they are against the Police. Many things can be directed earlier. Make a deal, then keep that man's word. If things escalate, the first thing is to individually exclude individuals, provocateurs from the crowd. People have the right to protest, but they have no right to break. And the crowd did not go there to break up, but to tell and tell. It is true, however, that not all of these rallies would have taken place if anyone had heard her.
Without a water cannon and firing a tear gas can certainly go. Even if there are 10,000 people at the rally, not everyone is on alert at that moment. There are individuals who can be eliminated by the tactics of the PPE, if that doesn't work, there is still cavalry here ... Water cannon and tear gas are extreme coercive means that would be used to burn garbage cans, rob stores, beat people. .. but that was not here. But once the rally is disbanded, when people are ordered to disperse, they must do so. If they don’t, you’re not asking them, you’re taking action. You break up the crowd. You remove those who call for perseverance. The others will go sooner or later.
The commission found that members of the special police tear gas unit had wrongly chosen long-range ammunition. Can such a mistake happen?
No. It can’t happen that officers performing tasks are given different rounds of ammunition or missiles to charge. We’re not Alec Baldwin getting a shot in the gun. We have weapons experts. Everything that was used was given. It is possible, however, that the wrong order was issued.
What do your former colleagues with whom you are still in contact tell you about the current situation?
The police officers I am in contact with are not directly involved in the situation, but they know the situation. They say they are no longer decision makers, but only executors. The organization of this service is hierarchical, there was always someone above you who could command you something, but within some framework. Now, however, everything you’ve learned in your career - from schooling to field work, knowledge and experience - means nothing more. As an expert in a field, I no longer have the opportunity to think for myself. It all leads to police officers becoming soldiers, but there is a significant difference between these two uniformed services. The soldier is the direct executor of the order, and the police officer must know things, legislation, tactics and methodology and work accordingly. When you go to the crowd, you act according to the order or according to a pre-agreed plan, but still the police officer must be the one who will be the last filter before doing something. This is action against the crowd, against your people!
So they found themselves in an ungrateful position. Protesters somehow expect to join them, urging them to drop their helmets and side with them. But even closer to that was the thumb of a police officer on a motorcycle, who was photographed with one of the protesters last year. Why don't they do that?
We saw what the consequences of this act were, only the raised thumb had such an echo. The boys are afraid for their jobs, for their integrity. They all have families. They will also find it difficult to join a crowd that does not have clear views on what it wants to achieve. If these views were clear, if some values ​​of this society were to be defended, I am sure the police officers would have decided otherwise. Also the management staff - at least the middle management, which is most affected. Certain political beliefs in the Police have changed, but values ​​have remained common to all. In doing so, police officers need to be won over to their side - by values, not by political views.
So the damage has been done, you said yourself - the reputation that the Police have been building for a long time has fallen sharply. When, if at all, will she be able to get it back?
Very difficult. The police jumped on the scale of trust in the war of independence or in the proceedings before that. It is not the police or the decision-makers who are to blame for the decline, but the very top of the Police and the policy it pursues. Something is likely to change with the election. Let's hope so. But this will not bring prestige, respect, the boys will have problems at work because of it. Years and years of working with people have gone to nothing. We are just another body that punishes. The police will only secure their reputation when they make a cut at the systemic level and exclude the director general from the possibility of any replacements. And when it can be an expert, no matter what the daily policy. It does not have to be compatible with politics. Politics should be compatible with the values ​​of this society.
What do you think about the latest proposal of the Minister of the Interior that the costs of protecting the rallies should be paid by the organizers?
Yeah, this one is beautiful. If you want to further restrict freedom of expression, the right to assembly, other freedoms and rights, ultimately restrict democracy and introduce one-mindedness, you are proposing that all costs be borne by the organizer. Payment for security is already in force, but only for events, obviously the Minister would like to make it more difficult or even impossible to gather people or. public gatherings. This “specimen” whistles at the Constitution and international acts on rights and freedoms."

The interrogation of Klemen Nicoletti, director of the company Majbert Pharm, was also announced, but he did not attend the meeting. Viktorija Tomič, head of the expert group for rapid tests at the Ministry of Health, said at the hearing that the tests supplied by the company did not meet the professional criteria for use for screening purposes.","The commission was scheduled to hear five witnesses today. The most interesting should be the last one, when the director and co-owner of the company Majbert Pharm Klemen Nicoletti testified. He did not attend this hearing in the end. According to Pavšič, he was served with an invitation to the hearing.
Miroslav Petrovec, head of the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology and head of the laboratory for the diagnosis of viral infections, was the first to be questioned today. He was also a member of an expert group that proposed measures to the government.
Regarding the evaluation of rapid tests, he said that his role in the group was less important and that a lot of important work in the group was done by Viktorija Tomič, who, according to him, tried to help with all the knowledge that if rapid tests are already used, the best. Sam expressed a lot of doubts about antigen tests because, according to him, they have a slightly low sensitivity and should not be decisive for the diagnosis.
With the outbreak of the epidemic, however, a huge number of offers for antigen tests came to the table, he said. At IMI, the validation of rapid tests was rejected, and Petrovec cited overcrowding and the fact that the evaluation of antigen tests is a problem because another swab needs to be taken to compare with the PCR method, which would require the opinion of the ethics committee.
Petrovec, who fully trusts the professionalism of NLZOH employees, asked Pavšič how he commented that NLZOH, which is not intended for test validation, took only one manufacturer and only one test for validation and found that it was suitable for further use. to others he replied that the NLZOH was, by function, the one to whom the Minister turned. To me, however, hypothetically, as he said, they have enough knowledge to be able to assess this properly.
In his testimony, he pointed out the problem of the rapid spread of swabs for infection with a new coronavirus from the nasal part of the throat, as few people were trained to take swabs. thus increasing the possibility of errors. He also said that Slovenia is among the countries where the most tests are performed, which is ""commendable, but we must always ask ourselves whether we really had an impact on the epidemic.""
Tomič: Majbert Pharm's rapid tests did not meet the professional criteria
Viktorija Tomič, head of the expert group for rapid tests, was the second witness. She said Majbert Pharm's rapid tests did not meet the tender conditions, nor did the professional requirements. She explained in the introduction that the group was appointed by the Ministry of Health towards the end of last year, before the start of the use of rapid antigen tests. The task of the four-member group was to prepare expert recommendations for their use.
According to her, the group determined the lowest appropriate level of sensitivity of rapid tests. Manufacturers had to state at least 95% sensitivity of the tests in the documentation, and analysis in the laboratory had to show at least 90% sensitivity. 90% sensitivity is also recommended by the European Center for Infectious Diseases (ECDC).
The World Health Organization (WHO), however, recommends a lower, 80 percent sensitivity test, she said. “These recommendations are a bit more lenient because they have to make sure that even in poorer countries where they don’t have logistics (...), testing can run,” she explained the decision of the group, which opted for higher required sensitivity.
Verification of Majbert Pharma rapid tests was performed by the National Laboratory for Health, Environment and Food (NLZOH). These are tests purchased by the Ministry of Health in December 2020 for the purpose of general screening of the population. Tomič estimated that the NLZOH did not answer the questions they asked during the verification. Thus, they constantly pointed out that the tests of the mentioned company meet the WHO criteria and the manufacturer's statements, but only in the part when they were analyzed in the detection of infection among sick people.
She recalled that the NLZOH had found that tests to detect asymptomatic infections were not sufficient to meet the guidelines of the WHO, the ECDC and the expert group. To her knowledge, rapid tests were intended for general screening use in Slovenia, but PCR tests are still used to diagnose the disease.
The chairman of the commission, Robert Pavšič, pointed out that the NLZOH had only validated the Majbert Pharm rapid tests and that the director of the NLZOH, Tjaša Žohar Čretnik, had said at a previous commission meeting that she had made such a decision herself. Tomič emphasized that it was difficult to comment on the decision, but that, according to her expert assessment, the analysis of only one test was not appropriate. When asked by Mojca Škrinjar (SDS), she explained that a potential analysis of the suitability of several tests would take place at the same time and would not be more time-consuming.
At the end, she expressed regret, as according to her assurances, the Slovenian microbiological profession would be able to introduce rapid tests as needed. She pointed out that microbiologists first prepare thoroughly in their work and only then make decisions, and not the other way around. If she relied more on the profession to lead the covida-19 epidemic, she said, it would be easier to prepare people for trust. “But now even the professions people don’t believe anymore,” she recalled.
Former and current CEO of Fursa was also questioned
Among the witnesses were Ivan Simič, director of the Financial Administration, who was a member of Lahovnik's advisory group at the time of the epidemic, which wrote anti-crown measures to alleviate the consequences of the epidemic, and Peter Jenko, former director of Furs.
Simic denied that politics would interfere in his work. In a heated debate, he repeatedly reproached the chairman of the commission, Pavšič, that the questions were not related to the content of the commission's work. Before being appointed head of the Financial Administration of the Republic of Slovenia (Furs), Pavšič, who was, among others, chairman of the government's strategic council for debureaucratization and a member of the group for preparing anti-crown packages, asked questions about his visits to financial offices. a member of the Strategic Council, on staffing at Furs in recent times, as well as the operation of two tax advisory companies that are owned by him but are not currently run by Furs.
Simič repeatedly accused Pavšič of asking him the same questions as he received from the necenzurirano.si portal. .
Simič estimated that Pavšič asked him about the customers without good reason and that they had nothing to do with the subject and competence of the commission of inquiry, except for Geneplanet, which is known as a supplier of fans in connection with the epidemic. ""We represent everyone, left and right, we work legally,"" Simic said, confirming that they also represented Geneplanet.
Pavšič said that he wanted to establish ""a general picture of what is happening on Furs in Slovenia after the declaration of the epidemic"". He said that everything he asked was also the subject of the investigation, as the explanation of the act ordering the investigation also ""accused clientelism and nepotism"".
Simic, who repeatedly pointed out his achievements and experience in the field of taxes in Slovenia and abroad, said that he was not a member of any political party and that the position of director general of Furs was certainly his last, as he had been for years. Regarding the impact of government measures in the epidemic and the operation of Furs, he estimated that these are reflected in record public revenues. According to him, in the first 11 months of this year, 2.5 billion euros more was collected than last year, and 1.3 billion euros more than the year before. Unemployment is also at a record low in Slovenia, ""companies are doing fantastic and this means that all measures are working"", he said.
He also said that whenever he was the director of Furs, he took the best income taxpayer out of respect every year for lunch because he paid so much income tax. Regarding these allegations, Pavšič warned him that this was a tax secret. Former Fursa director Peter Jenko, who was relieved of his post at the end of August 2020, was also questioned before the commission. . As Jenko found out, however, some of Furs ’actions were more correct during his tenure, while others were less correct.
According to him, these are procedures related to the field of intervention legislation during the epidemic, where Furs participated in deferrals of payment, payment of monthly basic income for the self-employed, as well as in the preparation and implementation of tourist vouchers. Jenko explained that he is no longer employed at Furs. When asked about the change in the way of working after his dismissal, he emphasized that each general director has his own way of leading, and it is difficult to comment on the events in the period after his departure."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/pred-nami-so-dobri-casi.html,‘Don’t indulge in illusions. The challenges we face are great ',"It is done, today say the voices of relief in Germany. A good ten weeks after the federal elections, the ""traffic light"" parties - SPD, Greens and FDP - have just signed a negotiated coalition agreement. So there is no longer an obstacle to the oath of the new government, which will succeed Angela Merkel after 16 years.","The first man of the new government, Olaf Scholz, Christian Lindner and Robert Habeck, on behalf of the coalition partners, proudly showed the cameras the signed contracts.
Today is a day of broad political smiles in Germany, and then there will be a time of work for the Alliance of Social Democrats, Liberals and Greens, in which they will have to prove that the announced break with Merkel's rule and the move to a new, greener, moral and just direction is not just a promise. , but a viable vision.
""If our government's work goes as well as our cooperation in recent weeks, we have good times ahead of us. We must face a difficult task at the outset: the fight against the Crown Crisis. We will focus all our efforts on this,"" Scholz said today.
He was not the only one to be overwhelmed by optimism today. Annalena Baerbock of the Greens, who competed for Scholz's position as chancellor during the campaign, said they are at the pinnacle of social reality and it is now their job to bring the coalition agreement to life. ""From today, we will be a government for the people of Germany,"" added her party colleague Habeck.
""We have spoken to each other for a long time and clearly and we have also spoken intensively to the public. Now is the time to act. Don't indulge in illusions. The challenges we face are great,"" Liberal leader Lindner added.
According to the coalition agreement, Germany has an offensive climate policy, a moral foreign policy and a welcome policy in the field of migration.
The SPD will have a chancellor and six ministries in the new government, which will have eight ministers each, including interior, health, defense and labor and social affairs. The Greens will lead five - Baerbock will be foreign minister, Habeck will take over the Ministry of Economy and Climate Policy. Liberals will lead four ministries, Lindner will be finance minister.
It is interesting how the voters interpret the outcome of the coalition negotiations. Although the Greens are in the hands of the Foreign and Economic and Climate Ministries, ie areas where the Greens want concrete changes, polls show that the public does not have the impression that the Greens are the winners of the negotiations.
The winners are supposed to be liberals, and the greens are losers, says the result of a survey by the YouGov opinion institute, reports focus.de. 27 percent of respondents thought that the FDP had managed to defend most of its own ideas in the negotiations, with 20 percent saying so for the SPD and only 12 percent for the Greens. 17 percent believe that all three parties have equally asserted their interests.
And what do more than 2,000 respondents expect from the new government and the 177-party coalition agreement entitled Hope to Make More Progress? Climate protection comes first, followed by social and health action, as well as housing affordability."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/bodo-stroske-policijskega-varovanja-protestov-morali-poravnati-organizatorji.html,Will the costs of police protection of the protests have to be paid by the organizers?,"Minister Hojs took the initiative to the State Attorney's Office to extort money from informal protest organizers. The law firm is still studying the initiative. However, the Legal Network for the Protection of Democracy is convinced that there is no legal basis for recovery and that politics only wants to intimidate protesters, thus severely encroaching on the right to public assembly and freedom of expression.","85 Friday protests, with many in between. The common denominator of all was enhanced police protection and high police costs. ""These costs are quite significant - if you add up all these weeks, this damage goes to a million or two,"" explains Interior Minister Aleš Hojs. And the cost of operating the Police, including the cost of repairing damaged police equipment, Hojs would now impose on protest organizers.
""We believe that there is no legal basis on which the state could demand from the protesters to reimburse the costs of protection,"" said Anuška Podvršič from the Legal Network for the Protection of Democracy. There, they are convinced that most of the protests since March last year have not been organized, but spontaneous. The law clearly separates the organizers and initiators of the protests. ""I think that the entire Slovenian public is aware of who the organizers are,"" explains Hojs. However, they obviously have some more concerns about this issue at the State Attorney's Office, where the possibility of lawsuits is still being studied.
According to unofficial information from Dnevnik, the question of the organizers is said to be stuck. The name of Jaša Jenulla is said to have appeared most often in the first requests of the Ministry of the Interior. ""This is another obvious example of how the government is disregarding the constitution and trying to inappropriately influence the prevention of protests,"" Jenull said.
Some invoices for the costs of the protests have been sent to Jenull in the past. ""They tried to charge me for renting the fences, which of course I didn't order or want there,"" he explains. ""Obviously, this is intimidation, which does not belong in a state governed by the rule of law,"" Podvršič commented.
Minister Hojs, however, replies: ""I think it is clear that things are not free."" Protesters insist that a healthy democracy is invaluable and that protests are part of it. Despite the possibility of lawsuits, they do not intend to suspend their rallies."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/tujina/nemcija_2.html,A break. And a ‘radically autonomous’ man,"Germany is on the verge of leaving Angela Merkel in charge of Olaf Scholz after 16 years. While Merkel as a ""crisis chancellor"" has reacted more than paved new paths, the ""traffic light"" of Social Democrats, Greens and Liberals is supposed to work quite differently - Scholz sees himself in the role of ""climate chancellor"" and the new coalition heralds big, visionary steps.","The new coalition promises a ""major breakthrough"" in ecology and, consequently, in the economy, foreign and social policy. While many applaud the plan, others feel it is all too much.
Either way, progress policy should now replace crisis response. Supporters of the traffic light are talking about reforms and modernization, and critics are worried that Germany is entering a period of activism, specifically climate activism, with too much emotion at the forefront and too little reality.
It is true, however, that Scholz never hid his ambitions for major changes. He spoke about the biggest restructuring of the industry after the first industrialization, ie after more than 150 years. Winning the election, however, means that he has a mandate to implement this idea and coalition partners who want change even more than he does.
Tectonic shift is expected to occur in the economy. While conservative politics has left him a lot of freedom, now this great transformation is supposed to be orchestrated by politics. The coalition agreement is clear: 80 percent of renewable energy by 2030.
This, in turn, means that the lives of Germans will change, and not just by having more windmills. ""We will work differently, drive differently and eat differently,"" Ulrich Reitz summed up the situation in an analysis for the German Focus.
Far-reaching changes are forecasted in foreign policy, especially in two areas, he said: ""Commitment to the goal of Europe becoming a federal state would change the statehood of the federal republic. This may sound technocratic or too academic, but it can have consequences for our emotional capital: what is our patriotism for (if it still exists), what should we be proud of in the future when Germany fades? "" The issue of national identity is of particular concern to Germans, who already in Merkel's time thought that too little attention was being paid to this. But with the new government come different social emphases.
The second area touches on the moral dimension of foreign policy. Merkel's policy took into account the fact that the Chinese are now Germany's most important trading partner, and therefore treated Beijing more in the glovebox, which meant that (except for occasional polite words) the fate of Hong Kong, Tibetans, Uighurs and Taiwanese played almost no part in foreign policy. applications, but now it is supposed to be different.
Most, however, doubt the veracity of these predictions. When it comes to deciding between money and morality, history teaches that the latter has little choice. Therefore, the big question remains whether the Germans will be even more in favor of the changes when they find out how they affect the situation in their wallets.
The third turning point, however, concerns society. The traffic light wants more immigration for the labor market, more immigration through refugee policy and a faster path to citizenship.
The only area in which Germany remains quite conservative is social policy. Those who are already subsidized by the state will continue to receive more - minimum wage recipients, social assistance recipients and pensioners. None of these three large groups need to fear major change.
So if we draw the line under the German coalition negotiations: an offensive climate policy, a moral foreign policy and a welcome policy in the field of migration are promising. And although Scholz will be chancellor, the Greens and (partly) liberals have made the most of it.
But let's take a closer look at some of the high-profile areas of the coalition agreement that relate to social change. Highlights were extracted at zeit.de.
Raft
Abortion should be more easily accessible, limiting the activities of abortion opponents. In addition, they want to completely lift the advertising ban. So far, doctors have only been able to provide very limited information about offering abortion. Religious communities oppose the idea.
Rainbow families
Couples without children are expected to receive more support in the future. This means that artificial insemination would be financially supported, and not just for heterosexual couples. Rainbow families with same-sex parents are important to the new government. In the future, pre-implant diagnostics, which could be used to determine whether an artificially created fetus has a hereditary disease or an anomaly in the genome, could be paid for in full by the state. It should also be possible to select the embryo with the best chances of survival after in vitro fertilization, they believe. In general, reproductive policy is becoming significantly more liberal: it is also necessary to examine whether egg donation and surrogacy can be legalized.
Gender
The coalition wants to reduce the pay gap between men and women and strengthen women's rights in general. In addition, research on contraceptives for all sexes should be better funded. The new government wants to strengthen the rights of queer people. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender and intersex people should participate equally in politics and the economy. To achieve these goals, the new government wants to draw up a ""gender action plan"", but has not yet clarified the details. In the field of gender, they are in favor of self-determination, and the costs of gender reassignment surgery must be fully covered by compulsory health insurance companies.
Relation to faith
Overall, the new coalition agreement is much more secular than its predecessor due to the departure of Christian parties from government. This is particularly clear in the area of ​​reproduction and gender, and continues in the coalition's conception of man, already described by German church circles as ""radically autonomous."" The coalition agreement does not specify euthanasia.
Migrations
Anyone who has integrated well at a young age (up to 27) should have the right to stay in Germany after three years, including those who have been victims of trafficking. When a refugee arrives in Germany, he should be able to take part in integration courses. The difficult legal situation needs to be simplified. But the traffic light also says: Not everyone who comes can stay. Criminals must be deported quickly.
Environment
All three parties are more or less strongly committed to climate protection. The Alliance for Freedom, Justice and Sustainability Treaty requires that the Paris climate targets be given the ""highest priority"", that the phasing out of coal ""ideally"" be achieved in 2030, not just 2038, and that the protection program adopted next year."
https://www.24ur.com/sport/ostalo/zveza-itf-noce-kaznovati-vseh-kitajcev-zaradi-peng-shuai.html,The ITF does not want to punish all Chinese for Peng Shuai,"ITF President David Haggerty said his organization would not follow the example of the WTA Tennis Association and join the boycott of China over the Peng Shuai case because it ""does not want to punish billions of people."" The WTA suspended all tournaments in China last week for the safety of the player.","The WTA Tennis Association has canceled all tournaments that China should host next year, including those in Hong Kong, due to the unresponsiveness of the Chinese authorities in the case of Peng Shuai, WTA President Steve Simon said. Thirty-five-year-old Peng, a former world number one in doubles and a two-time grand slam tournament winner, accused the former high-ranking Chinese politician of sexual assault in early November. Since then, the association has repeatedly expressed deep concern over the fate of the tennis player, who has disappeared from public life. ""How should I explain to our actresses that they play where Peng Shuai is not allowed to communicate freely with the public and obviously restrains her against her will by various methods? Of course, I also fear for the safety of our actresses who should perform in China in 2022 , ""President Simon wrote last week. He added that the move - which could cost the WTA hundreds of millions of dollars - had the full support of WTA directors. Meanwhile, the ATP Players' Association has not followed the WTA move and has now been rejected by the ITF, reports the French news agency AFP. ""As the umbrella tennis association, of course, we support women's rights. Peng's security allegations must be taken seriously and investigated. We will continue to work in the background and influence the resolution of the situation,"" said ITF President David Haggerty.
""But it should be noted that the ITF is an umbrella tennis organization worldwide, so one of our fundamental responsibilities is to develop the sport. That is why we do not want to punish billions of people with a possible boycott; we will continue to organize both membership and youth tournaments in China."" Haggerty added."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/aljosa-bagola-instagram-je-razkazovalnik-twitter-je-razjezilnik-facebook-pa-je-postal-razdvojevalnik.html,"'Instagram is a show-off, Twitter is a hotspot, and Facebook has become a splitter'","He is considered a prodigy of advertising, and Aljoša Bagola impressed Slovenians with his frankness in his book on burnout, so much so that his first book was sold out four times. How could he ban hate speech, why do young people risk their lives for the likes of their personal profiles, and last but not least, what helped him to deal with burnout in addition to professional help? Uroš Slak talked to him on the show Ena na Ena.","Have social networks, especially Twitter, become tools of politicians that divide the nation? Aljoša Bagola answers that they are. ""We live in a world of superstimulants. And one of those is flavor enhancers in food. But I tell social media they are focus enhancers. Instagram is a showpiece, Twitter is a razor, and Facebook has become a splitter. Algorithms perfectly emphasize a certain aspect of our emotions. as much of our attention as possible and that is why we are easy targets for political maneuvers, which are now easily succeeded with the help of social media, ”he explained.
He further said that among the politicians who use social networks to achieve their political goals, the best Prime Minister is Janez Janša. Why? Because he understands the psychology of the user, in that he basically uses the former rule of 'bread and games' in a way adapted to the modern world. And I call this 'noise and games'. , provocations, provocations. ""
We are witnessing a time when Donald Trump provided a free online course for many politicians for four years, Bagola outlined the involvement of politicians on social networks. ""Basically, when the American president sets some standard of communication culture, political moves, that then seems acceptable."" Because politicians even in the virtual world are fighting for attention. With vulgar and even banal moves, they create this noise, which is louder than the actual one, Bagola explained.
'We are not able to go deep inside and forgive another'
Twitter also seems to have become the only communication channel of some politicians with the public. This is usually made possible by press conferences, where journalists also have the opportunity to ask questions, and on Twitter this communication is one-sided. It has happened, Bagola said, that you can freely spread your message everywhere, ""without being subject to the key principle of democracy, that the media are the watchdogs of democracy"". And it also shook people's confidence in politics.
But why are politicians incapable of t. i. fair play or 'fair play'? Why are there still divisions in society if you are not with me, you are against me?
Bagola explains that our brains have learned a different view of the world over the past 20 years. Just like it is on Facebook, if you don’t get a thumbs up, the only opposite is just a thumbs down. We look at the world in black and white. He sees another problem in Slovenia in the post-war trauma, which is still unresolved. We are not able to go deep inside and forgive others, he says. That is why we pass on these traumas from generation to generation.
He adds that Slovenians, on the other hand, are creative and diligent, but we do not know how to reach a consensus, look inside ourselves and study what is good for the country. ""The common goal must be solid and there is none.""
'Communication could solve many things'
The host of the show, Uroš Slak, then described the case when a delegation of the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties recently visited Slovenia to check the level of democracy. The head of the delegation, Sophie in 't Veld, said that she had never seen such a bitter debate and that there was a lot of bitterness in our country. Why? Bagola replied that it is characteristic of Slovenes that we always put the expectations of others first, we always want it to turn out that everything is fine with us, but in reality we suppress everything that bothers us. And it pushes out when it’s least needed. He described this as the magnitude of the boiling, which bursts through all the pores of society, social media, the political scene. He suggests that a healthy psychological treatment of this problem is needed. That we know how to express our emotions and also accept them.
In doing so, he touched on hate speech, which he believes should be punished by those who spread it. ""Absolutely. It seems to me that postponing a foreign mistake today is a kind of filtering of one's anger. If I disagree with someone, then I catapult my anger, my anger, with offensive commentary, with hate speech. And that seems to me to be to be punished. It doesn't seem right to me that hate speech is spreading under anonymous nicknames. ""
This was on the rise in Slovenia at the time of the epidemic. Bagola notes that there was a lot of solidarity among the people during the first quarantine. We knew how to come together to leave these difficult times as winners. ""We were ready to help each other in need."" Then it became clear that the coronavirus would not just blow out. Discussions about vaccines have also begun and divisions have begun. There have been a number of gaps in society that we will find difficult to overcome, he said.
Government communication, which should be more humane, also contributed to this, Bagola notes. ""A lot of things could be solved through communication. To make people feel dignified, to not feel like they're being bitten off a finger, to be denied a life.""
The pitfalls of social networks
With the withdrawal from the epidemic, the two interlocutors returned to the traps of social networks. Young people often find themselves in this trap because of the need to belong, to be approved. But the collateral damage that results from this is very pronounced, Bagola notes. From self-harm, depression to suicide. The hardships are very severe, so he says we should have laws to protect us from social media. He also pointed out that young people like it are ready to go very far.
And hardships occur in all periods of human life. He himself went through a difficult ordeal. ""In my case, it was first realizing how weak I could have been that this had happened to me. It scared me the most. That I had let myself down, my family, my team at work. The sense of shame is further reinforced by guilt. It gnawed at me. ""I took a bite. Then I allowed myself to look at it differently. With the help of psychotherapy, I realized that I wasn't weak, but I was too strong for too long,"" he explains. He also looked at his family, who stood by his side throughout. I am proud of my wife Ivo Krajnc Bagola, he said. ""I admire her in the theater, I always clench my fists for her, she's a top actress.""
Burnout robs you of contentment, joy, happiness, to the last cell in the body. Anxiety and anxiety follow, and then you have to resocialize again, Bagola described the feelings.
It started out that after all the successes he was suddenly besieged, unable to get out of bed. He was exhausted. From his home bed, he browsed the World Wide Web to find out which of his role models had already had something similar happen to him. He noticed that Google was silent on the matter. ""Mental health is taboo in Slovenia, we are ashamed."" The only solution is to talk about it, he said. It was then that he swore that when he recovered enough, he would start writing about it. First there were the columns, then the books. Now there are also lectures in which he encourages people to talk about mental distress.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/pokojnine.html,In favor of the proposal for extraordinary harmonization of pensions in parliamentary groups,"The parliamentary groups are in favor of the proposal for a pension amendment, with which DeSUS deputies want to finally eliminate the consequences of austerity measures for pensioners and adjust their pensions in December in the amount of 3.5 percent. In some of them, more detailed positions will be defined, among other things, they are in favor of extraordinary harmonization in the absolute amount, which means that the pension of every pensioner would be increased by the same amount. There were also warnings of greater emphasis on the long-term stability of the pension fund.","During the financial and economic crisis, Slovenia introduced some austerity measures, which, among other things, also affected the amount of pensions. According to the SDS, the freeze on the adjustment of pensions to economic growth in recent years has affected the material situation of pensioners, which needs to be corrected, so they support the proposal in principle.
NSi is also in favor of raising pensions and eliminating injustices committed in pension legislation in the past.
The SMC has assured that it will strive for fair and financially sustainable solutions. They agree that there have been disparities and unequal treatment of pensioners who have retired at different times in the past. They therefore support the regulation of this issue.
The richest the most and the poorest the least?
""Of course, pensions should be increased and pensioners should be given a decent old age,"" the opposition LMŠ is convinced. They therefore do not oppose the extraordinary adjustment of pensions. However, they remind that responsible policy should do more for the long-term stability of the pension fund. It should, for example, ensure a breakthrough in development and increase added value, and enable young people to become independent as soon as possible.
The SD and NeP parliamentary groups are also in favor of the proposal.
At SAB, they advocate for all solutions that benefit retirees. According to their assurances, this will continue to be the case, regardless of the proposer.
In the Left, they say that they have always been advocating for the elimination of injustices that have been done to pensioners in the past. They support the DeSUS proposal, emphasizing that it does not solve all past injustices or injustices from the time of the current government. They have in mind the adjustment of pensions this year, which did not take into account actual wages in 2020. Thus, they believe that the regular adjustment, according to which pensions have increased by 2.5 percent since 1 January, was inadequate. In their view, the extraordinary harmonization should otherwise be in absolute terms. This means that the pension of each pensioner would be increased by the same amount, while according to the DeSUS proposal, the richest pensioners would receive the most and the poorest the least.
The leader of the SNS parliamentary group, Zmago Jelinčič Plemeniti, described the DeSUS proposal as an ""interesting matter"" that they support. However, because the procedural path is complicated, it is difficult to believe that it will be accepted.
Deprived again this year
Regarding the reimbursement of underpaid pensions in the period from 2010 to 2015 due to the economic crisis, the Pension and Disability Insurance Institute has repeatedly said that most of the extraordinary adjustments to pensions are already better than in the case of harmonization under the system law. The deficit from this period is only 3.5 percent for retirees up to and including 2010, and 1.7 percent for retirees in 2011. After adjusting pensions in January this year, they are at an additional percentage point.
The harmonization was 2.5 percent instead of 3.5 percent, as it should be according to the system law. The difference arose because the National Statistical Office did not take into account those who were paid by the state for the time spent waiting for work due to the covida-19 epidemic when calculating the growth of the average wage. If the benefits were paid by the employer, they would be taken into account. However, all allowances are taken into account, which was quite a lot in 2020. Retirees this year are also deprived of one percent for the same reason."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/odbor-za-izobrazevanje-o-predlogu-spremembe-sestave-svetov-vrtcev-in-sol.html,Controversial proposal for an amendment to the law: 'Proponents of intentions do not even hide after the politicization of the school',"The parliamentary committee for education, science, sports and youth discussed the proposed amendment to the law on the organization and financing of education, which envisages an increase in the number of representatives of the founder. The pedagogical profession opposes the proposal, as politics instead of employees is supposed to have more influence in the appointment of school and kindergarten principals. Unfortunately, the assessment of the situation in the proposal is a sticker of political platitudes and, in the context of torn assessments, the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana emphasizes:","The proposed amendment to the law, which was submitted to the legislative process by SDS, NSi, SMC and national deputies, is critical of the Trade Union of Education, Science and Culture of Slovenia (Sviz) and the profession. Increasing the number of representatives of the founder to five out of a total of 11 members, as many point out, opens the door to the decisive influence of politics on the operation of kindergartens and schools and the selection of principals.
Klara Skubic Ermenc, head of the Department of Pedagogy and Andragogy at the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana, said that the experts said that ""this is an exceptionally controversial proposal that will increase the politicization of schools and contribute to breaking their professionalism"". According to her, education must be professional, away from daily politics and open to all children and young people, regardless of the beliefs and financial situation of families. ""Those in charge are more interested in the way in which politicians at the national and local level would gain more influence in education than quality,"" said Skubic Ermenčeva.
Amendments to the law are also not supported in the Community of Kindergartens of Slovenia. President Janja Bogataj said that the amendment does not bring novelties that would encourage the operation of educational institutions. ""Some solutions could also indicate a political orientation,"" she warned. The community of kindergartens does not support changes in the composition of the councils of institutions, but they also oppose the article referring to the promotion of assistant educators to titles, as they do not bring ""systemic solutions or additional quality to the development of preschool education"".
""80 percent of the members of the Association of Directors of Slovenia believe that the current composition of the councils of institutions is certainly better than it would have been changed,"" said the president of the association Gregor Pečan. The principals' association agrees that the law needs to be changed, especially in the area of ​​the director's appointment, but ""the current attempt is extremely poorly prepared and actually allows for political influence on the director's selection and consequently on the policy of running public institutions.""
The president of the Slovenian Association of Researchers in the Field of Education, Jurka Lepičnik Vodopivec, emphasized that they were particularly concerned about the proposal in the part where it should contain professional bases for the proposed change, as it was ""contradictory and incomplete"". In addition, the proposal completely bypasses and ignores the achievements of the scientific research sphere. According to her, their results should be taken into account in the novella. The association thus agrees that the amendment to the law be withdrawn from consideration in the National Assembly.
""Once again, the parties of the ruling politics have submitted an amendment to the ZOFVI law without dialogue and without finding professionally thought-out solutions,"" said Danijela Makovec Radovan, president of the Association of Pedagogical Workers' Associations of Slovenia. ""These are changes that radically interfere with the education system and therefore require serious reflection and agreement, which politics must not and cannot make with itself, but with all relevant stakeholders,"" said Makovec Radovanova.
Damijan Štefanc, President of the Board of the Pedagogical Institute, pointed out at a press conference that education is one of the few subsystems in the country that has not yet succumbed to party politicization. “Also because safeguards have been thoughtfully built into the school system to convince such politicization,” he said. According to him, one such safeguard is the composition of school councils.
Branimir Štrukelj, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Education, Science and Culture of Slovenia (Sviz), said that Sviz had collected more than 24,000 signatures among employees in kindergartens and schools against the change in the composition of kindergarten and school councils. ""I wonder how it is possible that with this almost complete rejection of change, the ministry and the minister of education support the change,"" said Štrukelj.
At the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana, sharply above the proposal
As pointed out at the Faculty of Arts in Ljubljana, the proposal shows that the proponents want to intervene in the field of the composition of councils of institutions, the goals of education, the promotion of assistant educators and the collection of sensitive data.
The Law on the Organization and Financing of Education is the umbrella law that determines the most basic characteristics of our education, so any intervention in it should be adopted with the broadest possible consensus and based on a comprehensive analysis of the expected effects on the education system. Our education, and thus the law, needs to be renewed, it can be agreed. But this renovation must be carried out democratically and professionally, they stressed.
""Unfortunately, Croatia is cited as an example of good practice in the composition of school councils. principals are the local party in power.
The work of educational institutions is extremely demanding professional work nowadays, and if anything, conditions must be created in them in which principals will be able to play this role better than they can now, they pointed out.
Although the aspect of the local community is important, municipal officials or their representatives in the councils of institutions cannot competently judge and have decisive words about pedagogical leadership and the director's pedagogical merits. The argument of the proponents that the council of the institute has an ""administrative-supervisory role"" is also wrong and misleading. The council of the institute is a governing body, but not a supervisory body, as supervision is performed by other institutions determined by law (school inspectorate, labor inspectorate, court of audit), they warn.
Therefore, the claim of the proponents that the current composition of the council is a problem because the founders have ""all the responsibility"" for the director's work, but they cannot effectively control his work, is unbelievable, they are convinced.
However, the council of the institute has many competencies that are closely related to its professional activities: in schools it adopts the school development program and the annual work plan, discusses reports on educational issues, self-evaluation, etc. Therefore, in addition to participatory decision-making, the ability of professional judgment of the members of the council of the institute is also extremely important.
The proposed amendment is also professionally controversial in many other respects, they list: both their professional work and their responsibilities differ significantly, it establishes the basis for the central collection of a large amount of personal data, without it being clear why such collection is necessary, etc. ""
In a public letter, the Department of Pedagogy at the Faculty of Arts in Maribor draws attention to at least two professionally and systemically controversial changes that would have negative consequences if implemented. Like Sviz, they oppose a proposal to change the composition of kindergarten and school councils so that employee representatives lose two members (from five to three), while the number of representatives of the founder would increase by two members (from three to five).
In the Association of Pedagogical Workers' Associations of Slovenia, they are worried because the ruling politics has given up dialogue and the search for professionally thought-out solutions in this case as well. The proposal for a legal amendment is also strongly opposed at the Pedagogical Institute, where they point out that even after the existing legal regulation, the influence of the founder in the areas of business and financing is ensured as much as possible.
The left with its amendments
The Left Party announced that they oppose the reduction of the number of workers' representatives, ie pedagogues, school workers and professionals in the councils of public educational institutions, at the expense of increasing the number of representatives of the founders.
""Such reckless and politically motivated actions pose a serious risk to the quality of Slovenian education,"" they warn.
The Left has therefore prepared a set of amendments which, as they say, delete politically motivated changes from the bill. The amendments were also co-signed by the opposition parties LMŠ, SD, SAB and PS NeP.
""In the Left, we will not agree that a quality public education system sacrifices itself for the political interests of right-wing and conservative parties, which are trying to subjugate the school field and use it as a field of political struggle,"" they said.
""In the absence of any public debate on the proposed changes, we will oppose the adoption of the harmful proposal by all parliamentary means."" As they wrote, they will do everything to stop the adoption of the law and slow down its implementation, thus giving ""the opportunity to all employees in education, pedagogical experts and other students and other parts of civil society to publicly comment on the proposal, which significantly interferes with public schools and kindergartens. ""
Kustec: this is the recommendation of the Court of Audit
According to the Minister of Education Simona Kustec, any fear that one of the three parties in the world would have a majority is unnecessary. He points out that the Court of Audit, when auditing the operation of public institutions, made a recommendation that the role of the founder in educational institutions should be increased. The message of the Court of Audit is that the role of the founder, ie the municipality, and not the state, is the one that needs to be strengthened in the system, because, judging by the current regulation, it is too small, the minister is convinced."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/gospodarstvo/v-boj-z-odpadno-embalazo-bi-sli-s-kavcijskim-sistemom.html,We would go into the fight against packaging waste by returning the money for bottles and jars,"The Eco Circle Association sent a proposal to the Ministry of the Environment and political parties for legislative changes that could establish a deposit system in Slovenia for the collection of beverage packaging waste. This would mean that the consumer would pay an amount or a deposit when buying a drink for bottles, cans and bottles, which would be refunded when the packaging is returned to the collection point. Such a system is already known in many European countries.","For 15 years we have been observing the chaos with waste, which harms not only nature but also the budget. Valuable materials in waste are disappearing from Slovenia, while those with which we can do nothing and for which we pay citizens are accumulating and burning. we are cutting the tentacles of garbage lobbies and environmental crime, ""said Uroš Macerl, president of the Eco Circle, at a press conference.
The deposit system for bottles, cans and bottles is known in ten European countries, and in 15 it will be established in the coming years. The last country to take this step is Austria.
The deposit system means that the consumer pays an amount or a deposit when purchasing a beverage for packaging, which is refunded when the packaging is returned to the collection point.
In the poll plebiscite support for the proposal
As explained by the head of the Let's Close the Circle campaign Erika Oblak, research shows that countries with a bail system achieve the goals of European legislation related to packaging. The European Directive on Disposable Plastic Products, adopted in 2019, sets out, among other things, collection and recycling targets, according to which countries will have to collect 90% of their bottles separately by 2030. Also, the new bottles will have to contain at least 30 percent recyclable, and by 2030, countries will also have to recycle at least 55 percent of all plastic packaging.
The Eco Circle wants the deposit system to be the next step after the Clean Slovenia campaign, as most bottles are thrown away along the roads. The association also conducted a survey, which showed that more than 99 percent of the nearly 1,900 respondents would support the deposit system. However, because of all the advantages it brings, they are convinced that it should also be supported by politics. “Excuses that this is not possible are not true,” Macerl was clear.
The cooperation of both beverage producers and sellers would be needed
According to Aljoša Petek from the Legal Center for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment, who helped the association prepare amendments to the proposal for a new law on environmental protection, the legislation provides for a bail system, but this specificity requires the cooperation of beverage producers and sellers.
There is no such participation in the existing law, so the new law, which the government sent for parliamentary consideration, requires a small change, which could make a huge difference on Friday's opinion. On Friday, he also helped the association prepare a new regulation on the deposit system for beverage packaging, which covers this topic in more detail.
The association emphasizes that the deposit system has proven to be a cheaper, more efficient and more transparent system for collecting packaging waste. In addition, it opens up a new workplace, contributes to less waste and allows more reuse of beverage packaging and quality recycling. “I believe this is a step forward that we all gain,” Petek is convinced."

Representatives of the International Olympic Committee made a new video call with Peng and offered her support.","""Like many other people and organizations, we care about Peng's well-being and safety. That's why the IOC team made another video call with her yesterday. We offered her broad support, we will stay in regular contact with her, and we already agreed in January. for a personal meeting, ""a statement from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Lausanne said in a new press release.
""There are various ways to achieve her well-being and security. We have dealt with her situation very humanely and personally. As a three-time Olympian, the IOC addresses these concerns directly with Chinese sports organizations. We use 'silent diplomacy'. circumstances and, based on the experience of governments and other organizations, shows that it is the most promising way to deal effectively with such matters, ""the IOC wrote.
IOC President Thomas Bach held a half-hour video conference with Peng on November 21, during which the Chinese tennis player explained her position. Based on a long-distance conversation in the Olympic Committee, they conclude that she is safe and well given the difficult situation in which she found herself. ""This was reaffirmed in this call. Our human and personal way of working means that we continue to be concerned about her personal situation and will continue to support her,"" the IOC said in a statement.
The International Association of Tennis Players (WTA) has canceled all tournaments that China should host next year, including those in Hong Kong, due to the unresponsiveness of the Chinese authorities in the case of Peng Shuai, WTA President Steve Simon said.
Ever since 35-year-old Peng, a former world number one in women's doubles and two-time Grand Slam winner of Wimbledon (2013) and Paris (2014) with Taiwanese Hsieh Su Wei, a former high-ranking Chinese politician, accused her of sexual assault in early November. The WTA has repeatedly expressed deep concern over the unclear fate of the tennis player.
Chinese authorities have not announced the whereabouts of the tennis player after her sudden and unannounced disappearance. Neither the accused Zhang Gaoli, the former deputy prime minister of China, nor the current Chinese government have commented on Peng's accusations, and the discussion on this topic has been blocked on the Chinese Internet. A few minutes after the announcement, all of her posts relating to her relationship with Gaoli were deleted. For a while, Peng disappeared from public life."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/kadrovski-pretresi-v-slovenski-energetiki.html,Personnel shocks in the Slovenian energy sector,"At a crucial time when we have record growth in electricity, gas and heating prices and when questions about energy supply are open in the future - due to the abandonment of coal and the closure of the mine, Teša and the second nuclear power plant - we are witnessing a series of staff changes. Some leaders flew away: Andrej Ribič, Boris Sovič, Alan Perc, Robert Golob. How will this affect market stability? Will the exchanges continue?","The state owns almost the entire Slovenian energy sector, and staff changes in state-owned companies are already a constant. We are currently witnessing personnel shocks at the top of state-owned and state-owned energy companies. Andrej Ribič had to leave the position of President of Elektro Ljubljana after ten years, Boris Sovič was recalled from the top of Elektro Maribor, the head of Energetika Maribor, Alan Perc, was recalled due to high heating prices, and Robert Golob did not get a new head of Gen-I. mandate. The management of Gen-I is currently being decided by the court in Krško, which, according to Golob, is something completely new. ""Even Slovenian politics has never fallen as low as in this case, nor do we have any case law yet…"" The court has so far received three proposals for the interim administration of Gen-I. According to two proposals, it would continue to be led by Robert Golob, and after the third, by Martin Novšak, General Manager of Gen Energija, which is half the owner of Gen-I.
Two companies in Holding Slovenske elektrarne (HSE) will also get new management - yesterday, 1 December, Aleksander Brunčko took the chair of the General Manager of Dravske elektrarne Maribor, and the new director of the company will be Damjan Seme. Aleksander Brunčko is a member of the SDS party and sits on the finance committee in the Ruše municipality. Brunčko is a former procurator of HSE Invest and an assistant to Andrej Tumpe, the current general manager of Dravske elektrarne Maribor.
In January, Matjaž Vodušek, former director of SODO, the system operator of the distribution network, will become the general director of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (Teš). He has led SODO since its establishment in 2007, and was appointed during the first Janša government. Vodušek will replace Viktor Vračar, who is the General Manager of HSE. For the time being, the director of Teša remains Mitja Tašler.
Infrastructure Minister Jernej Vrtovec announced staff changes in July, when he said: ""If we want to manage long-term investments properly and carry them out with quality, we will soon have to decide to thank individuals who have been in certain fields for 15 years or more for work done."" Now, however, he claims he has nothing to do with exchanges. ""These changes have been decided by the supervisors, I have to accept them, whether I like them or not, they are accepted by other decision-makers.""
Robert Golob says the excuse to make exchanges any policy is very convenient. ""In reality, however, we see that in these cases there are slightly more well-thought-out goals in the background, which do not stop at one-off actions and taking office, but are long-term and above all financial, which means long-term positions. a future that we will channel in our own way. "" Both Petrol and HSE did not want to comment on the current changes of management, because they say that this is a matter for each company individually. According to Golob, exchanges in energy companies have not yet been completed. ""I know first hand that we're about halfway there.""
The two pillars of energy, HSE and Gen energija, are 100% state-owned
The state is 100% owner of the two main pillars of Slovenian energy, HSE and Gen energija. At the same time, it has a stake in Petrol, Geoplin and Elektro Maribor, Ljubljana and Celje.
Since November and December last year, HSE has had a new management board, the general director is Viktor Vračar, appointed from the SMC quota. He replaced Stojan Nikolić in this position. The Management Board also consists of business directors, Marko Štrigl and Uroš Podobnik, who falls within the NSi quota. Prior to that, Štrigl was the Deputy Director of ECE, which has been 51% owned by HSE since October this year. Until December last year, he was a member of the supervisory board of the Municipality of Šoštanj, and he ran on the Youth for Šoštanj list. Six changes of members (especially last year) took place in the HSE Supervisory Board, among the supervisors are Andrej Janša, the NSi candidate for mayor of Veliki Lašče in the 2018 local elections, and Robert Celec, a member of the SMC.
A year ago, we reported in detail on personnel changes in HSE in the Facts project, Personnel Counter.
How important is HSE's role in energy? HSE is the largest producer and seller of electricity from its own, domestic sources on the wholesale market in Slovenia - they produce 65 percent of the country's electricity. They are the largest Slovenian producer of electricity from renewable sources and produce more than 70 percent of renewable energy sources in Slovenia. ""Renewable sources predominate, this year and last year they represented the majority share, although we are only known for Teš and the coal mine, which in fact already represent a minority share,"" says Vračar.
HSE owns hydropower companies, including Dravske elektrarne Maribor, Soške elektrarne Nova Gorica, Črpalna hidroelektrarna Avče, and in thermoproduction: Termoelektrarna Šoštanj, which produces one third of Slovenian electricity, and HSE Energetska družba Trbovlje (EDT), which is the legal successor of Termo. Trbovlje. They have their own primary energy source, coal, which is part of the Velenje Coal Mine. Teš uses this coal to produce electricity, but due to climate commitments he will have to abandon its use, the only question is when. Therefore, the fate of the coal mine and Teša is unclear.
In October this year, HSE bought a 51% stake in ECE, a provider of electricity, natural gas and wood biomass. ""After twenty years, we have successfully entered the retail market this year. In the procedure before the Agency for the Protection of Competition, we have an application for consent for a similar entry into Maribor's Energija Plus. , ""explains Viktor Vračar. Last year, HSE had a loss of 227 million, compared to a profit of 60 million the year before.
National Nuclear Pillar - Gene Energy
Gen energija is the main company in the Gen group and half owner of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant, which produces more than 30 percent of electricity in Slovenia. At the same time, it owns the Sava Power Plant Ljubljana, the Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Lower Sava and the Brestanica Thermal Power Plant. She is also a half-owner of Gen-I, which is the largest supplier of electricity in Slovenia, and also sells natural gas. The latter owns Elektro energija. An even bigger player in the energy market could be Gen energija in the future, if the idea of ​​the second block of the nuclear power plant, JEK 2, comes to life in practice. ""Therefore, Slovenia has issued an energy permit for the second block of the nuclear power plant, and we are also conducting all procedures to extend the operation of the existing block of the nuclear power plant for another 20 years, until 2043,"" explains Jernej Vrtovec. But they are waiting for the European Union's green light - a group of ten EU member states, including Slovenia, has called on the European Commission to recognize nuclear energy as a low-carbon way of obtaining energy.
At the top of Gen energija is Martin Novšak. Since June this year, Gen energija has had a new financial director, Gordana Radanovič, who was the director of the Brežice Municipality. The managing director is Danijel Levičar, who was the head of the energy directorate at the Ministry of Infrastructure when it was headed by Peter Gašperšič from SMC. The chairman of the supervisory board, who decided on the new management board of Gen-I and did not give a mandate to Robert Golob, is Cvetko Sršen from the SDS, the chairman of the board of Telekom Slovenije, which is majority owned by the state (more than 70 percent). Gen energija ended the year with a profit of more than 45 million euros.
In the field of petroleum products, an important player is partly state-owned Petrol
Together with OMV, Petrol is the main supplier of petroleum products on the Slovenian market, and also offers electricity and natural gas. He is indirectly the owner of Plinovodi, which is the operator of the natural gas transmission system. Petrol owns 30 percent of Plinhold, and the remaining 60 percent is state-owned. Plinhold is the owner of Plinovodi. Based on the division plan, the General Meeting of Geoplin in 2017 adopted a resolution on the status transformation of the company Geoplin, thus the company Plinhold was established, to which the capital investment in the company Plinovodi was transferred. Petrol is the half owner of the company Geoenergo, which has the only concession for the exploitation of mineral resources, oil and natural gas in the area of ​​the Mura Depression, which also includes Petišovci. The remaining half is state-owned through Nafta Lendava.
Among the largest private owners of Petrol are Darij and Vesna Južna, their ownership is about 10 percent. Environment Minister Andrej Vizjak, also a personal friend of Darijo Južna, bought large quantities of Petrol shares last year. The President of the Management Board of Petrol is Nada Drobne Popovič, before joining Petrol she was the first financier of Acroni owned by the Slovenian Steel Industry.
What is the competition on the Slovenian retail market?
Let's look at the competition on the Slovenian energy market to make it easier to imagine which companies play an important role. In electricity, Gen-I has the largest market share of suppliers for households, last year it had a good 20 percent market share of electricity with end customers. They are followed by ECE, which is now (since October this year) majority owned by the state-owned HSE, and E3, the three suppliers control more than 56 percent of the market. Nevenka Hrovatin from the Faculty of Economics estimates that competition in the electricity market has been increasing in recent years.
""Both the retail market of suppliers to households and the market of suppliers to business customers are moderately concentrated, and in addition, the market shares of suppliers have changed, indicating market competitiveness."" The competitiveness of the market is also evidenced by a comparison of the movement of wholesale and retail electricity prices. Retail prices generally followed wholesale prices, which means that suppliers' margins in the retail market were stable, with the exception of last year, when margins rose. This may indicate less market competitiveness and insufficient customer activity in switching suppliers.
The EU report, which in 2020 sought to identify obstacles to the entry of new suppliers into the retail electricity and gas market for 30 European countries (27 EU member states and the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Norway), confirms the competitiveness of the Slovenian market. Slovenia ranks second in the electricity market and slightly worse in the gas market, 11th. In terms of natural gas, Energetika Ljubljana is the largest provider, followed by Gen-I, followed by Petrol.
The retail gas market for household customers is moderately (moderately) concentrated, although the combined market share of the three largest companies is still relatively large (62%), otherwise declining in recent years.
In the oil market, we have Duopol, Petrol and OMW. The other is withdrawing from Slovenia, Mol is coming. The Competition Protection Agency is in charge of monitoring market competitiveness and possible abuse of monopoly power, and the market situation is also monitored by the Ministry of Economic Development, which currently sees no reason to take action. This is understandable, says Nevenka Hrovatin, as prices change similarly to other EU countries.
Will current trade affect market stability and energy poverty?
Energy prices have reached record levels this year. As a result, some energy providers have raised electricity and gas prices, most of which affect the socially disadvantaged and the energy poor. According to Robert Golob, the fact that Gen-I did not raise prices is the reason why the company became interested in politics. ""If you have the same prices for eight years, then you are certainly not a generator of energy poverty, but a buffer. If someone in politics decides that this buffer can also be destroyed, then that means they are really actively working to have as much energy poverty as possible. ""Why? Then to emerge as the savior of a problem that didn't exist before.""
Vrtovec reassures that the current change of leadership will not affect the supply of people with energy. ""In Slovenia, we have enough energy experts who can handle different tasks, and this will not help. We have different strategies and measures at the ministry; the ministry is independent of who is where. At the ministry, we take care of legislation that is ready for all times, strategies are ready for key answers in the present and future. So we have key answers no matter who is in what position. ""
In the 24UR Fokus column and the second block of the nuclear power plant, Tomislav Tkalec from the Focus association said that politics is a leading cadre without strategic consideration and quickly changes with candidates from its circles. ""We have a very good connection of officials who come to the ministry and then in the role of decision-makers. They come mostly from these two pillars (HSE and Gen-I) or maybe from another company. are ultimately accepted, benefit these two great pillars and maintain the status quo. """

""How can I explain to our actresses that they should play where Peng Shuai is not allowed to communicate freely with the public and obviously restrain it against its will by various methods. Of course, I also fear for the safety of our actresses, who should perform in 2022. China, ""wrote President Simon.
He added that he had received numerous responses of support and that the decision to cancel or suspend the tournaments was made with the consent of the WTA Board of Directors.
On November 21, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the president of the umbrella sports organization, Thomas Bach, had a half-hour video interview with Peng. The evidence so far that she is alive and well, however, was published mainly in the Chinese media, where a week ago a video and photo of Peng Shuai were published at the opening of the youth tournament in Beijing.
Chinese authorities have not announced the whereabouts of the missing tennis player. Neither defendant Chang Gaoli, a former Chinese deputy prime minister, nor the current Chinese government have commented on Peng's allegations. The discussion on this topic, however, was blocked on the heavily censored Chinese Internet, as well as on other social networks."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/v-ljubljani-20-odstotna-podrazitev-ogrevanja-petrol-zvisal-cene-elektrike-in-plina.html,"In Ljubljana, 20% increase in heating prices, Petrol raised electricity and gas prices","As of today, heating in the district heating system is more expensive in Ljubljana. Namely, Energetika Ljubljana increased the variable part of the price of heat by 25.98 percent, which will be reflected in the bills of users as a 20% increase in the price of heating. As of today, Petrol will increase the prices of electricity and natural gas.","Energetika Ljubljana, which supplies district heating to around 60,000 households, cites extraordinary increases in energy prices and emission coupons as the reason for the increase in the variable part of the heat price. At the same time, it ensures that heat prices will not rise further by the end of the heating season. It also has no plans to raise natural gas and electricity prices.
Primož Škerl from Energetika Ljubljana says that this increase is ""the last until the end of March or April, depending on how long the heating season lasts, a 70-square-meter apartment will pay about 124 euros more annually for heating"".
Even more, the new price list will hit those who heat their houses. If last year's total heating costs amounted to more than 1,750 euros - this year the bills will be more than 300 euros more expensive. ""Currently, we do not predict a rise in the price of electricity and natural gas, but it is difficult to predict what will happen in the future,"" Škerl added.
As of today, Petrol will increase the price of electricity and natural gas. According to the regular price list, the price of electricity for households will increase by about 30 percent, and the final bill for the average household electricity consumer will be higher by about seven euros per month or just over 10 percent. Natural gas will rise by 12 percent. According to the Energy Agency, Petrol had an 11.6% market share last year in electricity and 9.2% in natural gas.
Other providers do not intend to increase electricity prices this year, as explained in the companies Ece, Elektro energija, Energija plus, E3 and Gen-I. In the latter, they pledged not to raise electricity and natural gas prices until at least the summer of 2022.
Due to high prices, the director of Energetika Maribor was dismissed
13,000 households or 40,000 people are connected to Energetika Maribor. Already the bills for October are more expensive, and many are anxiously awaiting November and December.
On Tuesday afternoon, Maribor Mayor Saša Arsenovič convened a meeting of leaders of council groups to discuss possible measures due to high heating prices in the municipality, which are currently even the highest in Slovenia. Due to the situation, the Supervisory Board of Energetika Maribor dismissed the long-time director of Energetika Maribor, Alan Perc.
As Arsenovič said after the meeting in Maribor, the meeting of the council groups was due to problems in the operations of Energetika Maribor, which were not influenced by the city's policy. According to him, there have been significant changes in the expected business results of the company, according to what the management presented at the September and later at the November meeting of the Supervisory Board.
According to Arsenović, Minister Jernej Vrtovec responded in such a way that the state would respond to the current problem of rising energy prices and thus more expensive heating, not only because of Maribor, but at the level of the entire country. This is supposed to be done with t. i. energy vouchers.
Since Maribor is aware that this will not be enough, at today's meeting they looked for possible solutions for Energetika Maribor, as they do not want red numbers given the otherwise good business of all other companies within the city holding. According to the mayor, the holding will therefore enable those who wish to pay the difference between last year's and this year's heating price in months outside the heating season.
""If last year the payment for heating was 40 euros and this year it would be 100, users will be able to pay 120 euros in December and January for the period between April and September. This will make the price for heating in winter even lower than in most Slovenian cities, ""Arsenovich said. At the City Council meeting, he will propose the distribution of vouchers with money from the city budget.
Regarding the dismissal of Perc, the mayor also said that the solutions for more affordable heating prices, which he put on the table, would not save the company's operations. At the same time, he blamed Perc that the club did not provide various energy sources for the successful 12-year management of this public company, so that heating depends almost exclusively on gas.
The Minister of Labor, Janez Cigler Kralj, said that they were monitoring the daily movement of the prices of these energy sources if it was necessary to cut with energy vouchers. ""So far, this need has not been detected."" If - according to Zigler Kralj - the growth of prices continues, the government will intervene and try to find a solution for the weakest with the intervention law."

The opposition expressed support for the proposed amendment to the law, but the Left pointed out that the SDS party had expressed opposition between the lines. The parties announced that they would examine the details and give their views in the coming days.","Igor Zorčič said that this was a law that had already been repealed in a certain part five months ago, but neither the government nor the National Assembly had implemented the US decision. such a law. "" According to him, there is a certain willingness among parliamentary groups to cooperate.
As he said, it is more than obvious that dissatisfaction prevails among the people due to the measures that are to some extent taken with a deficient legal basis. ""In recent days, MEPs have received numerous e-mails from a dissatisfied group of citizens who point out that the PKP 10 proposal also includes a proposal to adopt decrees to limit the spread of the epidemic. I think this warning is appropriate. The National Assembly changed the law so that it would file an amendment to the ZNB and so that this would not be regulated in other laws, and so that what the Constitutional Court pointed out would be included in the content. ""

Janja Sluga from the group of unaffiliated deputies said that the group supports the proposal of the Network for the Protection of Democracy. ""The advantage is that it was prepared by the profession and not by politics. Our position is that today's consultation was good. I think that all parliamentary groups should submit a proposal. We have no major concerns.""
The question is very difficult, says Maša Kociper (SAB), but she finds the proposal good. ""We also welcome the fact that the government is more limited in the duration of measures. This law answers these questions and introduces some parliamentary scrutiny. On the one hand, the government needs to be given space and ability to react quickly We will talk and deepen in the party and then give our answer. But we are worried that if the law is not signed by all the parliamentary groups, the coalition will be able to change it and put something of its own into it. ""
Matjaž Han (SD) said that they did not care who was the first to sign, it was important that they were all together. He is also pleased that this is a proposal being prepared by civil society.
The Left welcomes the initiative. According to Matej T. Vatovec, the presented proposal is also ""the best basis so far for continuing talks on the ZNB, which arouses fear in the work of the public. The fact is that we need this law in a renewed form in accordance with the constitution. We have no major concerns. . "" He said that they still need to examine it in detail and that the continuation of the procedure should follow soon. ""However, I am afraid that the proposal will not be successful and that not all parties will be involved."" He had in mind the largest government party, the SDS, which, between the lines, expressed its disagreement with the novelties, with all the safeguards and controls of the National Assembly, because this government is supposed to restrict its work. ""Unfortunately, this coalition is trying to circumvent exactly what the ZNB should determine with strange omissions, such as PKP 10, in which it introduces certain provisions. I am afraid that there will be no unity that the coalition is constantly promoting."" he added.
In matters that cause public discomfort, fear and mistrust, it is important that politics and civil society connect and cooperate, said Brane Golubovič (LMŠ). ""This is happening these days. Civil society has prepared a proposal of the ZNB, which implements the proposal of the Constitutional Court. Politics reacted very quickly and held a consultation. It is very important that the public is informed about everything. or more.""
Following the receipt of the bill on communicable diseases, the convening of the working conference was proposed in the parliamentary group of unaffiliated deputies (NeP). As they explained, they believe that this is a good legal basis that follows the decisions of the Constitutional Court and establishes parliamentary control over the measures adopted by the government. At the same time, the NeP is convinced that changes to the law on infectious diseases are necessary and that the National Assembly could take the initiative by submitting an amendment to the law by all parliamentary groups that support it.
Prior to the conference, the SAB parliamentary group announced that they had received the bill and were still studying it, as it was a complex legal matter. They welcome the efforts of the Legal Network for the Protection of Democracy to eliminate unconstitutionality, but at the same time point out that the coalition has a majority in the National Assembly. ""Therefore, there is a risk that the existing text in the legislative process will be redrafted with amendments and thus changed regardless of the proposer,"" they said.
The SMC, DeSUS and SNS parliamentary groups announced that they would first examine the proposed amendment to the Infectious Diseases Act and then comment on its content. Thus, it is expected that more will be known about the support for the proposed amendment to the law after today's consultation of the leaders of the parliamentary groups.
The National Assembly did not approve the amendment to the Infectious Diseases Act with a 78-vote vote in July, following a veto by the National Council. Coalition deputies also voted against, saying that it was sensible to study some criticisms and concerns about the amendment and prepare a new text, which the government has not done so far."

That Teš, who has become synonymous with corruption due to the non-transparent construction of the sixth block, is imbued with house searches. We paid 1.4 billion euros for the sixth block, and five years later we are agreeing to abandon the use of coal due to climate commitments, the closure of the mine and, consequently, the thermal power plant. However, 1,400 jobs are at risk.","Due to the construction of the sixth block of the thermal power plant, one of the most important energy facilities in Slovenia - the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (TEŠ) - has become synonymous with corruption. Malfunctions in Teš are also a constant. On the other hand, Viktor Vračar, General Manager of Holding Slovenske Elektrarne (HSE) and General Manager of Teša until 1 January next year, said that it was ""one of the most modern units of its kind, not only in Europe but also beyond"".
The Teš 6 affair has still not received an epilogue. After almost ten years since the house searches and after five years of operation, the actors of the Teš 6 affair have just sat on the dock this year. It is known that the value of the investment rose from the original 654 million euros to 1.4 billion euros. The new sixth block was supposedly a good opportunity for private earnings. Former Teša director Uroš Rotnik, employees Darko Weiss, Jože Lenart and Miran Leben and others involved are suspected of EUR 250 million worth of damage to Teša during construction. Rotnik, who pleads not guilty, is charged by the prosecution with two offenses of abuse of office or trust in economic activity, one offense of abuse of office or rights and two offenses of money laundering. The prosecution accuses the co-defendants of the same crimes and aiding and abetting criminal offenses in the case of alleged irregularities in several Teš transactions. This is one of the most extensive indictments in Slovenia, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison, and the case will expire in 2028.
Teš has been in the red in recent years, last year he even had a loss of 280 million, the year before he was 'only' 20 million. Teš puts the prices of emission coupons, which it has to buy due to the release of Co2 emissions into the air, in an unenviable financial position. Teša's management explains that the business was affected by the higher price of emission coupons, which increased by 15 percent last year, and especially the weakening of assets. HSE's borrowings related to the sixth block investment amount to 65 million to repay annuities and around 20 million to repay financing and guarantee costs.
This year, Teš also received 131 million in compensation from a settlement with the American group General Electric, the legal successor of the supplier of equipment for Alstom's sixth unit.
Analysis of the projection of potential profitability Teš from 2021 to 2030 estimates that the total losses in the most probable scenario of projected prices of CO2 coupons and electricity prices will be around 930 million euros. The coal mine also has a loss, last year it amounted to just under ten million euros.
Today, Teš produces a third of Slovenia's electricity using coal, earning 228 million euros from electricity sales last year.
The Ministry of Infrastructure supports the year 2033, environmentalists warn that we are late
While the court is seeking responsibility for the alleged damage to Teš, the government must prepare a plan for when and how we will stop using coal, the main source of electricity production in Teš. A National Strategy for Coal Exit and Restructuring of Coal Regions in Accordance with the Principles of Fair Transition has been prepared, proposing three scenarios for phasing out coal use - 2033, 2038 and 2042. The Ministry of Infrastructure supports the year 2033. ""Not fixed, not concreted, but contains additional audits. That is, an audit will be done every two years, whether we are pursuing all the goals, whether it is possible 2033 or not. Is it possible earlier, ""says Minister Jernej Vrtovec.
Tomislav Tkalec from the Focus association estimates that the year 2033 is already a bit late, but the only acceptable one from those mentioned in the strategy. Focus believes that due to the commitments made in the Paris Agreement, coal should be abandoned by 2030 at the latest, as will the 14 EU Member States. But it is very likely that, due to the rapid rise in emission coupon prices, Teš could close its doors before 2033, says Tkalec. ""The longer a power plant works, the greater the losses it generates."" Therefore, the decision for one of the later years of coal abandonment in the SAŠA region could lead to the sudden and unplanned closure of Teš without the region being prepared for it.
Jože Koritnik from the Slovenian Mining Association of Engineers and Technicians (SRDIT) believes that 10 years is not enough time to close such a complex mine as the Velenje Coal Mine. ""A mine is like a man, he is born, he lives and one day, when he runs out of mineral resources or the demand for mineral resources in the market stops, he also dies. Another story is related to location, tradition, economic and social situation."" SRDIT warns that there is no case of successful restructuring of the mining region in Europe in a good ten years. We can only guess what the risk would be in the case of Premogovnik Velenje, where there is a much larger number of endangered jobs, and in a significantly shorter time provided for restructuring, they add.
Climate commitments dictate the abandonment of coal
With the ratification of the Paris Agreement in 2016, Slovenia has committed itself to abandoning coal by 2030. ""The abandonment of coal use is the path taken by the developed world, and Slovenia cannot be an exception in this regard,"" they say at HSE. It is therefore a matter of abandoning the raw material that has been exploited for centuries. This also directly affects the Velenje Coal Mine, which is the main carrier of the coal mining activity. Coal has been mined since 1875. The excavated coal is supplied to the nearby Teš. So the key question is, when will Slovenia abandon coal?
Endangered jobs of 1,400 employees in Teš and the mine
There are currently 1,400 employees dependent on coal at Teš and the coal mine. ""Unfortunately, these are the times when we have to look for substitutability, CO2 coupons are growing, Teša's business is really threatened and we have to take this step forward, despite tradition,"" says Vrtovec.
Viktor Vračar does not believe in new big employers. Following the example of other coal regions around the world and restructuring, I think that more smaller, more innovative companies will move in, based on various services and other activities that really need to be stepped up to ensure social and otherwise acceptable transition. ""
Robert Golob, Gen-I, believes that more jobs will be brought to Slovenia by solar energy than there are today in the Šaleška Valley. ""There will be more, three times as many. Those who take an active part in it will also earn. Green transformation is, if you do it right, a unique business opportunity. And many people do not want to hear it because there is competition or politics. he can't make a plan. ""
The transition to a low-carbon economy means that some jobs will be lost, some changed or. restructured and upgraded, and a significant number of ‘green’ jobs will be created, Focus estimates. Already in the Paris Agreement, it is estimated that the net effect of the green transition on the number of jobs will be positive. The transition will inevitably lead to job losses in some carbon-intensive sectors, but that number will be offset by new job opportunities, they add.
The HSE estimates that up to 1,500 people will be tied to the mine in 2033, but after the completion of active excavation, this number will gradually fall. ""In recent years, we estimate we will need about 250 people.""
They cannot talk about the exact costs of closing the mine at HSE
HSE says that the closure of the coal mine would take a long time, at least 15 years, because it includes more than 50 kilometers of active tunnels, which will have to be rehabilitated after the closure. ""Given that the year of closure is not yet final, we can't talk about the exact cost of closure.""
According to Vrtovec, money from the European Fund for Fair Transition, which is a key instrument for supporting regions in the transition to climate neutrality by 2050, is more than enough. But first, the government must adopt a national strategy, which is the basis for two key laws to close the coal mine and restructure the region. If we do not adopt the strategy by the end of this year, we will not be able to draw 235 million euros from the fund, only in the first phase. So we are already late, Tkalec is clear. ""The government is certainly not doing enough, which is clearly seen in the fact that this strategy for the exit from coal has not yet been adopted, which should have been adopted as early as the beginning of the summer.""
According to the Minister of Infrastructure, the law on closing the mine is in the preparation phase at the Ministry of Infrastructure, and the strategy is ready, it is in interdepartmental discussion. ""In the coming weeks, I believe that the strategy would be adopted if the other stakeholders, ie the ministries, agree on the year and all the other elements in this strategy."" The law on the restructuring of the region comes from another ministry, Vrtovec added.
HSE: 'We want to preserve the energy location'
The Šaleška Valley is an important energy location, so Teš with domestic lignite should be considered and used as a strategic support to Slovenia's efforts for a gradual transition to a carbon-free society, not as an obstacle, according to HSE. ""We plan to maintain the energy location in Šoštanj and projects for the production of electricity from low- or non-carbon sources, including green hydrogen production. The HSE Group has projects for renewable energy sources and low-carbon electricity production, which could help replace production from Teš . "" They add that the Teš energy location is equipped with infrastructure, both for the production of electricity from gas and hydrogen production, and a location for capturing and using CO2 is also planned.
There is a possibility that Teš will be transformed into something else, says Vrtovec. ""We have a facility that we have to use in the future, one of the possibilities is definitely gas. In Germany, gas is recognized as a transitional element for 30, 40 years. Whether this will be the case in Slovenia, we do not know at the moment, but it is a pity that Teša's location should be neglected. ""
But Golob believes that HSE and Teš have enough other important challenges, including the entire region, to deal with what will happen to this location after 2030. ""The thermal power plant in Trbovlje has been closed for at least five years, but nothing has grown at this location. ""Then why deal with a location in Tesh if we don't really know if we're going to need it. Let's focus on what's important, not where someone might be able to pull some commissions again."" He says that Teš is a system facility, which it makes sense to keep in operation until 2030, also due to the reliability of the system. ""Slovenian energy needs time to restructure its system in order to withstand the exclusion of Teš. These two goals, both strategic, are measured in significantly more money than the possible loss from the coupon, which would increase from the current 60 euros to 100 ""Especially since we know that this money is largely flowing into the climate fund, which we are actually getting back.""
In RUDIT, they agree with HSE that closing Teša does not make sense. ""It would make sense to convert it into a cogeneration unit (also equipped with a treatment unit), where fuel from waste would also be thermally used. Every year in Slovenia, in CERO Ljubljana alone, more than 100,000 tons of fuel are generated from waste. - exploited abroad. ""
How are we going to fill the electricity gap from Tesh?
According to Robert Golob, Europe is likely to ban coal in 2030, and solar energy will fill the gap in electricity losses from Tesh. ""We have two enemies, we have an enemy who is called: we don't want objects that damage space and we have time running out. When we put these two together, it turns out that the combination of nuclear and sun is basically optimal because it meets both criteria, ""Golob said. ""So the sun will not only replace Teš, the sun will replace Teš and at the same time it will take care of one part of the additional consumption that will result from the electrification of the vehicle fleet."" It should be emphasized that Gen Energija, which is half the owner of Gen-I, is also half the owner of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant.
SRDIT, on the other hand, believes that the expectations that the loss will be replaced by renewable energy sources by 2033 in the event of the abandonment of coal use, with an emphasis on solar energy, are unrealistic. ""At the moment, solar energy contributes a little more than two percent to Slovenia's electricity production. We are seriously concerned about the potentially much greater import dependence of Slovenia on electricity and what it can mean in terms of quality of life and competitiveness of our economy. . ""
Vračar said: ""If there are no breakthrough solutions, Slovenia will really not be able to achieve this sufficiency without a new nuclear bloc.""
Germany is the only country planning to exit coal after 2030
Among the EU countries, there are already six countries without thermal power plants today, 14 of which have committed to the abolition of coal by 2030 at the latest. according to Energy Minister Peter Altmeier, due to the uneconomical nature of coal abandoned much earlier, say in Focus. The analysis 'Farewell to coal is happening faster than expected - 60% of coal-fired power plants are expected to close in the EU by 2030', which presents an analysis of the closure of coal-fired power plants in Europe closure of almost 60 percent of coal-fired power plants by 2030. Given the tightening of the financial picture of the operation of the rest, according to Tkalec, it is expected that there will be many more closures."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/energetika-ljubljana-z-decembrom-drazi-daljinsko-ogrevanje.html,"Energetika Ljubljana with price increases, director of Energetika Maribor dismissed due to high prices","On Tuesday afternoon, Maribor Mayor Saša Arsenovič convened a meeting of leaders of council groups to discuss possible measures due to high heating prices in the municipality, which are currently even the highest in Slovenia. Due to the situation, the Supervisory Board of Energetika Maribor dismissed the long-time director of Energetika Maribor, Alan Perc. From December, Energetika Ljubljana will also increase the variable part of the price of heat in district heating in Ljubljana by 25.98 percent, and the increase will be expressed as a 20% increase in heating prices at the expense of users. For the time being, the prices of natural gas and electricity at Energetika Ljubljana remain unchanged.","As Arsenovič said after the meeting in Maribor, the meeting of the council groups was due to problems in the operations of Energetika Maribor, which were not influenced by the city's policy. According to him, there have been significant changes in the expected business results of the company, according to what the management presented at the September and later at the November meeting of the Supervisory Board.
""The expected results went against a deficit of three to four million euros at the group level. At a meeting with the Minister of Infrastructure Jernej Vrtovec on Friday, we gave Perc the opportunity to explain the challenges related to rising energy prices in the markets and business decisions that were wrongly made, ”the mayor said.
According to Arsenović, Vrtovec reacted in such a way that the state will respond to the current problem of raising energy prices and thus more expensive heating, not only because of Maribor, but at the level of the entire country. This is supposed to be done with t. i. energy vouchers, most likely € 150, and with the help of pensioners with the lowest pensions.
Proposed solution: installment payment of the difference between last year's and this year's heating price
Since Maribor is aware that this will not be enough, at today's meeting they looked for possible solutions for Energetika Maribor, as they do not want red numbers given the otherwise good business of all other companies within the city holding. According to the mayor, the holding will therefore enable those who wish to pay the difference between last year's and this year's heating price in months outside the heating season.
""If last year the payment for heating was 40 euros and this year it would be 100, users will be able to pay 120 euros in December and January for the period between April and September. This will make the price for heating in winter even lower than in most Slovenian cities, ""Arsenovich said. At the City Council meeting, he will propose the distribution of vouchers with money from the city budget.
According to him, the amount of the city voucher has not been harmonized yet, but it will amount to 10 to 15 euros, and it is not yet clear whether it will be intended for all or only those citizens who are connected to heating through Energetika Maribor. In the latter case, there are about 13,000 households or 40,000 citizens.
Perca was temporarily replaced by the director of the holding company of public companies Andrej Rihter
Regarding the dismissal of Perc, the mayor also said that the solutions for more affordable heating prices, which he put on the table, would not save the company's operations. At the same time, he blamed Perc that the club did not provide various energy sources for the successful 12-year management of this public company, so that heating depends almost exclusively on gas.
""New challenges await the energy sector in the future, and I believe that in the tender conducted by the supervisory board in the shortest possible time, we will get such a new director who will only deal with energy,"" said the mayor. He added that Perca was temporarily replaced by the director of the holding company of public companies Andrej Rihter. He denied that Perc was not allowed to attend today's session, but said that he had not been invited to it.
The opposition is not enthusiastic about the solutions. LPR City Councilor Stojan Auer also blamed the supervisors for the situation in the company. ""Some will now receive some minimal vouchers, and only those who are connected to energy. We believe that it would be necessary to help everyone in Maribor, as we are obliged to take care of all citizens, not just those affected by mistakes. The holding company only gives them the option of repayment in installments, so the mistakes will in any case have to be paid for by the citizens themselves, ""Auer said.
Energetika Ljubljana cites extraordinary increases in energy prices and emission coupons as the reason for the increase in the variable part of the heat price. The variable part will thus increase by 25.98 percent to 75.33989 euros per megawatt hour from December. Compared to the November variable price, this is 15 euros per megawatt hour more.
However, since the final price of heat consists of a fixed and a variable part, the increase in the variable part of the final heating bill will be 20 percent, the company explains.
""The total annual cost excluding taxes and VAT will increase by 124.29 euros for an average 70-square-meter apartment to 804.03 euros, and by 310.73 euros for an average 200-square-meter house, and will amount to EUR 2,065.99, ""explained Energetika Ljubljana, which will no longer raise heat prices by the end of the heating season.
The company also has no plans to raise natural gas and electricity prices."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/dejstva/rekordno-trgovanje-cistega-zraka.html,Record clean air trading,"There are 34 plants in Slovenia - thermal power plants, heating plants and producers of steel, ceramics and paper - that trade in emission coupons. Among them, the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant emits the most CO2 emissions. Coupons are also traded by individuals, companies that have used trading for a good deal. One of the most successful in trading is Boštjan Bandelj. The issue coupons reached record prices this year - even more than 70 euros. How will the rise in prices affect the operations of the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant?","In order to reduce environmental pollution from CO2 emissions from industrial plants, the European Commission introduced an emissions trading scheme in 2005. In practice, this means limiting the annual amount of CO2 at the state level, which then distributes the amount of emissions by plant. The devices include power plants, industrial plants and airlines, which must report by 30 April each year how many allowances they have used. One coupon equals one tonne of carbon dioxide released into the air by pollutants. Coupons can then be traded freely. Some coupons are given to polluters for free, if they release more carbon dioxide into the air than they have for free coupons, they have to buy more. On the other hand, surpluses can be sold. But the prices of coupons are record high this year, in November one coupon amounted to just under 73 euros. Until a few years ago, prices ranged below 10 euros.
In Slovenia, the emission coupon trading system currently includes 34 operators, all thermal power plants and heating plants, production of steel, glass, ceramics, cement, lime and paper. Approximately 40 percent of Slovenia's emissions are monitored and controlled in the coupon system, according to data from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia.
The Šoštanj thermal power plant emits the most CO2
The largest polluter with carbon dioxide in Slovenia is the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant (Teš) in the Šaleška Valley, which last year released 3,760,438 tons of carbon dioxide. ""The price of coupons is rising, Teš's business is really endangered,"" warns Jernej Vrtovec, Minister of Infrastructure.
The increase in the prices of emission coupons therefore has a negative impact on Teša's operations, says dr. Viktor Vračar, General Manager of Holding Slovenske elektrarne (HSE) and Teša. ""Excluding the costs of CO2 emission coupons, TEŠ would cover all its operating costs at current electricity prices."" Due to the state's commitments to abandon the use of coal, the Ministry of Infrastructure supports the year 2033, when this could be done. But it is speculated that the rise in Teš coupon prices would have plunged it into a bad financial position sooner. According to Viktor Vrečar, the cost of coupons at the current price is between 67 and 68 euros, depending on the lease term, which is 2.4 times the price of coal for Teš. ""That at 100 million means 240 million for coupons at today's price, depending of course on the amount of consumption of this coal.""
But Robert Golob from Gen-I is clear, he says that the current problems that HSE has with Teš should not be confused with the business model, which is supposed to be unsustainable due to coupons. ""This is not true at all. The current problems stem from completely different reasons and coupons are a very small stone in this mosaic, but they are a convenient excuse for incompetent administration. This is true. In reality, however, coupons are no reason close quickly or before 2030. "" Gen energija, which is half the owner of Gen-I, owns 50 percent of the Krško Nuclear Power Plant.
Who makes money by reselling coupons
In 2020, 106 accounts of plant operators and aircraft operators and 47 accounts of those who trade in emission coupons but are not plant operators were registered in the European Union Register for Slovenia, according to the Court of Audit.
Emission allowances that have not been awarded free of charge under the national allocation plan are sold at auction. Slovenia, along with 24 other Member States, is included in the joint auction system operated by the EEX exchange in Leipzig, Germany. The price of emission coupons at auctions is determined by the market. SID Bank is the official auctioneer, which sells emission coupons in the name and on behalf of Slovenia.
In 2019, Slovenia sold 2.7 million coupons worth 65 million euros at auction.
Coupons are traded by carbon-emitting devices, as well as by individuals, companies that have used emissions trading for good business. One of the most successful in trading is Boštjan Bandelj, the owner of Belektron, whose main activity is trading in emission coupons. This year, Bandelj was ranked 23rd among the richest Slovenes, his fortune is estimated at 75.2 million euros. His company Belektron, which had 818 million euros in revenue and 9.5 million euros in profit last year, is also doing well. In 2019, Belektron had as much as one billion in revenue.
Bandelj is the majority owner of Belektron Ekotrading, 80 percent of the company is owned, 15 percent is owned by Jernej Kozlevčar through Nanoleah, and the remaining 10 percent is owned by GBI or Matej Kozar. Both companies - Belektron Ekotrading and GBI - also trade in emission coupons.
In addition to the above, Bandelj has four other companies - GradMat, B&B Nepremičnine, Skrinjica and Skrinja BB. They have various activities - renting construction machinery, trading in their own real estate, business and business consulting, organization of construction projects. Boštjan Bandelj was not ready to answer our questions.
He also trades Gen-I
At Gen-I, which also trades in emission coupons, they say the emission coupon scheme is good, its purpose is right. ""The problems with climate change today stem from the fact that we have burned fossil fuels for the past 200 years, producing greenhouse gas emissions and storing them in the atmosphere at a price of 0. That's not fair. Because it's an artificial scheme, it had in Its 15-year history has several problems that are being addressed. The fact that similar schemes have been introduced by other countries around the world (New Zealand, Australia, the United States and China) shows that this approach is the right one. ""
Robert Golob adds that without this mechanism, everyone would be looking for excuses today, even in Slovenia, why we do not have to give up coal. ""Today, the burden of emission coupons is so strong that it is forcing dirty industries to seriously consider investing in a green breakthrough because it is cheaper than paying for coupons."" He therefore says that from this point of view, this market mechanism is very useful for future development. Otherwise, it would not be enough on its own, but it has been very useful in helping to direct large polluters, so that now is the time to do something, he adds.
1.6 million free coupons awarded in 2020
According to the Ministry of the Environment and Spatial Planning, 1,611,271 emission coupons were distributed free of charge in 2020, and 6,095,593 tons of CO2 were produced, which means that polluters had to buy an additional 4,484,322 coupons. Salonit Anhovo (511,881), Talum (162,474) and Sij Acroni (76,123) received the most free coupons this year. For the period 2021–2025, Slovenian devices received a total of 6,817,759 free emission coupons.
According to Andrej Gnezd from the Umanotera association, the Slovenian foundation for sustainable development, a huge amount of unused coupons has accumulated over the years. This is because too many coupons are given to the industry for free, which is also a major drawback of the system, he says. According to CAN Europe, there were as many as 1.6 billion unused coupons last year. ""This, of course, lowers the price of the coupons, the efficiency of the system itself, but on the other hand, it allows for various speculations and additional earnings for the industry through trading these coupons.""
He adds that these coupons should be withdrawn from the market. Part of the system is the annual reduction in the number of coupons, but the reduction rate is significantly too small, estimates Gnezda. The Union is doing this precisely with the reform of the ETS system, but the problem is that too few coupons are being withdrawn from the market. ""In the past it was 1.74 percent a year, now it is 2.2 percent, but if you want to bring the system in line with the Paris Agreement, it should be at least 5 percent."" In 2019, t also came to life. i. reserve for market stability, which should also help reduce unused coupons in circulation, but even in this case we should increase the amount or. the percentage of unused coupons that would be transferred to the reserve if they wanted to ensure the proper functioning of the system, he says.
The industry serves with unused coupons
Carbon market watch prepared an overview of how redundant coupons were traded, how the industry also served through the transfer of coupons, which were otherwise received free of charge, to end users. They also found that the industry in Slovenia earned about 50 to 80 million in the period between 2008 and 2019, precisely with too many allocated coupons and trading in surplus coupons.
It is also important for the operation of the system that coupons are withdrawn from the market in the event that a certain plant closes, adds Andrej Gnezda. ""In this part, the Environmental Protection Act is harmful, as the amendments propose that coupons remain in circulation even in the event that the plant closes. So there will be too many coupons on the market again, which will weaken the system itself.""
'On paper, the system is effective'
The system is - at least on paper - effective in reducing emissions by regulating emissions in the ETS sector. However, the economic crisis has also contributed to the reduction of emissions in the ETS sector, the covid epidemic has or will have a similar impact, as have other sectoral policies, such as support for renewable energy sources in some EU member states, says Andrej Gnezda. ""In some sectors, the trading system did not provide a serious incentive for companies to invest in reducing emissions, especially if companies were eligible for free coupons.
We should set a minimum carbon price
We should set a minimum carbon price that would rise gradually and should rise to at least 180 EUR / t CO2 in the next two decades. ""According to Andrej Gnezd, setting a minimum price would provide companies with a stable environment and easier planning and investment decisions. .
Reasons for the growth of coupons
According to the Energy Agency, the increase in coupon prices was mainly influenced by the European Commission's policy, which over the years set clear guidelines for CO2-neutral Europe by 2050. The Energy Chamber says coupon prices have been low for a long time. it also attracts speculators. ""Some believe that such activities should be scrutinized, while others point to an open and functioning market. It is estimated that coupon prices will continue to rise, but that they are not key to high electricity prices.""
The Ministry of the Environment estimates that the reasons for the increase in emission coupon prices are several, as their market price depends mainly on the amount of free emission coupons, the price of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), increase energy efficiency of licensed devices. GHG emissions, fuel price parities, especially coal and natural gas, electricity prices and demand, weather conditions, mainly the impact of extremely low air temperatures in winter and economic growth or recession.
The Energy Agency of the Republic of Slovenia adds that higher electricity consumption and consequently higher electricity production also contributed to the increase in the price of emission coupons, coal and gas, which led to increased use of fossil fuel sources. And so the need to purchase additional emission coupons also increased directly.
More funds in the climate fund due to record coupon prices
Revenues generated from the sale of emission coupons at auction, mostly by Teša, are a source of funding for the Climate Change Fund, the purpose of which is to co-finance measures to mitigate and adapt to the consequences of climate change. The fund is managed by the Ministry of the Environment. This summer, the ministry prepared a plan to distribute 430 million from the climate fund.
Umanotera warns about the proposal to cover indirect costs of emissions to the largest polluters in Slovenia, proposed by the Ministry of the Environment through the Environmental Protection Act, which they believe is harmful and opposed. ""In practice, this proposal will award a total of almost 100 million euros to more than 10 companies that are among the largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions and the largest consumers of energy in Slovenia in the next few years. the same companies are already enjoying a host of other redundancies through lower excise duties and renewable energy contributions on energy purchases and a lower CO2 tax, all of which are worth more than € 10 million every year right now. "" However, this is contrary to the very meaning of the system, if we want inefficient sources that produce high greenhouse gases from the market, then we should not artificially lower their price, they say.
At the same time, they do not add any specific provisions that these companies should reduce their energy consumption, reduce their emissions or there is no effective mechanism that would seriously encourage them to restructure. The only condition is that they consume enough energy or pollute enough.
On the other hand, residents are hearing that we need a second block of nuclear power plants and dams on rivers to 'be able to recharge our smartphones and tablets'. It is cheap populism of energy and politicians. in industry, and with policies such as the indirect cost recovery scheme, we encourage them to be even more greedy at best. "" According to them, support in industry should be directed to companies that reduce their carbon footprint and energy consumption, and not to those that generate the most emissions in Slovenia and consume the most energy.
But the Chamber of Commerce welcomes this proposal. ""It is important that our country implements those regulations that our competitors already know. The regulation for the reimbursement of indirect emissions is already skyrocketing. We have not been able to establish the reimbursement of indirect emissions for nine years. If all this were established, then all energy-intensive the industry would not have such problems today, ""explains Vesna Nahtigal.
Currently, Teš is the one who mostly fills the climate change fund. If we close it, the revenues of the climate fund will be so much lower, they say in Umanotera. But Robert Golob says that what's worse is that we already have quite a bit of money today, and we don't use hundreds of millions in the account. ""With the money we have in our account, we could do something useful today, but somehow we are not succeeding. It is banal that it depends entirely on the operational capacity of the government and no one else, obviously we are very, very lame here. in the operational ability of the government to use the money it has in its account usefully. I emphasize the usefulness, because it knows how to spend it, but here it must be useful and purposeful. ""
The same is pointed out at the Chamber of Commerce: ""More money flowed into the fund due to the high price of coupons, so there is certainly undistributed money that could be allocated for those who would prove that it represents a high cost.""
The growth of emission coupon prices is expected in the future as well
Analysts from European and international institutions (Bloomberg New Energy Finance, Commerzbank, Macquarie, Morgan Stanley, etc.) continue to expect emission coupon prices, citing the functioning of the Market Stability Mechanism, additional environmental commitments from the European Union and growing interest. product by financial as well as individual investors.
At Gen-I, they say, when emission coupons began trading fifteen years ago, they were worth € 30 per tonne, then the price dropped and was below € 10 for a number of years. ""During all this time, the European Commission has clearly communicated that it is pursuing significantly higher prices when managing the scheme, otherwise the green transition will not be triggered, it will not be financially motivated. Therefore, the growth of coupons in recent years is in line with expectations."" Whether it will continue and what the highest price may be, however, is very difficult to predict, they say. In the next five to 10 years, major international industrial companies are operating at a price of over 100 euros per tonne of CO2 in their strategic planning and decision-making.
At EU level, a major part of energy legislation is promising - raising the targets for renewable energy, energy efficiency and renewing coupon trading by lowering the emission ceiling. This will affect the price of emission coupons and thus Teš's business.

Despite spending two years thinking about a new venture and studying the current state of American politics, he is not yet embarking on this path.","Matthew McConaughey has finally clarified what his plans are for the future. Among these, there is certainly no imminent entry into politics. He announced that he would not run for the post of governor of the US state of Texas, despite the fact that he had focused on political topics for the past two years.
The 52-year-old said he was researching, studying, listening to American politics and contemplating candidacy during that time. He said he was exploring ways to be as helpful as possible to his family and the society in which he lives. '' As a simple young man born in the small town of Uvalde, Texas, I never thought about ever embarking on the path of a political leader. It is a humble and inspiring path. But it is also a path that I have decided not to take at this time. ""
He said he learned many things in the two years behind him: '' We have a lot of problems that we need to solve. Our policy needs a new purpose. We are burdened by divisions that need healing. We need more trust in our lives. '' Although he did not decide to run this time, he explained that he would continue to support businessmen, companies and foundations that create new paths to success, and organizations whose mission is to serve and build trust. while creating prosperity. He described this kind of action as an American dream in which politicians can help.
McConaughey has spoken out in the past about speculation about his candidacy. In March, he said on the Jimmy Fallon show: '' This is something I'm thinking about, absolutely. Even thinking about it seems to me a noble act. '' Despite the current decision, he has not closed the door to politics."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/ena-na-en-franc-kangler.html,Franz Kangler: Zoran Janković serves a deep state,"He was one of the most controversial mayors, swept away by radar. In Ljubljana, as an MP, he passionately and stubbornly defended Styria and Maribor, but in the capital at the time they did not know very well what to think of him. Until the installation of radars, the people of Maribor adored him, he was a kind of Ljubljana antipode. In the last elections, he almost managed to return, as the current mayor Arsenovič defeated him only in the second round. It was marked by court proceedings. He is now an influential state secretary at the ministry of one of the most controversial members of Janša's government, Aleš Hojs. The opposition accuses them of subordinating the Police to politics. Is Franc Kangler a populist or a victim of litigation? Will he succeed in breaking into parliament on the Let's Connect Slovenia list in the next elections?","Franc Kangler and Uroš Slak start the conversation with radars. Almost a decade ago, they drove the people of Maribor to the streets and gave Kangler the mayor's chair. Nevertheless, when asked if this was his biggest political mistake so far, words are hard to say. ""In my opinion, it would be a matter of political responsibility in the part that we did not know how to communicate to the public how and in what way these radars will work,"" he finally replied.
""It was not about radars at all, it was about green waves, it was about cameras, the intersections were supported by cameras. it would come to life, come in seven or five and in my estimation some life would also be saved, ”he still advocates a project that has shaken his political career. He also sees nothing controversial in the unique public-private partnership, which provided Iskra with 92 percent of all fines collected. ""It was a show for the media. That amount and that percentage would be the one to cover the investment, and from the coverage of the investment onwards, the money would be distributed differently.""
Does he think that the people of Maribor have already forgiven his radars? ""I'm not going to be forgiven here. The people of Maribor know exactly how controversial Kangler was as mayor, but he was also the one who proved that if someone in Maribor has the will and desire, everything that some people used to have authorities promised, also fulfilled. "" He listed the puppet theater, as well as the stadium, animal shelter and gondola. ""People and voters are always right.""
He still believes that the people of Maribor are in his favor. That is, that, as he said, almost everyone else “appreciates my work, respects me”. He was convinced of this by the election results. He twice became mayor, once he was elected in the first round, and in the last elections he had to concede victory to Saša Arsenović only in the second. ""Even now, when I'm going to Maribor, they persuade me to come back, but I'm not thinking about it.""
And yet, if we go back to 2012, does it seem to him that he waited too long with his resignation at the time? ""No,"" he replied. ""When Deputy Mayor Milan Mikl informed me that these leftists, who are also loud in the parliament today, who were in the background in Maribor at the time, want to kill a policeman and make bloody hands on me, I decided to resign. I resign because one life of a police officer is worth more than my mayoralty. "" He says they also found evidence, explosive bodies that the protesters allegedly had ready to throw among the police, but the police then had to throw into the Drava. ""Obviously some influences are so strong that some are subject to rules and others are not,"" he added.
According to him, Ljubljana Mayor Zoran Janković is one of the others. ""There is a big difference between me and Zoran Janković. Zoran Janković serves a deep state and has a lot of media support,"" he explained why Janković can set up radars in Ljubljana, but the citizens do not take to the streets.
He does not doubt for a moment that the courts had double standards when dealing with him and Janković. ""Certainly. If Mr. Janković dares to say on television, on Croatian television, that as long as he is against Janez Janša, he will not have to be afraid of Slovenian courts, and then it turns out, then this is a big question for everyone from But I, as a politician, will not judge this, but I think that in Slovenia we should dig a deep hole in the judiciary, in procedural actions in the courts, regardless of the cases we have in Slovenia, and provide a model Eastern European democracies have such legislation that people will find justice and truth in court. ""
So, like Janković, does he consider himself a victim of court proceedings? “I’m not talking about victims, I’m talking about a system that allows that,” he replies. ""To tell me the judge, Kangler works on a farm, poses a serious threat to return to politics, he has to go to jail. What assessment is that? The judge says that in front of reporters. July 7, 2014. I will never forget that date.""
He disagrees with the claim that the criminal charges filed against him, however, show that he walked on the edge, as most of the evidence in court was wasted due to procedural errors. He is still convinced that he is the victim of revenge by the investigating judge Janez Žirovnik, who ordered wiretaps for him. ""Just as not all politicians are, not all judges are fair,"" he said, recalling that Žirovnik did not withdraw from the proceedings against him, despite a long-running dispute.
He links the judge's dislike to his membership of the parliamentary Committee on Security and Intelligence Oversight. ""Do you know why? Because he went to the commissions. Next to the director. I, Moge and Jerovšek proved to them that they were working on the edge, illegally. That they had an agent who had a tracking device in his shoe and that they were involved in the theft of weapons in the Postojna barracks or in Pivka, ""he says. He also mentions a magnetogram that mysteriously disappeared in the Temple of Democracy on the day the parliamentary inquiry was filed, and that ""in addition to the policeman in Tomšič Avenue, all four tires on his car were cut. And the cameras did not work that day.""
He illustrated the double standards to his Facebook followers with the case of a Maribor woman who did not issue an invoice when she sold something for a euro and a half. He continued that when one of the sons of the mayor of Ljubljana cheated the state for 60 thousand euros, he was sentenced to only 2,000 euros. He wanted to say that those who are close to the Janković family are treated with privilege, he confirms when asked by Uroš Slak. I was persecuted for a 40-year-old tractor worth 5,000 euros, how could I afford it with a deputy's salary. I’ve been to court eight times, he says. ""In Ljubljana, the most notorious family is written off once 16 million, and the second time. No one crosses the threshold of the court. That is, someone gave them 16 million. There is no responsibility.""
Kangler on Police and Throwing a Rifle in Corn
A former MP, former mayor and former state councilor, he began his career as a criminalist. He was one of the top three, he claims. Today, as a secretary at the Ministry of the Interior, he is again close to the Police. ""It seems to you that with the recent amendment of the Law on the Functioning of the Police, when the mandates of police chiefs ended, you allowed an intrusion into the Police, only this time by the SDS, by you. Given your bad experience with the Police, with the operation of repressive apparatuses, one would expect you to advocate for greater autonomy, ”Slak challenges him. ""The police are autonomous,"" he said, and continued. with letters, it was all proven. We just followed that and it is also right that there is a re-election that there is not one commander in one post for 10 or 15 years. ""
“If you ask me, it’s not about influence,” he continues. However, according to this law, the final agreement on the criteria for the selection of new commanders is given by the Minister of the Interior, ie politics. ""It's about criteria, and the decision is made by the CEO. It's about a professional decision, about professionalism,"" Kangler continues. ""The director appointed by this government will appoint new police chiefs. The director is at the will of this government. That is, you will reset the police at your political will,"" Slak said. Kangler said: ""You have this feeling. But you didn't have that feeling when the previous government was, when Mrs Bobnar and Mr Poklukar wanted to do it. That was their proposal."" ""But they didn't do that."" ""Yes, because they threw a rifle in the corn and preferred to go home. Because they didn't deal with the problems of the Police, as we do. To buy equipment, to take care of the police, to keep the police safe, to take care of their salaries,"" he said. Kangler ready answer.
Kangler - political populist as needed
Kangler, who admits to being a political populist when needed (""Sometimes you have to be if you want to survive. Sometimes you can't get information to people other than this way."") Hopes for a new breakthrough in the National Assembly in the next election. Bets on the political project Let's Connect Slovenia, where the SLS, its New People's Party, SMC, GAS (Economically Active Party) and the Greens of Slovenia are united in a single list. ""In 30 years, something that one would never expect has happened. On the one hand, we have the KUL coalition, which excludes everyone who is far left, radical. On the other, we have a coalition. And this KUL coalition says that any of you He cooperated with the government of Janez Janša, he has no perspective with us. ""We are convinced that we unite and connect dissidents in terms of interest to ensure a legally just and fair Slovenia in the future,"" he added, adding that they are going to vote for a Slovenia that will be fair and honest to the smallest man, ensuring a more equal regional development. ""It's not fair that I have to die two or three years earlier because I live in Styria than someone who lives in the center or in central Slovenia. These are statistics.""
But if we go back to the here and now: what kind of Prime Minister does Janez Janša think? Good, he says. ""Given the circumstances in which this government found itself, and given the experience of the SMC, Zdravko Počivalšek and his ministers, there is a greater dialogue in this government than in the previous one, that this government is working after projects, programs, then every word in this place is superfluous to me. But I can say that at the moment he is the only European-profiled president who can pick up the phone and call or contact 40 prime ministers across Europe or around the world. ""
So where will they lean if there is a tab on the scales between KUL and SDS in parliament? ""You have to live in the world long enough. You experience everything and you survive everything. And I'm sure you will experience that too,"" he initially avoids the answer. He then claims that they are not excluding anyone, but adds in the same breath: ""I personally do not see myself and my partisans in a coalition with the Left. The left is the extreme left, it is harmful to the Slovenian economy, it is harmful to the Slovenian nation. I would like to drown a farmer in a spoonful of water or an entrepreneur or a rich man who brought wealth from abroad to Slovenia, because they wanted to nationalize Pipistrel and Boscarol, but I don't know who else, they say publicly in Parliament. ""
Let's connect Slovenia is mentioned as one of the players who would mean the formation and continuation of Janša's government after the elections, together with SDS and NSi. ""I do not rule out this possibility, but we are working to have a good candidate for prime minister,"" Kangler replied, and then confirmed rumors that this could be the first man of Novo mesto's Krka, Jože Colarič. ""According to the information I have, and as far as I'm concerned, my personal view is a big reality, he's welcome if he decides, I'm happy to support that."""
https://www.24ur.com/sport/ostalo/zdruzenje-wta-zaskrbljeno-zaradi-nejasne-usode-pengove.html,The WTA is concerned about Pengo's unclear fate,"WTA International Tennis Players Association President Steve Simon has expressed ""deep concern"" over the unclear fate of Chinese tennis player Shuai Peng, who has disappeared from public life on charges of sexual assault by a senior Chinese politician. Simon tried to make contact with Peng through various channels, but without success.","""He also sent two e-mails, and it is clear from the answers that she wrote them under the influence of others or were censored. Simon therefore remains deeply concerned about Peng's fate that she is not free, that she is under complete control and cannot communicate freely. , ""open and direct,"" a WTA spokeswoman told the French news agency AFP.
The now 35-year-old Peng, a former world number one in women's doubles and a two-time grand slam tournament winner, has not been seen much in public since she accused Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault on November 2.
On November 21, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that the president of the umbrella sports organization, Thomas Bach, had a half-hour video interview with Peng. The evidence so far that she is alive and well has been published mainly in the Chinese media, where a new video and photo of Shuai Peng was published a few days ago at the opening of the youth tournament in Beijing.
Many tennis players came to support Peng, including Peter Kvitov, Naomi Osaka, Serena Williams, Simona Halep, as well as players, including Andy Murray, Felician Lopez ...
Chinese authorities have not yet confirmed the whereabouts of the missing tennis player. Neither Zhang, the former deputy prime minister of China, nor the current Chinese government has commented on Peng's allegations. The discussion on this topic, however, was blocked on the heavily censored Chinese Internet, as well as on other social networks.
China's foreign ministry said only that ""people should end the deliberate manipulation of events around Peng."""
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/lms-je-resitve-za-razvoj-slovenije-strnil-v-12-krovnih-tock.html,"'After the elections, we will have to deal with loose public finances and chaos in all systems'","LMŠ champion Marjan Šarec emphasized at the party's program congress that the LMŠ's focus is on the post-election period, when it will be necessary to ""face all the consequences of the current government"", from loose public finances to chaos in all systems. The development-oriented program thus proposes solutions for normalization based on democratic values, he says.","At the LMŠ program congress, around 300 delegates approved the party's program entitled Normalization. Solutions. Development. With the program, which last year consisted of 247 members in 17 program committees, the party will address the 78 challenges that await Slovenia in the future. 373 solutions.
According to the program, the main goal of the party is ""Slovenia's development breakthrough, which will be based on investments in science and efforts for a high-value economy, because only this will bring prosperity to the people."" At the same time, the party emphasizes that politics must start dealing with good governance, leaving the profession to ""seek and find the right ways to deal with a complex future"" in cooperation with politics.
In his introductory address, party president Marjan Šarec was critical of the current government, but stressed the need to look ahead. ""The new government will have to make changes wherever the current government subordinates institutions that are supposed to be independent and necessary for the existence and functioning of the state,"" he said, adding that this was not a threat but a promise. ""The promise for the country that we citizens want,"" he said, adding: ""If we come to power to use some old patterns of the center-left that did not want to offend anyone, then we will not even use this power. valuable.
He emphasized that the program proposed solutions for normalization and development, while the party respected the constitutional order and division of powers and their autonomy, and advocated respect for human rights and freedoms and the rule of law and the welfare state. According to him, the program sets the LMŠ as a development liberal-party, ""which wants to work for the wider good and take care of the development of society as a whole"".
One of the biggest challenges will be tackling the consequences of the covida-19 epidemic in various fields. The party's program therefore addresses the treatment of incapacitated patients, queues in health care, the situation of the elderly in nursing homes, the plight of schoolchildren due to inadequate education, unemployment in tourism and hospitality and non-payment of financial aid to sole proprietors, Šarec explained.
As the company is facing major challenges due to the period of transformation, the client's priority is also to invest in science, research and promote innovation. According to Šarc, the key challenges will also be tackling climate change, ensuring Slovenia's energy independence and inflation. However, Šarec is convinced that the latter will be able to be managed by balancing between investing in investments and taking care of public finances, which must be resistant to stress tests of all kinds. ""Borrowing in itself is not a tragedy, it becomes when borrowing is not an investment, but a matter of buying social peace,"" he stressed.
Šarec is convinced that LMŠ has so far proved to be a ""principled party and we intend to continue to do so in the future"". ""What we advocated in 2018, we advocate today, more experienced, stronger."" As he added, the party has traversed a path ""from the bottom up, from the local level to state politics"". According to him, when they won second place in the 2018 parliamentary elections, they had two options: to let the relative winner form a government with the help of the President of the Republic, or to try and form a different coalition.
According to Šarec, after the coalition coordination, Slovenia got its first minority government, during which standards were in force that are ""unattainable for those in power today"". As he added, ""many only now, when we have a truly far-right government that does not care about any democratic norm, realize that our government was not so bad."" According to Šarč, the goal of the LMŠ is not ""to rule, but to manage the state for the common good, as politics must reflect the will of the people"".

Among other things, the program advocates for a better life for all generations, while announcing a solution to the housing problem for young people, that ""owning an apartment will be a real option and not a privilege."" To this end, they will establish housing cooperatives, establish a public rental service and increase the funds of public rental housing. At the same time, they promise the possibility of acquiring the first owner-occupied apartment by paying the rent.
According to the party's program, a new pillar of the welfare state would become a system of long-term supply with stable financial resources. One of the most important goals in the LMŠ is the strengthening of accessible and high-quality public health care, which is expected to eliminate the consequences of the covida-19 epidemic on the health care system. They predict that they will abolish supplementary health insurance and introduce payment for health services according to the realization and not according to the contract plan, and demand optimal use of all available material and human resources for ""the quickest possible elimination of inadmissible queues"".
The party is also announcing an increase in net salaries for all employees with tax relief, such as relieving recourse or 13th salary, they will also relieve the 14th salary or Christmas bonus. At the same time, residents will be encouraged to voluntarily activate bank deposits by issuing special-purpose government bonds with a guaranteed return for the construction of housing for young people, energy facilities and infrastructure.
Ensuring stable, healthy and long-term balanced public finances will also be crucial for the party, Igor Peček emphasized at the presentation of the party's program. They also consider it important to create a stimulating, predictable, stable and internationally competitive business environment without unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles. According to the party, they will also advocate the establishment of a dialogue at the Economic and Business Council.
As Vojmir Urlep, a member of the program committee, emphasized at the presentation of the program, it is necessary to talk about economic growth, which means both a development breakthrough and the provision of funds to cover social needs. Therefore, according to him, three orientations are key, namely the green transition, increasing added value and digital transformation.
They insist on changing the system of parliamentary elections by introducing an optional relative priority vote at the constituency level. They are also in favor of a professional and independent judiciary and the media, maintaining dialogue with the professional public and representatives of civil society, they said in presentations of the program, which they then confirmed with majority support.
Lareš has concluded an agreement on post-election cooperation with the opposition SD, Levica and SAB, but each party will run in the elections independently, Šarec reminded. According to him, LMŠ does not deal with other parties, but wants to show its program and how they see the future, as Slovenia faces major challenges, including regulating the health system, green transformation, regulating public finances, transforming the economy and solving housing problems of young people. ""We are interested in this in the future, we have never gone to throw logs under our feet and we will not,"" Šarec emphasized.
He also emphasized that the party ""speaks the same way as they did in 2018"". According to him, when they were in government, they did not cling to power, and after the election they will do the same as they did in the past. “We’re going to have high standards, which today, when no one takes responsibility, is science fiction,” he said.
The party's vice-president and MP Jerca Korča and party vice-president Igor Žavbi also addressed the gathering, emphasizing that their ranks include individuals of all generations and social classes, adding that he believes they will have even more members next year.
The leader of the parliamentary group, Brane Golubović, said that people are the key to solving every social challenge, adding that there are many challenges. He was also critical of the current government. ""In LMŠ we believe that this is not the Slovenia we want, so we are not and will not be silent,"" he said.
Greetings from abroad were also heard, including MEP Stephan Sejourn, President of the European group Renew Europe, of which LMŠ is also a member. Sejourne also expressed LMŠ's support in ""exposing the abuses of the current government and changing the government in Slovenia"". After introductory speeches, participants began a discussion on the party’s program."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/tnp-ob-vzpostavitvi-mirnih-obmocij-omejuje-dostope-na-pokljuki.html,"Due to wild roosters, TNP restricts access to Pokljuka","As part of a project to improve the status of species and habitat types, the Triglav National Park Public Institution (TNP) set up several barricades on forest roads in Pokljuka in September to establish peaceful areas for the capercaillie. The inmates surprised visitors, and TNP promises to step up information.","As part of the Vrh Julijcev project, nine quiet areas for the capercaillie and three quiet areas for active high bogs are planned to be established in the Pokljuka area. A regime of complete restriction of access to bog areas will be established in the bogs. In quiet areas for the capercaillie, there is a time limit on access or exclusively the use of marked trails.
As the head of the TNP nature protection department Andrej Arih explained, the free use of space is limited in quiet areas. Thus, visitors to the approximately 800 hectares of land in Pokljuka will no longer be able to freely access and engage in hiking, gathering or other activities. Warning signs will be set up on the entrance routes, and already in September in Pokljuka, where there are already 17 locks, an additional 11 locks have been set up, on forest roads, where motor traffic would negatively affect the habitat of the capercaillie. The locks were placed mainly on the circular road from Kranjska planina to Zajavornik mountain and back towards Viševnik.
Some prisoners were released only for certain periods, with a fine of € 500
According to Arih, the project partners, including the Mountaineering Association of Slovenia and Tourism Bohinj, have been coordinating for some time regarding the locations of the prisons. Other stakeholders also took part, from the public forestry service and landowners to the Society for the Observation and Study of Birds of Slovenia. Regimes of permissible use of forest road sections with located barriers are different and may include a restriction of use throughout the year, or this applies only during the period of maximum sensitivity of the capercaillie. Where this is the case, the locks will be lifted during the part of the year when the restriction does not apply and will allow the use of forest roads.
Compliance with the restrictions will be monitored by the TNP nature conservation control service. ""In the beginning, we will raise awareness and inform people, but in the future we will also envisage a stricter penal policy,"" said the head of the service, Sašo Hrovat, adding that fines of 500 euros are envisaged.
First of all, they will pay a lot of attention to the wider information campaign, which was not carried out during the construction of the prisons, which caused some visitors to be in a bad mood. It even happened that some of the vehicles remained trapped behind the gates, which were first raised and then lowered. The TNP public institution now promises to take care of the ongoing release of prisoners and also to provide better information.
As they explained, they conducted intensive communication with the public about the project at the beginning of last year. But then last year, due to the epidemic, they did not mark quiet areas, and this fall, the prisoners surprised visitors. The public institution TNP apologizes to them, but otherwise they believe that the majority of visitors to Pokljuka will accept the imposed restrictions with understanding.
Additional locks on Pokljuka are not planned for now
According to them, the locks on Pokljuka are located exclusively on sections of forest roads where uncontrolled general use would nullify the importance and purpose of peaceful areas important for vulnerable endangered species. For now, no additional locks are planned in Pokljuka. Depending on how this regime works in Pokljuka, similar measures will be implemented in the future in some other areas of the park, where the pressure of visitors is also great and can negatively affect the survival of the capercaillie, squirrel and black grouse. namely in certain forest areas of the southern Bohinj mountains.
""Visits to the park have been increasing in recent years and certain animal and plant species are also affected. We will see if this is the right approach to achieving the park's goals to provide animals and plants with normal living conditions for the conservation of individual species,"" he said. Hrovat.
As explained by the head of the information and education service of TNP Majda Odar, hiking and ski touring routes have been established where visitors are welcome. But there are also areas that the wildlife needs for basic functions to survive the winter and to reproduce in the spring. In quiet areas, therefore, in a certain part of the year, movement is allowed only on marked routes or crossings are completely prohibited. However, these are relatively small areas, she assured."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/inspektor/zenske-v-filmu.html,Women in the movie,"In 25 years, women have directed 23 feature films, men 146. The average film budget for a director, according to the Slovenian Film Center, is one million euros, for a director 800 thousand. Why are directors paid better, why do they get more opportunities?","In Slovenia, we got the first feature film signed by a woman in 2002. It was the film Guardian of the Border by director Maja Weiss. Since then, women have directed more, but still less than men. In film - as it is right - quality counts, good film counts. But the conditions must be the same for everyone - for men and women. Especially in such a demanding, often even brutal industry as film, in which, if you are not present all the time, they forget you overnight.
The original sin of male dominance in the film world probably stems from patriarchal values ​​that characterize our society and environment, says Sonja Prosenc, one of the most recognizable Slovenian directors and author of History of Love, a Slovenian candidate for a foreign language Oscar who has received 13 international awards. and domestic awards. The film ranked her in the Golden Album of European Directors, in the top fifty best directors of the Old Continent for the last 20 years. ""We're all kind of used to this predominantly male narrative canon, it's close to us and other views seem foreign to us, unequal.""
The data are telling: only a fifth of female directors work in Europe, making at least one feature film between 2003 and 2017. According to the latest data, 44% of female directors and 56% of female directors work in the Slovenian film sector - so the difference is not large. Since 2011, support for filmmakers' projects has been growing. Also in some tenders, such as screenplay development, and in short films, female directors are just as successful as male directors. But beware: as part of the national film program, between 1995 and 2020, we received 23 feature films signed by women and as many as 146 male films. And one more thing: men’s films are better paid. The average film budget for a director is just under one million euros, and for a director more than 800,000. The average support of the film center for directors is 400 thousand, for directors just under 300. The maximum film budget for men is almost two million 400,000, and for female directors a million and a half euros. Inappropriate comments on the set
“I’ve never felt like someone actively fighting for women’s rights in the film world, but given that the pay figures are really different, I think it’s important that we demand equal opportunities, that we get paid equally for equal work , ""says young director Maja Doroteja Prelog. He has not had a bad experience with filming - with the extremely sexist remarks of professors at the Academy of Theater, Radio, Film and Television. Sonja Prosenc also says that the teams are professional and that she never thinks about being a woman on the set. But I experienced such a sexist outburst of a team member and thought ‘Okay, I’m eating, I’m moving on.’ Meanwhile, our main player, Kristoffer Jonner, who comes from a different background, from Norway, where the standards are different, had a completely different reaction and it seemed to him that this man should leave the recording studio the same day. "" And this is crucial: zero tolerance, says Matevž Luzar, director and screenwriter, president of the Slovenian Directors' Association. Gender inequality has been a topic in recent years.
Inequality between authors in Slovenian film was also discussed at this year's Liff. Festival director Simon Popek says: ""This has become a very important topic in recent years due to sex scandals - first in the US and then in Europe, including here."" Popek emphasizes that Slovenian authors have been in the background for a long time, especially female directors. And not just here, but also in the biggest film industry, Hollywood. The most prestigious Oscar for the film was not received by the first director until 2010 - it was Kathryn Bigelow for the film Bomb Mission. Simultaneously with the Me too - Me movement, Popek notes, film festivals around the world have committed themselves to gender equality, so that female directors will be represented in the same number as their male colleagues. A third of the films on Liff were signed by the directors, and five of the ten candidates competed in the competition program. The main award for the water fighter went to Iranian director Panahi's Gas Walks, and the award for best short film went to Špela Čadež for Steakhouse, an animated film about a violent relationship in a family of two with the right amount of spice and technical brilliance, the Liff Commission said. also at the Portorož Slovenian Film Festival. The film Prasica, a derogatory term for a woman, signed by Tijana Zinajić, took as many as six spring, also spring chosen by the audience. Before Tijana Zinajić in 2018, Urša Menart also won the Vesna for the best feature film. So far, 17 men and two directors, the already mentioned Maja Weiss for the Guardian of the Border and Hanna Slak in 2017 for the film Miner, have received the Vesna for Best Director. In the history of awarding this prize, four awards went to screenwriter Melina Pota Koljević, who co-created Ivan Janez Burger, Katja Colja for Igor and Rosa, Iza Strehar for Prasica and Urša Menart for Luzerka. , in which male dominance is rooted. Not anymore. However, as a student, she received comments that she was embarking on a male profession. By constantly proving herself, she let everyone know she could. Inappropriate remarks came only from those I threatened, he says. ""Hysterical babes and such classic remarks, but I don't know which one is cute. But always from people who felt that their time was running out or that they might not be good enough.""
The 23 feature films by female directors over the past 25 years represent 13 percent of all co-funded feature films. With this share, Slovenia remains below the European average. Above it are the Netherlands, Sweden, Latvia, Norway, Austria, Finland, Denmark, Germany and also Croatia.
""Slovenian film has been based on guerrilla enthusiasm for too long, it exploded madly in the late 1990s, when digital cameras became so high quality that you could go to the cinema with this film, but that's how you make your first film and then you want normal production conditions. , ""our scene is described by Popek. Nataša Bučar, director of the Slovenian Film Center, adds: ""We are 110 years behind Sweden. 110 years later we got our first female director."" That is why we at SFC strive to motivate the authors to dare to enter the field of film and insist on it, Bučar points out. The movement for gender equality in the audiovisual industry across Europe has undoubtedly encouraged everyone to open up space for women authors, to move for the better.
What about the situation in Slovenian film? The lost corona year and the blockade of money for filmmakers until the last day of last year caused delays in filming and post-production. The forecast for next year is better: 6 and a half million for the Slovenian Film Center, but beware: this is still far from the promised 11 million. 11 million is a commitment made by the Parliamentary Committee on Culture in 2018. Nataša Bučar warns: ""We are at a good half of the 11 million we hoped for by 2022, as envisaged by the decision of the then Committee on Culture, which still operates today. ""The competent Ministry of Culture is answering: every film first depends on the domestic market and the Slovenian market is not self-sufficient. Therefore, says Secretary Irena Ostrouška, ""it would be good to have as much funding as possible, especially now that the Slovenian Film Festival and Liff have shown that constant investment in films and talents has paid off."" the deadline is not without a strategy of national cultural policy, which must reach a consensus. ""To some extent we have a development strategy. Is that enough? The question is, should we upgrade this with any other considerations?"" Ostrouška wonders. Matevž Luzar is clear. First, we need a clear national policy that will adequately financially support the film. That's 11 million a year. Then we can also look for extra-budgetary resources, just as our Croatian neighbors do. Luzar also warns: ""Politics should put the film on the list of priorities and use it to promote the country, for international recognition.""
We have knowledge, talents, stories. Slovenian film is part of our identity, we know how to make a good film, a good series. Therefore, a different policy awareness is essential.
Take a look at the whole post on voyo.

https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/medvedova-komisija-nadaljevala-z-zaslisanji-isic.html,Police officers Glavič and Rupnik denied political pressure on their work,"The parliamentary commission investigating suspicion of political interference in the work of the Police questioned Nermin Isić, former head of the Public Order and Peace Department at the Ljubljana Police Administration, Janez Rupnik, director of the Ljubljana Police Department, and Boštjan Glavič, former director of the Ljubljana Police Department. Both Rupnik and Glavič denied any political pressure on their work. However, the head of the commission said that the policy of personnel in all key positions in the police had already been achieved, so he feared that there would be even more repression in future police interventions to make him more like the politician.","At that time, Nermin Isić was in charge of guarding the unregistered rally at the operational headquarters. In his opinion, they acted professionally, legally and proportionately, and by taking action they prevented mass violations of public order and peace. After the rally, according to him, the former director of the Ljubljana Police Department, Boštjan Glavič, also received a message from the Director General of the Police, Anton Olaj, that they had done a good job.
Shortly afterwards, on Sunday, Olaj ordered expert supervision of the work of the Ljubljana Police Department, as there were doubts about the impartial operation of the Police and human rights violations against all participants in the rally, he said. They also had to supplement the report after the end of the protection, by defining who gave the order to intervene at the Prešeren monument. This was betrayed by Isić, he said and further explained that they had failed to establish public order and peace with milder measures in a public place.
According to him, the expert supervision found that the police had taken measures to prevent serious and mass violations of public order and peace, the measures were legal and proportionate, the use of coercive means was the mildest, and some irregularities were found regarding the suspicion of impartiality. Shortly afterwards, Isić received a warning before terminating his employment. As he explained, he was accused of violating the principle of equal treatment and equality before the law, because his orders were directed only against one group.
Isić was greatly affected by the labor law measure. He said that in 37 years of work in the Police he had no problems, he was never in disciplinary proceedings, he estimates that he always worked professionally and legally. He also does not know how he would damage the reputation of the police with his decisions, which he was also accused of. He did not have the opportunity to appeal against the imposed measure, which led him to decide to retire.
Isić also said that before the beginning of the June rally, the Minister of the Interior, Aleš Hojs and Olaj, took the lead in security. He informed them about the measures, but because they came forward before the meeting, they did not have an insight into what was happening, nor could they influence decisions. Asked whether the presence of the minister alone could influence his conduct, Isic said no and that he made professional decisions himself.
Asked what the practice of the Police is in protecting rallies when they are attacked by a provocateur or a group of provocateurs, Isić explained that police officers try to prevent violations before the rally itself, but if they do, they remove violators who are with them. started.
Former director of the Ljubljana Police Department Glavič denied any political pressure on his work
Boštjan Glavič, who led the Ljubljana Police Department until 30 September, denied any political pressure on his work at a session of the parliamentary commission. He received a reprimand before the termination of his employment, because on 25 June, at a protest on Prešeren Square, the removal of t. i. yellow jackets. The order to intervene in the protest at the Prešeren monument was given by the head of security Nermin Isić, who also received a warning before the termination of employment, said Glavič today, who started leading the Ljubljana Police Administration at the end of March.
He assured that the police officers worked professionally and legally while intervening in the protest, while preventing serious violations of public order and peace. A call by protester Jaša Jenulla to the police to remove t. i. yellow jackets, but did not affect the work of the police, he stressed at a meeting of the opposition commission of inquiry.
During his time in charge of the Ljubljana Police Administration, State Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior Franc Kangler never visited him, and Minister of the Interior Aleš Hojs only once, together with Police Director General Anton Olaj before the June 25 protests. He denied that the minister would propose any measures to them, but Hojsa was only interested in whether they were ready to protest. He confirmed that they had to prepare a list for the General Police Administration of 30 police officers who took action against the yellow jackets. “It was a little weird,” he admitted. But the list had to be sent to the General Police Administration, not the politicians, he reminded when asked if the request for this list could be described as political pressure.
When asked about the role of Alojz Sladič in the operational headquarters on June 25, he said that his task as a representative of the uniformed police administration was to provide professional assistance. Glavič does not know why he, nor did he know that Sladič was treated as an extremist in the cadet school in 1990 and 1991 because he allegedly wore Nazi symbols and glorified Nazism.
Glavič accepted the reprimand before the termination of his employment, which, according to him, certainly referred to the events of June 25, as final. “I didn’t want to problematize him,” he asserted. But he personally experienced it as a vote of no confidence. He assessed that the trust between him and the Director General of the Police, Olaj, had been broken and that it would therefore be difficult for him to continue working as the Director of the Ljubljana Police Administration. Olaja therefore asked him to be transferred. So he is now the assistant director of the Police Academy in Tacen.
Director of the Ljubljana Police Department: The police action on October 5 was professional and legal
Janez Rupnik denied allegations that police used excessive gas and water jets during the protests on October 5. The police action was professional and legal, he asserted. ""All cases have been considered,"" said Rupnik, who has headed the Ljubljana Police Administration (PU) since 1 October. Protesters violently resisted police, he explained. According to him, protesters at all locations were constantly working against the police.
On the findings from the report of the expert commission that the gas charges were used incorrectly, he said that a minor irregularity could have occurred due to the stressful situation. According to him, certain things cannot be foreseen when using coercive means. Otherwise, the citizens had been warned against an unregistered rally the day before. He pointed out that the legislation does not follow what is happening in practice, so the police have a very difficult task in protecting unreported protests.
According to him, State Secretary at the Ministry of the Interior Franc Kangler and Director General of the Police Anton Olaj also came to the operational headquarters on October 5 to see ""what the situation is"". In doing so, Rupnik denied that Kangler would give any instructions to the police. Asked whether he would resign from the position of director of the Ljubljana Police Department due to the identified irregularities, he stated that he would not.
After the session, the chairman of the commission of inquiry, Medved, estimated that those who decided how to act at the protests on October 5 knew very well what had happened to those who, on June 25, were not strong enough against politics. protesters.
""To live up to the expectations of politics, they acted even harsher than they should have been, and met with applause from politicians and praise that the police, who are constantly firing bullets, are finally the modern European police,"" he said in a statement. According to Medved, politics has already achieved its staff in all key positions in the police, so he fears that there will be even more repression in future police interventions in order to make him more like politicians.
He also commented on the recently published report of the expert commission appointed by the Director General of the Police, Anton Olaj, after a meeting on 5 October in Ljubljana. She assessed that the police officers used coercive means professionally and legally, but nevertheless pointed out some irregularities. The latter was also pointed out by Medved. ""Even the commission set up by the police could not ignore some of the facts we pointed out, namely the excessive use of coercive means, tear gas and water cannon. It wrote this in black and white,"" he said.
Today, the commission confronted the findings of the report with the director of the Ljubljana Police Administration, Rupnik. ""It is striking to find that he does not find this at all controversial, and when asked if we can expect gas bullets to be fired at empty markets again in the future if coercive means are used, he shrugs his shoulders that the situation is on the ground. such that it is difficult to answer what and where they will happen, ""Medved added."
https://www.24ur.com/novice/slovenija/obstanek-ministra-dikaucica-je-predvsem-in-v-prvi-vrsti-poraz-za-naso-drzavo.html,'The stay of Minister Dikaučič is first and foremost a defeat for our country',"The vote on the interpellation against Justice Minister Marjan Dikaučič finally cemented the balance of power in parliament and shattered the opposition's dream of overthrowing at least one Janša government minister who manages to garner enough votes at key moments keeps its ministers in office no matter what they do? This is one of the reasons why the eyes are increasingly focused on the upcoming elections, in which new players will also appear. The center-right pole is expected to be strengthened by the parties united in the Connect Slovenia movement, and the victory of the center-left in the elections will enable Robert Golob to enter politics if he decides to do so.","Even after the last two interpellations, it is quite clear ""that some ministers do not even enjoy any real support in their ranks, but on the other hand, it turned out that the government still has stable support in parliament"". This is how the President of the National Assembly Igor Zorčič comments on the outcome of the last two interpellations. However, the public in the Delo poll strongly showed that politicians are less and less taking responsibility for their work. As many as 75 percent of respondents think so.
At a time when public opinion and politics are polarizing left and right with a virtually non-existent ability to cooperate, new political projects are looking for space in the middle: Connecting Slovenia with already known political names such as Zdravko Počivalšek, Alojz Kovšca and Franc Kangler, Andrej Čuš and Marjan Podobnik. According to a survey by Parsifal, it is ranked on the scale of political election, which leads to parliamentary benches.
Already in May, his party was founded by former Environment Minister Jure Leben, who will address green politics, and mayors are also associated with Vladimir Prebilič at the helm. Former Minister of Agriculture Aleksandra Pivec will convince voters with Naša dežela, and the establishment of her party was also announced by Parliament Speaker Igor Zorčič.
Last but not least, the question arises as to where Robert Golob will continue his political path. “I’m not going to set up my own party, I say this so categorically that I couldn’t do more,” Golob claims. However, he is ready to support a project close to him.
Meanwhile, the DeSUS party, which is barely visible in political polls, is seeking its political survival. According to President Borut Pahor, the elections will take place in April next year.
As early as Monday, we could see in parliament what it means if a minister loses the support of the coalition NSi - with just a short, five-minute debate, without a vote and the demolition of the minister. ""I don't know why this is a surprise. We announced these things. At least I announced them myself,"" said Nova Slovenija's first man, Matej Tonin. For the next two interpellations, against Interior Minister Aleš Hojs and Environment Minister Andrej Vizjak, NSi announces that after deliberation and deliberation, they will make a decision on how to vote.
'The government's only goal is to stay in power and staff it'
""Elections seem to be regular. At LMŠ, we still think that every day when this government is at the top is a missed opportunity,"" says Jerca Korče from LMŠ, who adds that the government's goal is only to stay in power. authorities and staffing in the energy sector, rather than dealing with the current epidemiological situation in the country.
SMC member Gregor Perič is also convinced that the government will last until the end of its term. Until the elections, I would like the opposition to ""overcome at least some constructiveness and not stumble at least those projects that are already underway"". On interpellations, however, he says they invest them every two months and that's all they know: ""That's all you know and offer besides constructive distrust and all the other disruptive things.""
Korčetova: When we think we have reached the bottom, the coalition is going even lower
Perič adds that the SMC is satisfied with what Minister Vizjak did during this term. I would like further clarification from the Minister on what is happening before the time of the current government.
In the meantime, Justice Minister Marjan Dikaučič - as well as Education Minister Simona Kustec before him - endured Monday's interpellation. ""The stay of the minister is first and foremost a defeat for our country,"" Korčet said. That no one in this government is responsible for anything anymore, “once we think we’ve reached the bottom, the coalition goes even lower,” is critical.
""We are talking about having a Minister of Justice who is in the executive branch and is on trial before a court on suspicion of tax evasion. I can't find any more words. Where are we taking this policy and what else is the standard for resignation?"" the interlocutor wonders. Sometimes the standards were completely different, he adds.
Perič, meanwhile, replies that their government has shown that they knew how to overthrow their ministers in the LMŠ. ""One interpellation every two months in this government is no surprise. None of them were successful, and all the arguments we hear have been clarified,"" he added. That they have not been successful in any interpellation so far, nor have they failed to prevent the adoption of the budget and the election of a new constitutional judge, he enumerates.
""All you are offering us is destruction, non-cooperation, smashing and stumbling. But you are not offering any creative solutions or constructive proposals,"" added Perič, who believes that this hard block division into left and right will not bring any results. . ""What you are offering in the KUL coalition - some exclusion, some inability to cooperate and the problems you have in your ranks - this is not what Slovenia needs at the moment. We need very concrete solutions.""
Respect for the rule of law
Korcet, meanwhile, is adamant that the basic standards of the rule of law must be respected: ""Respect for the constitution and the fact that certain criteria must be set. And political responsibility, especially to the state and to the people.""
He points out that confidence in politics and government is falling sharply. He adds that the disunity of ideas in politics is good - ""that we confront ideas, that we are not united, that we confront the content of how to prepare better legislative proposals"". ""However, if you expect unity or support in the conduct of the LMŠ, such as non-compliance with the constitution, that you support the Minister of Justice, who is under judicial investigation before the court… Where have we gone and where are we going?"" he wonders.
He emphasizes that they must set the boundaries of political responsibility. By doing so, they set an example for people that they also respect measures. According to her, the government was completely confused by the epidemic at this point.
Meanwhile, Perič accuses her that LMŠ resigned at the beginning of the epidemic and that it did not take responsibility. He also accuses her of refusing dialogue in politics. A Korčetova: ""Dialogue is, of course, the basis of politics. It leads to better substantive solutions. I do not know a country in the world that would deal with how to overthrow the Slovenian News Agency during the epidemic, instead of dealing with the virus. were dialogical in the case of Dikaučič - there is simply no need to look for dialogue here. This is not politics, this is something else. ""
However, when it comes to substantive issues, the government does not take into account any of their proposals, says Korčet. ""If I did, I dare say the situation would be very different today."" She accuses the government of withdrawing from the epidemic and that it is only about elections.
""I believe we often disagree on a lot of things in politics, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't sit at the same table just because we don't like someone, because someone has done something in the past that doesn't suit us. ""says Perič."
